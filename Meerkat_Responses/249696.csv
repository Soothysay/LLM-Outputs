 HYPOXEMIA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decomponesation
   unclear.  pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known
   COPD, OSA, ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or
   MG).  ABG during initial event consistent with hypoventilation
   (contributors include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if
   he received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he
   continues to have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of
   pressure support.  otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with
   volume overload, no frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less
   likely given therapeutic INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of
   aspiration per wife.
   - gentle diuresis, lasix 20mg iv x 1 now, goal -500cc tonight.
   - wean CPAP as tolerated, try [**3-21**] now, and re-gas in 30min.
   - avoid sedating medications.
   .
   # hypotension - normotensive presently, off pressors since early this
   morning.   no frank evidence of sepsis presently (lactate 0.7,
   leukocytosis improving without antibiotics, LFTs wnl).  cardiology does
   not feel that hypotension is [**12-19**] decreased EF.  ECG without STE.  ddx
   also includes hypovolemia, though grossly anasaric, his HCT has trended
   down to 24, but responded to 2U PRBC today.
   - check blood, urine cultures, repeat stool for cdiff.
   - check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim, given chronic prednisone dosing.
   - cycle cardiac enzymes overnight per cardiology, would consider
   stopping in AM if not bumping.
   - repeat ECG in AM.
   - f/u HCT in AM, maintain T&S, guaic stools.  stump c/d/i.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis - GAP = 12, albumin = 3.0.  lactate wnl.  received
   NaHCO3 x 1 today.  has chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly [**12-19**]
   myopathy, though unclear.  ddx also include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**]
   diarrhea, though not significant presently, and volume resuscitation
   given elevated chloride, though difficult to document exactly how much
   fluid pt has received.
   - infectious w/u as above, follow stool output.
   - was breifly on insulin gtt in ICU, but fsbs well controlled now, f/u
   UA for ketones.
   .
   # anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   - trend HCT Q12HR for now, maintain T&S, guaic stools.
   .
   # leukocytosis - no clear evidence of infection presently, resolving
   without antibiotics.  did have fever 101.8 post-op on [**10-24**], though
   unclear if he has had recurrence.
   # PVD s/p L BKA - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - prn ultram and dilaudid for pain.
   .
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.  unclear why he is not on an ACE.
   - cycle CE overnight x 1 more, f/u ECG in AM.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   .
   # atrial fibrillation - rate controlled presently with amiodarone and
   metoprolol, and now therapeutic on coumadin.  will need outpt
   cardiology f/u.
   - was on metoprolol 50 qdaily previously, now on 6.25 [**Hospital1 7**] with amio,
   titrate as needed.
   .
   # systolic CHF - volume up.
   - diurese as above, follow lytes.
   - daily weights.
   .
   # myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] - no evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts
   heads, takes deep breath).  on cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.
   cellcept was previously held, but resumed during last admission to
   [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with pt's neurologist.
   - continue prednisone.
   - d/w neurology resuming cellcept.
   .
   # HTN - SBPs stable presently, weaned of neo gtt quickly after
   hypertensive episode.
   - continue metoprolol with hold parameters.
   .
   # GERD - continue famotidine.
   # hypothyroidism - continue synthroid.
   .
   # DM2 - covered with insulin gtt in SICU.
   - cover with SSI.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, likely extubation in AM.
   # Prophylaxis: therapeutic on coumadin presently.
   # Access: PIV x 1, port-a-cath.
   # Code:  FULL
   # Communication: Patient, wife.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted on October 18th for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He underwent intubation and received transient pressor support on October 27th.
- The patient has chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly related to myopathy or medication use. He also has a history of chronic disease anemia, receiving chronic blood transfusions.
- The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hypotension (not in shock), impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/54 mmHg to 145/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O. His fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%, and respiratory system compliance is normal.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and there are no signs of intracranial hemorrhage or herniation on the CT head.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted on 10/18 for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA).
- He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB) after undergoing direct current cardioversion (DCCV).
- The patient experienced hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to intubation and transient pressor support on 10/27.
- He has chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to myopathy, though unclear.
- The patient's wound site culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to zosyn but sensitive to cefepime, meropenem, and ceftaz.
- He also has leukocytosis without clear evidence of infection, resolving without antibiotics.
- The patient's HCT trended down to 24, and he received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- He has anemia, possibly due to chronic disease, and receives chronic blood transfusions.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending.
- He is currently receiving multiple medications, including phenylephrine, sodium bicarbonate, flowsheets data, and other ICU medications.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 129/54 mmHg,"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA) with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB) after direct current cardioversion (DCCV), hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent intubation and transient pressor support on 10/27. He has chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to myopathy, though unclear. The patient also has chronic disease anemia, possibly related to chronic blood transfusions as per wife. He is on Procrit as an outpatient. No evidence of hemolysis based on total bilirubin. The patient's leukocytosis is resolving without antibiotics. He has erythema and warmth consistent with cellulitis at the surgical site, with purulent drainage from the wound. The swab from the wound grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to zosyn, sensitive to cefepime, meropenem, and ceftazidime. The patient also has hypotension, possibly due to volume depletion, though grossly anasarca with a hematocrit trend down to 24. He responded to 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) today. The patient's respiratory failure is due to hypoventilation, possibly caused by myopathy and medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation. He continues to have"

","The patient's progress note indicates that they are a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (R LE BKA), with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB) after direct current cardioversion (DCCV), hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent intubation and received transient pressor support. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 149/62 mmHg to 97/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 thousand/mm³, decreased hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 154 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted on [**10-18**] for right lower extremity below-knee amputation due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after discharge from the cath lab following a decompression. He had a history of chronic metabolic alkalosis, hypotension, acute respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient's current condition includes renal failure, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, which is characterized by a decrease in kidney function. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and accumulation of waste products in the body.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and he is experiencing hallucinations. This could be due to various factors such as medication side effects, infection, or complications from the amputation surgery.
3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient has an alteration in nutrition, which may be related to impaired swallowing and digestion issues. Proper nutrition is crucial for wound healing and overall recovery.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient had acute respiratory failure initially, and although he was extubated on [**10-29**], there is still a concern for ongoing respiratory issues. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation are essential for his recovery.

   volume overload, no frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less
   likely given therapeutic INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of
   aspiration per wife and pt is handing his secretions effectively.
   Currently most likely are myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] vs. statin induced
   myopathy.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient has a history of renal failure, altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hypertension, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's current condition indicates that they are still experiencing some degree of hypoventilation despite pressure support, and there is a concern for myasthenia gravis or statin-induced myopathy.

The patient's recent events include invasive ventilation being stopped, lower urine output overnight, and being given a fluid bolus. The patient's culture results show the presence of gram-negative rods, and the gram stain revealed 3+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, hydrocodone, sulfa, Haldol, Vicodin, morphine, atorvastatin, and statins. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature - 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate - 70 bpm (normal range 54-92 bpm), blood pressure - 149/71 mmHg (with a previous range of 104/38-166/74 mmHg), respiratory rate - 17 breaths per minute (normal range 9-22 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation - 99%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and impaired kidney function"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male who underwent bilateral below-knee amputations and was transferred from the CVICU to the MICU. He experienced an episode of hypotension earlier in his stay, which responded to defibrillation for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient is currently in the ICU with hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's chief complaint is bilateral below-knee amputations. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, rash from hydrocodone, hallucinations from sulfa, unknown reactions to Haldol, Vicodin, and morphine, and myopathy from atorvastatin.

The patient was extubated yesterday and is doing well. He has been receiving invasive ventilation, but it has been stopped. The patient was given amiodarone for bradycardia, but it is currently held. He is still confused and has an elevated INR. The patient's arterial line, indwelling port, and central venous catheter were inserted on 10/27/2197.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/56 mmHg to 166/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's blood glucose"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted on 10/18 for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post-defibrillator placement, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and received transient pressor support. He was extubated on 10/29 and is now on non-invasive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure, acute (acute kidney injury)
2. Altered mental status (not delirium)
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not acute respiratory distress syndrome)
4. Hypoxemia
5. Hypotension (not shock)
6. Atrial fibrillation

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal failure, acute (acute kidney injury) - ongoing monitoring of volume status, goal is to give 20mg IV lasix now.
2. Altered mental status (not delirium) - close monitoring, avoid sedating medications.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not acute respiratory distress syndrome) - continue with non-invasive ventilation, avoid hypoventilation.
4. Hypoxemia - continue with non-invasive ventilation.
5. Hypotension (not shock) - responded to 2U PRBC today.
6. Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol, therapeutic on coumadin."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted on 10/18 for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (R LE BKA) with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) status post direct current cardioversion (DCCV), hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was intubated and received transient pressor support. The patient continues to experience some degree of hypoventilation despite receiving 15cm of pressure support. His chest X-ray shows low lung volumes, bilateral pleural effusions, and alveolar infiltrates, suggesting fluid overload. There is no evidence of pneumonia. The patient has a chronic metabolic alkalosis with an unclear cause. He has leukocytosis resolving without antibiotics, hypotension, and anemia of chronic disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
2. Altered mental status (not delirium)
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
4. Hypoxemia
5. Hypotension (not in shock)
6. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB)

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of bilateral below-knee amputations (BKA). The patient has experienced several medical complications, including respiratory failure, renal failure, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation.

Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation but was extubated two days ago. However, he continues to require non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) intermittently due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is not tolerating any worsening respiratory acidosis, so some bicarbonate will be given back in amp form, and diuresis will be administered to address evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray.

Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis appears to be ongoing despite previous efforts to resolve it. Further interventions will be necessary to manage this condition.

Septic Shock: The patient was previously on vasopressors but is now off them. He has been receiving vancomycin and meropenem, but the pseudomonas from the wound is resistant to meropenem. Therefore, cefepime will be started as an alternative antibiotic.

Confusion: The patient remains confused, and further assessment and management are needed to address this issue.

Elevated INR: The patient's INR is down, but"

 SPUTUM CULTURE - At [**2197-11-1**] 02:45 AM
 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**2197-11-1**] 06:29 AM
   - Vascular surgery said 14 days until staples removed, ~30 days until
   granulation tissue visible so no concern at this time for non-healing.
   Also, ok to start Plavix/ASA from their standpoint.
   - Neuro c/s: will attempt to contact the patient's primary neurologist
   to help determine a course of treatment for this patient. At this
   point, it is very difficult to know whether worsening of the patient's
   underlying neuromuscular process is contributing to his hypercarbia.
   Recommend additional work-up of encephalopathy (LP, EEG, ct head), if
   the patient's respiratory status is not clearly contributing. continue
   the cellcept at 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and do not recommendd any additional Rx of
   the neuromuscular syndrome.
   - Volume status: I&O check at 2300 showed + 964 for last 24 hours, so
   an additional 40mg IV Lasix given.
   - ID: changed abx from Meropenem to Cefepime given wound cultures
   showing resistance to [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Metabolic acidosis: Urine lytes and urine pH were sent to help eval
   for RTA. Urine pH = 5.0. Urine anion gap (Urine [Na 101 + K 14 - Cl
   130]) = -15.
   - Respiratory acidosis: The pt was intubated over night.  Yesterday,
   the pt was maintained on BiPap in the AM, but was transitioned to face
   mask in the evening [**12-19**] concern for facial skin breakdown.  Repeat
   gases were obtained, and the pt maintained o2sats above 95% until just
   before 2am. At that time, the pt was began de-sating to the 80s with
   difficulty regaining his sats, even when placed on 95% high flow neb.
   He was intubated at that time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted on [**10-18**] for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA), with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) post-dccvx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent intubation and received transient pressor support. Since admission, the patient has experienced several complications, including relative hypothermia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, and hypoxemia.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. Despite this, he continues to have some degree of hypoventilation.
- Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output.
- Altered mental status: The patient is not fully awake and does not follow commands.
- Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a wound infection at the site of his amputation, which is showing signs of cellulitis and purulent drainage. The wound culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to meropenem but sensitive to cefepime.
- Hypotension: The patient was previously hypotensive but is now normotensive and off pressors. No evidence of se"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 SPUTUM CULTURE - At [**2197-11-1**] 02:45 AM
 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**2197-11-1**] 06:29 AM
   - Vascular surgery said 14 days until staples removed, ~30 days until
   granulation tissue visible so no concern at this time for non-healing.
   Also, ok to start Plavix/ASA from their standpoint.
   - Neuro c/s: will attempt to contact the patient's primary neurologist
   to help determine a course of treatment for this patient. At this
   point, it is very difficult to know whether worsening of the patient's
   underlying neuromuscular process is contributing to his hypercarbia.
   Recommend additional work-up of encephalopathy (LP, EEG, ct head), if
   the patient's respiratory status is not clearly contributing. continue
   the cellcept at 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and do not recommendd any additional Rx of
   the neuromuscular syndrome.
   - Volume status: I&O check at 2300 showed + 964 for last 24 hours, so
   an additional 40mg IV Lasix given.
   - ID: changed abx from Meropenem to Cefepime given wound cultures
   showing resistance to [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Metabolic acidosis: Urine lytes and urine pH were sent to help eval
   for RTA. Urine pH = 5.0. Urine anion gap (Urine [Na 101 + K 14 - Cl
   130]) = -15.
   - Respiratory acidosis: The pt was intubated over night.  Yesterday,
   the pt was maintained on BiPap in the AM, but was transitioned to face
   mask in the evening [**12-19**] concern for facial skin breakdown.  Repeat
   gases were obtained, and the pt maintained o2sats above 95% until just
   before 2am. At that time, the pt was began de-sating to the 80s with
   difficulty regaining his sats, even when placed on 95% high [**Last Name (un) **] neb. He
   was intubated at that time.
   - 1 amp of bicarb given.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (R LE BKA). He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) post-dccvx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated on 10/27, extubated on 10/29, and reintubated due to hypoventilation and respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Acidosis, mixed: The patient has a chronic metabolic alkalosis with superimposed respiratory acidosis.
2. Renal failure, acute: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated serum creatinine level.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is alert but slow to respond to questions.
4. Alteration in nutrition: The patient is NPO due to difficulties with swallowing.
5. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, requiring mechanical ventilation.
6. Hypoxemia: The patient has low oxygen saturation levels.
7. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive but has now stabilized.
8. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has erythema and warmth in the right lower extremity with purulent drainage from the surgical site, indicating a potential infection.
9. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is irregular due to atrial"

   24 Hour Events:
 SPUTUM CULTURE - At [**2197-11-1**] 02:45 AM
 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**2197-11-1**] 06:29 AM
   - Vascular surgery said 14 days until staples removed, ~30 days until
   granulation tissue visible so no concern at this time for non-healing.
   Also, ok to start Plavix/ASA from their standpoint.
   - Neuro c/s: will attempt to contact the patient's primary neurologist
   to help determine a course of treatment for this patient. At this
   point, it is very difficult to know whether worsening of the patient's
   underlying neuromuscular process is contributing to his hypercarbia.
   Recommend additional work-up of encephalopathy (LP, EEG, ct head), if
   the patient's respiratory status is not clearly contributing. continue
   the cellcept at 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and do not recommendd any additional Rx of
   the neuromuscular syndrome.
   - Volume status: I&O check at 2300 showed + 964 for last 24 hours, so
   an additional 40mg IV Lasix given.
   - ID: changed abx from Meropenem to Cefepime given wound cultures
   showing resistance to [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Metabolic acidosis: Urine lytes and urine pH were sent to help eval
   for RTA. Urine pH = 5.0. Urine anion gap (Urine [Na 101 + K 14 - Cl
   130]) = -15.
   - Respiratory acidosis: The pt was intubated over night.  Yesterday,
   the pt was maintained on BiPap in the AM, but was transitioned to face
   mask in the evening [**12-19**] concern for facial skin breakdown.  Repeat
   gases were obtained, and the pt maintained o2sats above 95% until just
   before 2am. At that time, the pt was began de-sating to the 80s with
   difficulty regaining his sats, even when placed on 95% high flow neb.
   He was intubated at that time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted on [**10-18**] for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (R LE BKA). He had a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) after direct current cardioversion (DCCV) and hypotension. The patient's respiratory failure was initially attributed to hypercarbic respiratory failure, but further evaluation revealed mixed acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. The patient also had anemia of chronic disease, leukocytosis, and a chronic metabolic alkalosis. He underwent R LE BKA due to peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a post-operative wound infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was resistant to meropenem but sensitive to cefepime. The patient's wound culture showed resistance to meropenem and sensitivity to cefepime. He was treated with cefepime and vancomycin. The patient also had a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), myasthenia gravis (MG), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was on various medications including aspirin, Plavix, Cellcept, prednisone, amiodarone, metoprolol, heparin, and Lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had acute respiratory failure due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. However, further evaluation"

   24 Hour Events:
 SPUTUM CULTURE - At [**2197-11-1**] 02:45 AM
 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**2197-11-1**] 06:29 AM
   - Vascular surgery said 14 days until staples removed, ~30 days until
   granulation tissue visible so no concern at this time for non-healing.
   Also, ok to start Plavix/ASA from their standpoint.
   - Neuro c/s: will attempt to contact the patient's primary neurologist
   to help determine a course of treatment for this patient. At this
   point, it is very difficult to know whether worsening of the patient's
   underlying neuromuscular process is contributing to his hypercarbia.
   Recommend additional work-up of encephalopathy (LP, EEG, ct head), if
   the patient's respiratory status is not clearly contributing. continue
   the cellcept at 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and do not recommendd any additional Rx of
   the neuromuscular syndrome.
   - Volume status: I&O check at 2300 showed + 964 for last 24 hours, so
   an additional 40mg IV Lasix given.
   - ID: changed abx from Meropenem to Cefepime given wound cultures
   showing resistance to [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Metabolic acidosis: Urine lytes and urine pH were sent to help eval
   for RTA. Urine pH = 5.0. Urine anion gap (Urine [Na 101 + K 14 - Cl

   - Respiratory acidosis: The pt was intubated over night.  Yesterday,
   the pt was maintained on BiPap in the AM, but was transitioned to face
   mask in the evening [**12-19**] concern for facial skin breakdown.  Repeat
   gases were obtained, and the pt maintained o2sats above 95% until just
   before 2am. At that time, the pt was began de-sating to the 80s with
   difficulty regaining his sats, even when placed on 95% high flow neb.
   He was intubated at that time.

- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is on aspirin and clopidogrel (plavix).
- The patient has systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with evidence of volume overload.
- The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with episodes of desaturation and hypercarbia.
- The patient's neurologic status is altered, with difficulty following commands and grimacing to painful stimuli.
- The patient's renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL.
- The patient has impaired skin integrity with erythema and warmth at the surgical site, suggestive of cellulitis.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with a rate-controlled status using amiodarone and metoprolol.
- The patient's arterial line was stopped on [**2197-11-1**] 06:29 AM.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with episodes of desaturation and hypercarbia, indicating ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, fever post-op, and wound infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can lead to sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient has impaired renal function with elevated creatinine levels, indicating the possibility of acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, which can be caused by sepsis, volume depletion, or medications.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis with an anion gap, which may be due to lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, or renal failure.
6. Myasthenic crisis: The patient has myasthenia gravis and altered mental status, which can progress to myasthenic crisis.
7. Systolic congestive heart failure: The patient's systolic CHF may worsen due to volume overload and impaired cardiac function.
8. Wound infection: The patient's surgical site is infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can lead to wound dehiscence and further complications.

 responded
   to DCCV.  Back in ICU with hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.  Now reintubated with recurrent hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.
   1. Respiratory Failure: Now reintubated - likely that pCO2 of 40 is a
   level he cannot achieve.  CXR improved with diuresis.  Improvement in
   metabolic acidosis will allow him to breathe at higher pCO2.  Cont
   CellCept and baseline prednisone - appreciate neuro input.
   2. Metabolic acidosis: Looked to be resolving yesterday but actually
   ongoing
   3. Septic shock:  Off pressors.  But mildly hypothermic today - will
   resend blood cultures.  Has been on vanc/cefepime.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male who has undergone bilateral below-knee amputation (BKA) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). He has a history of penicillin allergy, as well as known reactions to hydrocodone, sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), Haldol (haloperidol lactate), Vicodin (hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen), morphine, atorvastatin, and statins-HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, requiring reintubation due to persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure and secretions from the endotracheal tube (ETT). He is sedated and unable to provide a medical history. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 64 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 135/57mmHg to 184/89mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

The patient's recent events include a reintubation at 02:45 AM on [date], cessation of arterial line at 06:29 AM on [date], and various medication administration times.

The patient's allergies are documented, including penicillins, hydrocodone, sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to intubation. The patient also has chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to myopathy, chronic disease anemia, leukocytosis, and a history of diabetes mellitus type 2.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Renal failure, acute (acute kidney injury): The patient has a decreased glomerular filtration rate and elevated serum creatinine levels.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved, but he still requires close monitoring. Avoidance of sedating medications is recommended.

3. Alteration in nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds with a free water flush every 6 hours.

4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure and requires ventilation support. The goal is to maintain a PCO2 level of 50 to help retain bicarbonate due to acidosis.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 98% with the use of supplemental oxygen.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits and off pressors since early morning. The cause of hypotension is unclear, but possible causes include hypovolem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and hypotension after undergoing right lower extremity below-knee amputation. The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure, altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation.

Medical Complications:
1. Acidosis, mixed: The patient has a history of metabolic alkalosis and chronic respiratory acidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the acidosis.
2. Renal failure, acute: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, as indicated by a decrease in hemoglobin concentration and platelet count. Fluid management and electrolyte balance should be closely monitored.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing confusion and disorientation. It is important to ensure adequate oxygenation and avoid sedating medications to improve his mental status.
4. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support due to hypoventilation and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are below normal, indicating inadequate oxygenation. Oxygen supplementation should be provided as needed.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he requires ongoing monitoring and management to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right below-knee amputation, with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was extubated on 10/29 but had to be reintubated on 10/31 due to recurrent respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions including mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and hypotension. The patient also has chronic metabolic alkalosis, possible myopathy, chronic disease anemia, resolving leukocytosis, and a history of diabetes mellitus type 2.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/39 to 69/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressures support.

The patient's physical examination shows clear lung sounds bilaterally, distended abdomen with soft and non-tender bowel sounds, and no evidence of edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, normal potassium levels, and elevated blood glucose level.

The patient's imaging shows improved pulmonary edema but still exhibits large bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, following bilateral below-knee amputation (BKA). The patient has been unresponsive at times, with transient hypotension overnight that responded to fluid bolus administration. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Other medical conditions include acute renal failure, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypoxemia, hypotension (not in shock), impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Proper measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls should be implemented to prevent VAP.
2. Renal Failure: Acute renal failure may worsen if the patient's renal function does not improve. Monitoring urine output and adjusting fluid and medication administration accordingly is crucial.
3. Skin Integrity: Impaired skin integrity due to immobility and pressure can increase the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and proper skin care are essential to prevent further complications.
4. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system, there is an increased risk of infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: Hypotension and atrial fibrillation indicate potential cardiovascular issues. Continuous monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male who underwent bilateral below-knee amputations (BKA) and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure.
- The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He required reintubation.
- He is currently receiving IVIG and is being monitored for any changes in WBC count.
- Metabolic acidosis has resolved, but the patient remains at high risk for septic shock. Antibiotics (vanc/cefepime) are being continued.
- The patient's mental status is somnolent, and he is being closely monitored.
- Elevated INR is being managed with Coumadin and subcutaneous heparin until therapeutic levels are achieved.
- The patient previously experienced a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and is being treated with amiodarone.
- Other issues are being managed by the ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have intermittent elevated pCO2 and negative inspiratory force (NIF) in teens. IVIG therapy is ongoing, and extubation will be delayed until its effects are observed.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: This condition has now resolved.
3. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient is at risk for septic shock and is being treated with appropriate antibiotics. Transient hypotension"

   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb, given acidosis
   - S/p 1 dose of IVIG (today day [**1-19**])

   - Hypotension yesterday could be due to over-diuresis, IVIG reaction or
   sepsis.  Pt without fevers, cultures from [**11-1**] pending, will follow.
   Less likely is occult bleeding, although pt
s HCT has been trending

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA) with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient has been experiencing recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypoventilation, and hypotension. 

The patient's current medications include home prednisone, Cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil), levothyroxine, aspirin, and Plavix. The patient is also receiving IVIG, antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime), and has had blood and urine cultures taken. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as low calcium and magnesium levels. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating. 

The patient's physical examination reveals minimal agitation, grimacing to pain, regular heart rhythm, clear lung sounds bilaterally, and soft abdomen without tenderness or rebound. The patient's extremities show no edema, but the surgical sites appear dusky without erythema. 

The patient's imaging shows mild improvement of right basilar opacity on chest X-ray, and no collection identified within the superficial tissues at the site of interest on the right BKA stump on ultrasound. 

The patient's assessment and plan include close monitoring of volume status,"

1. Acute renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is intermittently responsive and follows commands only occasionally. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, medication effects, or underlying neurological conditions.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has experienced recurrent episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is characterized by high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This may be related to myopathy, medication use, or other respiratory issues.

4. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of low blood pressure, which could be due to over-diuresis, IVIG reaction, sepsis, or other causes.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which rate control medications like amiodarone and metoprolol are being used.

6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has chronic metabolic alkalosis and an altered anion gap, indicating an acid-base imbalance.

7. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

   - Neuro: Ativan at bedside, unsure if seizure but will look at EEG
   - EEG:  symmetric, slow, biphasic waves of low amplitude, classic
   textbook, may be status masked by hepatic encephalopathy vs. hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Ordering ammonia, LFTs, was going to give 2mg IV
   Ativan x1 and observe for 30-40 minutes for improvement of myoclonus.
   However, when patient was evaluated prior to Ativan, myoclonic jerks
   still present but markedly improved, decided to hold on Ativan and
   repeat EEG tomorrow AM again.  Discussed w/ Neuro.
   - Increased twitching at 3am, given 2mg Ativan and twitching resolved

   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb, given acidosis
   - S/p 1 dose of IVIG (today day [**1-19**])
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - given pt
s decr mental status as well as CO2 retention on VBG this AM
   64, not at goal), will likely not attempt extubation today.
   - will do an SBT pending mental status with pre and post-ABGs.

   # hypotension/relative hypothermia - normotensive presently, off
   pressors since early this morning.   no frank evidence of sepsis
   presently (lactate 0.7, leukocytosis improving without antibiotics,
   LFTs wnl).  cardiology does not feel that hypotension is [**12-19**] decreased
   EF.  ECG without STE.  ddx also includes hypovolemia, though grossly
   anasaric, his HCT has trended down to 24, but responded to 2U PRBC
   today.  R LE shows erythema/warmth c/w cellulitis and has purulent
   drainage from site.  Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas resistant to
   zosyn, sensitive to cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Currently on
   Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Hypotension yesterday could be due to over-diuresis, IVIG reaction or
   sepsis.  Pt without fevers, cultures from [**11-1**] pending, will follow.
   Less likely is occult bleeding, although pt
s HCT has been trending
   down over last 5 days, his baseline is 25-30 over last year, so pt is
   at baseline. ? hemoconcentration earlier in week w. HCT 40.  Pt was
   pre-treated prior to IVIG but will closely monitor pt before today
   treatment.  Most likely etiology at this time is over-diuresis.
   - On home prednisone 5mg daily.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - IVIG today (day [**1-19**])
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4; re-check level given

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted on [**10-18**] for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA) with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) status post direct current cardioversion (DCCV), hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was initially extubated on [**10-27**] but required reintubation on [**10-31**] due to recurrent respiratory failure.

The patient has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission with no known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's ABG during initial event was consistent with hypoventilation, possibly due to myopathy and medications. Currently, the patient continues to have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15 cm of pressure support. The patient's chest X-ray and exam are consistent with volume overload, without evidence of pneumonia. The most likely etiology at this time is statin-induced myopathy. The patient was extubated on [**10-29**] but required re-intubation on [**11-1**] for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 80/34 mmHg (45/59), respiratory rate of 12 breaths"

   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low

   - Hypotension yesterday could be due to over-diuresis, IVIG reaction or
   sepsis.  Pt without fevers, cultures from [**11-1**] pending, will follow.
   Less likely is occult bleeding, although pt

   down over last 5 days, his baseline is 25-30 over last year, so pt is
   at baseline. ? hemoconcentration earlier in week w. HCT 40.  Pt was
   pre-treated prior to IVIG but will closely monitor pt before today
   treatment.  Most likely etiology at this time is over-diuresis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA) due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was extubated on 10/27 but had to be reintubated on 10/31 due to recurrent respiratory failure. The patient continues to have some degree of hypoventilation despite receiving pressure support. There is a concern for statin-induced myopathy. The patient has chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly related to bicarbonate loss or diarrhea, and volume resuscitation due to elevated chloride. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with myoclonic jerks and a likely seizure. An EEG is pending to clarify the situation. The patient has a history of chronic disease anemia, leukocytosis without evidence of infection, and possible pseudomonas infection at the surgical site. The patient's wound also grew VRE. The patient's cardiac history includes AFib, controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol, and therapeutic on Coumadin. The patient has hypernatremia, possibly related to chronic metabolic alkalosis or bicarbonate loss. There are multiple other medical issues and medications being managed in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old individual who underwent bilateral below-knee amputation (BKA) and is currently experiencing post-operative respiratory failure. The patient has been having recurrent myoclonic jerks, which were initially unresponsive to lorazepam but showed improvement with ativan. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, hydrocodone, sulfa, haldol, Vicodin, morphine, statins, and unknown reactions to certain medications. The patient received vancomycin and cefepime on [2197-11-4] and [2197-11-5], respectively.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/40-159/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is currently 102.5 kg, and height is 70 inches. The patient has been receiving prophylactic heparin sodium, famotidine, lorazepam, and other ICU medications.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of 4,784 mL total in, 2,046 mL PO, 1,691 mL IVF, 516 mL blood products, and 1,560 mL urine output with a total out of 1,560 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, tidal volume of 415 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 17 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 69, and arterial blood gas (ABG) of /26.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal pupils, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and no skin abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no myoclonic jerks. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 158 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.4 g/dL, potassium (K+) of 5.3 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 141 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 28.0%, glucose of 172 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include multiple problems such as acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, acute respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). Seizures are suspected due to myoclonic jerks, and a head CT will be obtained. Myopathy management involves continuing cellcept and steroids. Stump infection is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may indicate delirium or another form of cognitive impairment. This can result in disorientation, confusion, and potential falls or self-harm.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or acute respiratory acidosis if not adequately managed.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels may indicate inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues, leading to tissue hypoxia and potential organ damage.
5. Hypotension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure readings suggest potential hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of shock.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to pressure ulcers, infections, and compromised wound healing.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can result in irregular heart rhythm, reduced cardiac output, and an increased risk of embolic events.

These potential medical complications should be closely monitored and managed to optimize the patient's outcome and prevent further deterioration."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA) due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) post-dccvx, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was extubated on 10/29 but had to be reintubated on 11/1 for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient continues to have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15 cm of pressure support. The patient has a chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to myopathy, though unclear. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with somnolence and myoclonic jerks. There are concerns about seizures, and the patient has been given Ativan and Keppra as per neurology recommendations. The patient has an elevated PTT, which is uncertain why it increased from 50 s to 150 s over the last 24 hours without any apparent cause. The patient's hypotension is likely due to over-diuresis, IVIG reaction, or sepsis. The patient has a wound infection with Pseudomonas at the site of R LE BKA, resistant to meropenem, sensitive to cefepime. The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol, and now therapeutic on coumadin. The patient's hypernatrem"

   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical issues and complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly due to myopathy and medication effects. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Renal failure: The patient is reported to have acute renal failure, which can be caused by various factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or volume overload.

3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which may be attributed to over-diuresis, IVIG reaction, sepsis, or occult bleeding.

4. Mental status changes: The patient has had altered mental status and myoclonic jerks, raising concerns about seizures or delirium. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

5. Infection: The patient has a wound infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to some antibiotics but sensitive to cefepime. There is also a concern for Clostridium difficile infection, but the test result was negative.

6. Cardiac issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation, for which rate control medications like amiodarone and metoprolol are being used. There is also a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), for which aspirin and Plavix are prescribed.

7. Metabolic acidosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent below-knee amputation (BKA). He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure post-op and has experienced seizure activity. The patient has been started on Keppra and given Ativan for myoclonic jerks. His medical allergies include penicillins, hydrocodone, sulfa, Haldol, Vicodin, morphine, and statins. The patient is also on various medications such as prednisone, Cellcept, IVIG, tamsulosin, heparin sodium, famotidine, lorazepam, gabapentin, Effexor, and Pepcid.

24-hour events include the administration of cefepime and vancomycin, as well as the insertion of an indwelling port.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/53 mmHg to 134/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 93.2 kg at admission to 102.5 kg currently.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, with warm skin and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurological assessment indicates unresponsiveness and no movement or tone assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose, and troponin-T. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several medical problems, including acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, acute respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, and seizures. The patient is still experiencing myoclonus and active seizures, for which Keppra has been started. The BKA infection is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. Coagulopathy is present with increased PTT, and efforts are being made to obtain a PTT from another venipuncture source. Heparin and coumadin have been held. Respiratory failure has prevented weaning from the ventilator due to ongoing seizures. The patient's nutritional support includes Impact with Fiber at 55 mL/hour. Prophylactic measures include DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro: load with 1.8g (20mg/kg) Keppra IV, then start keppra 1000mg
   tonight for maintenance. Ativan prn szr activity. - Consider LP and MRI
   to look for source of seizures. Then loaded IV fosphenytoin for
   seizures. Pt became hypotensive (to 50s) during loading, so loading had
   to be dc'ed.
   - Family meeting: be sure to discuss any changes to patient's
   management with his wife (including medication changes) as she is very
   concerned that medication sensitivity is what led to his current
   situation.
   - In the evening, pt de-sat'ed to high 80s, came up to >95% with 50%
   FiO2 (increased from 40%). Got a CXR (c/w fluid overload, relatively
   unchanged from prior), and gave lasix 20mg IV x1, as patient was
   positive for the day.
   - Attempted to place A-line, unsuccessfully.
   - Unable to do MRI [**12-19**] EEG electrodes on pt's head--will need to be
   removed by EEG tech today.
   - Started Acyclovir as empiric HSV encephalitis coverage.
   - Plan for LP this AM. Pt is receiving 2U FFP to reverse INR.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - s/p 5 day course of IVIG (last day [**11-6**])
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - given pt
s altered mental status and overall worse clinical status,
   will not extubate today; continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   .
   # Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per Neuro recs for
   myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms (although pt very
   somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG showed runs of rhythmic
   activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures, increasingly organizing
   throughout the day.  Neurology recommended initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with
   maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24 hour EEG monitoring to see
   if medications are adequately controlling the pt
s seizures.
   - Continuing Vanc/Cefepime; discontinuing Acyclovir (which was started
   overnight [**11-6**], but on further discussion likelihood of HSV is very
   low, and risks of adding another medication outweighs the benefits,
   given Mr. [**Known lastname 12073**]
s extreme sensitivity to medications).
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose
   - Maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Ativan prn seizure activity, but try to minimize use of sedating
   medication
   - Per neuro recs, loaded pt with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin overnight
   (Goal: 1800mg), however, due to profound hypotension with SBPs in 50s
   requiring transient pressor support, pt only received 900mg.  Will
   start Phenytoin 100mgQ 8 hours, but use PO dosing to reduce likelihood
   of hypotension.
   - f/u final results of 24 hour EEG
   - Plan for MRI brain today, after non-MRI compatible EEG electrodes
   removed, to evaluate for CVA, infection, or other epileptogenic focus.
   - Plan for LP today, after INR reversed with FFP
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Given that pt is now therapeutic on coumadin,
   will discontinue heparin SQ.
   - PM PTT today
   - Discontinue heparin SQ.
   - pneumoboots
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt
s platelets have trended down from 600s to low
   100s today.  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI), but will also evaluate for
   HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high risk for HIT given timing of
   drop in platelets, clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the
   past. He has no known thrombosis
although pt does have AMS and we plan
   to evaluate for CVA with MRI.
   - Send HIT antibodies
   - Discontinue all Heparin products
heparin SQ, and heparin flushes
   .
   # Hypotension - Pt
s hypotension overnight ([**Date range (1) 12291**]) likely due to
   medication effects, given that pt was recent loaded on Keppra,
   Fosphenytoin and received
   - On home prednisone 5mg daily.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG today (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture. C. diff was negative.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; check Vanco level today and dose again per Rx
   - vascular sx following
   .
   # PVD s/p R BKA. Most recent wound cxr growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]),
   resistant to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc; check trough today and redose.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix.
   - vascular following
   .
   # Mental Status:  Monitor. Avoid sedation.  More somnolent [**11-4**] with
   myoclonic jerks.  Likely seizure, uncertain of cause.
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - plan for MRI and LP today
   - f/u 24 hr EEG monitoring report

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a course of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after dual-chamber cardioversion, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on 10/29 but had to be reintubated on 11/1 for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.

- The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, necrotizing myopathy, wound infection, and seizures. He is sedated and non-interactive, intubated in NAD, unresponsive to loud stimuli.

- The patient has a history of chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to myopathy, though unclear. Other possible etiologies include bicarbonate loss or diarrhea. He received NaHCO3 x 1 today.

- The patient's lab results show an elevated PTT likely due to use of Heparin in the setting of renal insufficiency. His platelets have trended down from 600s to low 100s today. He is also thrombocytopenic, with multiple possible etiologies including bone marrow suppression, drug adverse effect, or HIT.

- The patient has hypotension overnight, likely due to medication effects. He was recent loaded on Keppra, Fosphenytoin, and received 2U FFP to reverse INR.

   Chief Complaint: respiratory failure, necrotizing myopathy, wound
   infection, seizures
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro: load with 1.8g (20mg/kg) Keppra IV, then start keppra 1000mg
   tonight for maintenance. Ativan prn szr activity. - Consider LP and MRI
   to look for source of seizures. Then loaded IV fosphenytoin for
   seizures. Pt became hypotensive (to 50s) during loading, so loading had
   to be dc'ed.
   - Family meeting: be sure to discuss any changes to patient's
   management with his wife (including medication changes) as she is very
   concerned that medication sensitivity is what led to his current
   situation.
   - In the evening, pt de-sat'ed to high 80s, came up to >95% with 50%
   FiO2 (increased from 40%). Got a CXR (c/w fluid overload, relatively
   unchanged from prior), and gave lasix 20mg IV x1, as patient was
   positive for the day.
   - Attempted to place A-line, unsuccessfully.
   - Unable to do MRI [**12-19**] EEG electrodes on pt's head--will need to be
   removed by EEG tech today.
   - Started Acyclovir as empiric HSV encephalitis coverage.
   - Plan for LP this AM. Pt is receiving 2U FFP to reverse INR.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although

   # Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per Neuro recs for
   myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms (although pt very
   somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG showed runs of rhythmic
   activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures, increasingly organizing
   throughout the day.  Neurology recommended initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with
   maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24 hour EEG monitoring to see
   if medications are adequately controlling the pt
s seizures.
   - Continuing Vanc/Cefepime; discontinuing Acyclovir (which was started
   overnight [**11-6**], but on further discussion likelihood of HSV is very
   low, and risks of adding another medication outweighs the benefits,
   given Mr. [**Known lastname 12073**]
s extreme sensitivity to medications).
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose
   - Maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Ativan prn seizure activity, but try to minimize use of sedating
   medication
   - Per neuro recs, loaded pt with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin overnight
   (1800mg), however, due to hypotension, pt only received 900mg.  Will
   start Phenytoin 100mgQ 8 hours, but use PO dosing to reduce likelihood
   of hypotension.
   - f/u final results of 24 hour EEG
   - Plan for MRI brain today, after non-MRI compatible EEG electrodes
   removed, to evaluate for CVA, infection, or other epileptogenic focus.
   - Plan for LP today, after INR reversed with FFP
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Given that pt is now therapeutic on coumadin,
   will discontinue heparin SQ.
   - PM PTT today
   - Discontinue heparin SQ.

   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI), but will also evaluate for
   HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high risk for HIT given timing of
   drop in platelets, clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the
   past. He has no known thrombosis
although pt does have AMS and we plan
   to evaluate for CVA with MRI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation. He initially presented with atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues, including necrotizing myopathy, wound infection, seizures, and thrombocytopenia. He has undergone several interventions, including administration of various medications, blood products, and procedures such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's previous episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Seizures: The patient has experienced myoclonic jerks and runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures. Continued monitoring and management of seizures are necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has trended down, indicating a potential risk of bleeding. Further evaluation and management are required to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Hypotension: The patient's overnight hypotension may be related to medication effects. Monitoring and adjustment of medications are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient's wound culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to"

   management with his wife (including medication changes) as she is very
   concerned that medication sensitivity is what led to his current
   situation.
   - In the evening, pt de-sat'ed to high 80s, came up to >95% with 50%
   FiO2 (increased from 40%). Got a CXR (c/w fluid overload, relatively
   unchanged from prior), and gave lasix 20mg IV x1, as patient was
   positive for the day.
   - Attempted to place A-line, unsuccessfully.
   - Unable to do MRI [**12-19**] EEG electrodes on pt's head--will need to be
   removed by EEG tech today.
   - Started Acyclovir as empiric HSV encephalitis coverage.
   - Plan for LP this AM. Pt is receiving 2U FFP to reverse INR.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.

   # Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per Neuro recs for
   myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms (although pt very
   somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG showed runs of rhythmic
   activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures, increasingly organizing
   throughout the day.  Neurology recommended initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with
   maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24 hour EEG monitoring to see
   if medications are adequately controlling the pt
s seizures.

   Disposition: ICU for now, pending improved respiratory status
","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted on 10/18 for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA) with a past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), status post direct current cardioversion (DCCV), hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was extubated on 10/29 but had to be reintubated on 10/31 due to recurrent respiratory failure.

The patient has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission, with no known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). An initial ABG showed hypoventilation, which could be attributed to his myopathy and medications, although it is unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation. Currently, the patient continues to have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.

The patient has been diagnosed with necrotizing myopathy, likely statin-induced, and has wound infection with purulent drainage from the site. The swab from the wound grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to meropenem but sensitive to cefepime. The patient is currently on vancomycin and cefepime.

Other notable issues include hypotension/relative hypothermia, myoclonic jerks, mental status changes, hypernatremia, anemia"

   Chief Complaint: respiratory failure, necrotizing myopathy, wound
   infection, seizures
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro: load with 1.8g (20mg/kg) Keppra IV, then start keppra 1000mg
   tonight for maintenance. Ativan prn szr activity. - Consider LP and MRI
   to look for source of seizures. Then loaded IV fosphenytoin for
   seizures. Pt became hypotensive (to 50s) during loading, so loading had
   to be dc'ed.
   - Family meeting: be sure to discuss any changes to patient's
   management with his wife (including medication changes) as she is very
   concerned that medication sensitivity is what led to his current
   situation.
   - In the evening, pt de-sat'ed to high 80s, came up to >95% with 50%
   FiO2 (increased from 40%). Got a CXR (c/w fluid overload, relatively
   unchanged from prior), and gave lasix 20mg IV x1, as patient was
   positive for the day.
   - Attempted to place A-line, unsuccessfully.
   - Unable to do MRI [**12-19**] EEG electrodes on pt's head--will need to be
   removed by EEG tech today.
   - Started Acyclovir as empiric HSV encephalitis coverage.
   - Plan for LP this AM. Pt is receiving 2U FFP to reverse INR.

   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin

   Disposition: ICU for now, pending improved respiratory status
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA), with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperthyroidism, and hepatitis C. He presented with respiratory failure, necrotizing myopathy, wound infection, and seizures. The patient's current condition includes mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure, acute hypoxemia, hypotension (not in shock), impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to repeated intubations. He continues to have some degree of hypoventilation despite pressure support.
2. Necrotizing Myopathy: The patient has a likely statin-induced necrotizing myopathy, which is causing his myoclonic jerks and seizures.
3. Wound Infection: The patient has an infected wound on his right lower extremity, which is showing signs of cellulitis and purulent drainage. The wound swab grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to meropenem but sensitive to cefepime.
4. Seizures: The patient has been experiencing seizures, and an EEG showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood"

   Chief Complaint: respiratory failure, necrotizing myopathy, wound
   infection, seizures
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro: load with 1.8g (20mg/kg) Keppra IV, then start keppra 1000mg
   tonight for maintenance. Ativan prn szr activity. - Consider LP and MRI
   to look for source of seizures. Then loaded IV fosphenytoin for
   seizures. Pt became hypotensive (to 50s) during loading, so loading had
   to be dc'ed.
   - Family meeting: be sure to discuss any changes to patient's
   management with his wife (including medication changes) as she is very
   concerned that medication sensitivity is what led to his current
   situation.
   - In the evening, pt de-sat'ed to high 80s, came up to >95% with 50%
   FiO2 (increased from 40%). Got a CXR (c/w fluid overload, relatively
   unchanged from prior), and gave lasix 20mg IV x1, as patient was
   positive for the day.
   - Attempted to place A-line, unsuccessfully.
   - Unable to do MRI [**12-19**] EEG electrodes on pt's head--will need to be
   removed by EEG tech today.
   - Started Acyclovir as empiric HSV encephalitis coverage.
   - Plan for LP this AM. Pt is receiving 2U FFP to reverse INR.

   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb, given acidosis
   - Continue IVIG (today day [**3-21**])
   - avoid sedating medications

   # Myoclonic Jerks:  Question of seizure based on EEG, but will clarify
   with neurology what was seen on the EEG.  Given 2mg Ativan overnight
   per Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms.
   Repeat 24 hour EEG showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of
   non-convulsive seizures, increasingly organizing throughout the day.
   Neurology recommended initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **]
   dose.
   - load with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose

   drainage from site.  Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas resistant to
   zosyn, sensitive to cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Currently on
   Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Hypotension yesterday could be due to over-diuresis, IVIG reaction or
   sepsis.  Pt without fevers, cultures from [**11-1**] pending, will follow.
   Less likely is occult bleeding, although pt
s HCT has been trending
   down over last 5 days, his baseline is 25-30 over last year, so pt is
   at baseline. ? hemoconcentration earlier in week w. HCT 40.  Pt was
   pre-treated prior to IVIG but will closely monitor pt before today
   treatment.  Most likely etiology at this time is over-diuresis.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation with postoperative complications. He was initially extubated but required reintubation due to recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic metabolic alkalosis, likely due to diuretic use or chronic renal disease. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, for which he was treated with direct current cardioversion.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, necrotizing myopathy, wound infection, and seizures. He has an elevated PTT and hypotension, which may be due to over-diuresis, IVIG reaction, or sepsis. The patient's mental status has declined, and he has myoclonic jerks, suggesting possible seizures. He also has anemia, chronic disease, leukocytosis, and hypernatremia.

The patient has several active problems, including hypotension/relative hypothermia, elevated PTT, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, myopathy, wound infection, and mental status changes. He also has stable issues such as chronic metabolic alkalosis and myasthenia gravis.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, and GERD. He is currently receiving multiple medications, including aspirin, Plavix"

   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - s/p 5 day course of IVIG (last day [**11-6**])
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - given pt
s altered mental status and overall worse clinical status,
   will not extubate today; continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   .
   # Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per Neuro recs for
   myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms (although pt very
   somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG showed runs of rhythmic
   activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures, increasingly organizing
   throughout the day.  Neurology recommended initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with
   maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24 hour EEG monitoring to see
   if medications are adequately controlling the pt
s seizures.
   - Continuing Vanc/Cefepime; discontinuing Acyclovir (which was started
   overnight [**11-6**], but on further discussion likelihood of HSV is very
   low, and risks of adding another medication outweighs the benefits,
   given Mr. [**Known lastname 12073**]
s extreme sensitivity to medications).
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose
   - Maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Ativan prn seizure activity, but try to minimize use of sedating
   medication
   - Per neuro recs, loaded pt with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin overnight
   (Goal: 1800mg), however, due to profound hypotension with SBPs in 50s
   requiring transient pressor support, pt only received 900mg.  Will
   start Phenytoin 100mgQ 8 hours, but use PO dosing to reduce likelihood
   of hypotension. Given Phenobarbital overnight.
   - f/u final results of 24 hour EEG
   - Plan for MRI brain today, after non-MRI compatible EEG electrodes
   removed, to evaluate for CVA, infection, or other epileptogenic focus.
   - f/u LP results
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Given that pt is now therapeutic on coumadin,
   will discontinue heparin SQ.
   - Discontinued heparin products
   - Pneumoboots
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt
s platelets have trended down from 600s to low
   100s today.  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI), but will also evaluate for
   HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high risk for HIT given timing of
   drop in platelets, clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the
   past. He has no known thrombosis
although pt does have AMS and we plan
   to evaluate for CVA with MRI.
   - Send HIT antibodies
   - Discontinued all Heparin products
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   - On home prednisone 5mg daily.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG today (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture. C. diff was negative.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; f/u Vanco level today and dose again per Rx
   .
   # PVD s/p R BKA. Most recent wound cxr growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]),
   resistant to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc; check trough today and redose.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He has a history of chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to myopathy, though unclear. Other past medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and has required mechanical ventilation. He also has acute kidney injury, anemia of chronic disease, leukocytosis with an elevated white blood cell count, and necrotizing myopathy with a history of myasthenia antibodies. The patient's current medications include cellcept, prednisone, IVIG, levothyroxine, aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, amiodarone, and coumadin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 100/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, BUN, potassium, and low levels of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions, scrotal edema, and pericardial effusion."

   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.

   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24

   effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI), but will also evaluate for
   HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high risk for HIT given timing of
   drop in platelets, clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the
   past. He has no known thrombosis

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted on 10/18 for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA) and diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). He experienced hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to intubation. The patient was extubated on 10/29 but had to be re-intubated on 11/1 for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure. His current conditions include hyperglycemia, mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and status epilepticus. The patient has a history of chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to myopathy, and is being treated with medications such as Keppra, phenobarbital, and phenytoin for seizures. He also has thrombocytopenia, possibly related to heparin use or bone marrow suppression, and anemia of chronic disease. The patient has undergone right BKA with a wound infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, resistant to meropenem but sensitive to cefepime. He is currently on cefepime and vancomycin. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is on aspirin and Plavix. He is also being treated for systolic congestive heart failure (CHF),"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of vasculopathy, post-operative course complicated by stump wound infection, respiratory failure due to myopathy, and status epilepticus. The patient has multiple allergies and is currently receiving various medications including antibiotics, pain relievers, and antipsychotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/42-130/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, tidal volume of 503-624 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%, and respiratory system compliance index of 55. The patient's blood gas analysis shows partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide within normal limits, pH at 7.23, bicarbonate level of 23 mEq/L, base excess of -3.5 mEq/L, and lactate level of 28.7%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals cervical lymphadenopathy, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds with diminished bases, presence of edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows the patient to be unresponsive with no assessed movement or"

   - stopped coumadin, given pt
s poor clinical status
   - per neuro: added on multiple CSF micro studies (HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein
   electrophoresis, beta-2 microglobulin)
   - also per neuro: loaded with phenobarbitol (slowly to avoid
   hypotension), then 1 hour post-load, check level - goal = 20-30; then
   start 50tid phenobarbital IV; continue on keppra and dilantin both;
   still with status epilepticus; neuro felt MRI pretty normal, so unclear
   etiology; if has visible convulsions through this regimen, change the
   phenobarb to a pentobarbitol drip
   -left stump looking more grey and with decreasing ease to doppler the

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs in response to lasix o/n x 2. Pt has anasarca and whole body fluid
   overload, but, given his low albumin and poor nutritional status (with
   resulting low oncotic pressure), maintaining intravascular volume will
   be difficult.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - s/p 5 day course of IVIG
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - given pt
s altered mental status, uncontrolled seizure activity and
   overall worse clinical status, will not extubate today;
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose; now on
   maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - s/p loading with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin (Goal: 1800mg) reaching
   Dilantin level of 5.5 (corrected for albumin to10.2 this AM.  Will
   continue Dilantin 100 mg PO/NG Q8H, following levels after every 3^rd
   dose.
   - s/p loading with phenobarbitol, post-loading level 21.6; started
   Phenobarbital 50mg IV TID, following levels after every 3^rd dose.
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt
s platelets have trended down from 600s to low
   100s today.  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI), but will also evaluate for
   HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high risk for HIT given timing of
   drop in platelets, clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the
   past. He has no known thrombosis
although pt does have AMS and we plan
   to evaluate for CVA with MRI.  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently off norepinephrine.
   - On home prednisone 5mg daily but will start patient on stress-dosed
   steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr).
   - Norepinephrine as needed for MAP >70
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far.
   - C. diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; f/u Vanco levels today and dose again per Rx
   .
   # PVD s/p R BKA. Most recent wound cxr growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]),
   resistant to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc; dosing based on Vanc trough.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Per vascular, pt is a poor surgical candidate and would likely die if
   he underwent surgery at this point.  Will increase pt
s Levophed to
   maintain MAPs > 70 (to try to improve perfusion of LE) and monitor.  Pt
   may need arterial US study at a later point.
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Resolved when Heparin discontinued. Will restart
   heparin flushes and lovenox once daily and closely monitoring PTT.
   - Pneumoboots
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled presently with amiodarone and
   metoprolol, and now therapeutic on coumadin.  will need outpt

","The patient's condition is quite complex and involves multiple organ systems. Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and recurrent respiratory failure. This indicates a risk of continued respiratory distress and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Status epilepticus: The patient is currently experiencing ongoing seizures, which are resistant to treatment. This poses a risk of further neurological damage and potential complications related to the underlying cause of the seizures.

3. Wound infection: The patient has an infected wound post below-knee amputation, with growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This bacterium is known for its resistance to certain antibiotics, so appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued to prevent further infection spread.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has trended down, indicating a possible risk of bleeding complications. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause and guide management.

5. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which may be related to medication sensitivity or other factors. Close monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support will be needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.

6. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to bicarbonate loss or volume resuscitation. Monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances will be essential.

7. Anemia: The patient has chronic disease-related anemia"

   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs in response to lasix o/n x 2. Pt has anasarca and whole body fluid
   overload, but, given his low albumin and poor nutritional status (with
   resulting low oncotic pressure), maintaining intravascular volume will
   be difficult.
   - decrease FiO2 from 50 to 40 as tolerated

   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt
s platelets have trended down from 600s to low
   100s today.  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI), but will also evaluate for
   HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high risk for HIT given timing of
   drop in platelets, clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the
   past. He has no known thrombosis

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient presented with respiratory failure, status epilepticus, and a wound infection post-amputation. He has been unresponsive to verbal or tactile stimuli and has experienced recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications including thrombocytopenia, hypotension, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, leukocytosis, necrotizing myopathy, and hypothyroidism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending down, indicating a possible drop in platelets. There are multiple potential etiologies for this, including bone marrow suppression, drug adverse effects, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient is at high risk for HIT due to the timing of the drop in platelets, clinical setting, and history of heparin use. Monitoring for HIT antibodies and discontinuing all heparin products are recommended.

2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypotension on multiple occasions, particularly after receiving certain medications. This may be due to medication sensitivity. Continuing home prednisone, monitoring for adequate blood pressure, and using norepineph"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted on 10/18 for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post dental cleaning, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was extubated on 10/27 but then had to be reintubated on 10/31 due to recurrent respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes status epilepticus, necrotizing myopathy, R LE wound infection, and hypotension. The patient has a history of chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to myopathy, though unclear. There is also concern for anemia of chronic disease, leukocytosis, and possible infection. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is on aspirin and Plavix. The patient is also diagnosed with systolic congestive heart failure, necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies, GERD, hypothyroidism, and DM2.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 114/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's physical examination shows unresponsiveness, distended abdomen, and a wound lesion on the right stump without significant erythema.

   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs in response to lasix o/n x 2. Pt has anasarca and whole body fluid
   overload, but, given his low albumin and poor nutritional status (with
   resulting low oncotic pressure), maintaining intravascular volume will
   be difficult.
   - decrease FiO2 from 50 to 40 as tolerated
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb

   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt

   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt
s platelets have trended down from 600s to low

   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI), but will also evaluate for
   HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high risk for HIT given timing of
   drop in platelets, clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the
   past. He has no known thrombosis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient has had multiple complications including respiratory failure, status epilepticus, and a wound infection post-amputation. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but he remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has been experiencing myoclonic jerks. Imaging studies show bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and anasarca. Laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia, elevated PTT, and a drop in hemoglobin. The patient's conditions include hypotension, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, leukocytosis, necrotizing myopathy, GERD, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of vasculopathy who underwent below-knee amputation (BKA) and experienced post-operative respiratory failure and status epilepticus. He has multiple allergies, including penicillins, hydrocodone, and certain medications that can cause hallucinations or myopathy. The patient is currently on several medications such as antibiotics, statins, insulin, and amiodarone. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, blood pressure ranging from 109/42 mmHg to 130/74 mmHg, heart rate between 69-81 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 506 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. His respiratory support is adequate based on the ABG results.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular findings, clear breath sounds, presence of bowel sounds, and right and left lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows that the patient is unresponsive and has no movement or assessed tone.

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels,"

   - Outside neurologist [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12348**] [**Doctor Last Name **] at [**Hospital1 **], reachable at cell
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12349**] over holiday weekend.  Updated her re: status.  Given
   history that she is hearing, concerned most re: hypoxic/anoxic injury
   leading to globally altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  His underlying neurologic
   disease should not be playing a role here.  Also consider restarting
   acyclovir until PCR back given that he is immunosuppressed and may have
   normal CSF studies in this setting even with true infection.
   Interested in our neurologist's input re: prognosis given difficulty
   breaking [**Last Name (Titles) **].  She is available for discussion with wife if
   withdrawal of care recommended.
   - Per neuro, no szr activity in 36hrs since pt first received phenobarb
   IV, will continue current regimen for now, and start weaning down
   phenobarb later.
   - Pt w. decreased UOP yesterday (5-15cc/hr).  Sent urine lytes, EOs.
   Little response to fluid bolus or increased dose of Levo. Suspect this
   is due to ATN from recent hypotensive episodes.
   - Increased goal MAP to > 70 try to improve perfusion of L LE

   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs in response to lasix o/n x 2. Pt has anasarca and whole body fluid
   overload, but, given his low albumin and poor nutritional status (with
   resulting low oncotic pressure), maintaining intravascular volume will
   be difficult.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - s/p 5 day course of IVIG
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - given pt
s altered mental status, uncontrolled [**Month/Year (2) **] activity and
   overall worse clinical status, will not extubate today;
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose; now on
   maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - s/p loading with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin (Goal: 1800mg) reaching
   Dilantin level of 5.5 (corrected for albumin to10.2 this AM.  Will
   continue Dilantin 100 mg PO/NG Q8H, following levels after every 3rd
   dose.
   - s/p loading with phenobarbitol, post-loading level 21.6; started
   Phenobarbital 50mg IV TID, following levels after every 3rd dose.
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt
s platelets have trended down from 600s to low
   100s today.  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI), but will also evaluate for
   HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high risk for HIT given timing of
   drop in platelets, clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the
   past. He has no known thrombosis
although pt does have AMS and we plan
   to evaluate for CVA with MRI.  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently off norepinephrine.
   - On home prednisone 5mg daily but will start patient on stress-dosed
   steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr).
   - Norepinephrine as needed for MAP >70
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far.
   - C. diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; f/u Vanco levels today and dose again per Rx
   .
   # PVD s/p R BKA. Most recent wound cxr growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]),
   resistant to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc; dosing based on Vanc trough.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Per vascular, pt is a poor surgical candidate and would likely die if
   he underwent surgery at this point.  Will increase pt
s Levophed to
   maintain MAPs > 70 (to try to improve perfusion of LE) and monitor.  Pt
   may need arterial US study at a later point.
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Resolved when Heparin discontinued. Will restart
   heparin flushes and lovenox once daily and closely monitoring PTT.
   - Pneumoboots
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled presently with amiodarone and
   metoprolol, and now therapeutic on coumadin.  will need outpt

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and myasthenia gravis. He was initially intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure but was extubated on 10/29. However, he had to be reintubated on 11/1 due to recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He has a history of necrotizing myopathy and myasthenia antibodies, and his seizures are not believed to be part of this disease process. He also has anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, for which various interventions have been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a potential complication related to respiratory function. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjustment of ventilator settings may be necessary.

2. Infection: The presence of Pseudomonas infection in the surgical wound suggests a risk of infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and wound care should be continued to prevent further complications.

3. Cardiac Issues: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure puts him at risk for cardiac complications. Monitoring of his cardiac status and"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Outside neurologist [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12348**] [**Doctor Last Name **] at [**Hospital1 **], reachable at cell
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12349**] over holiday weekend.  Updated her re: status.  Given
   history that she is hearing, concerned most re: hypoxic/anoxic injury
   leading to globally altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  His underlying neurologic
   disease should not be playing a role here.  Also consider restarting
   acyclovir until PCR back given that he is immunosuppressed and may have

   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs in response to lasix o/n x 2. Pt has anasarca and whole body fluid
   overload, but, given his low albumin and poor nutritional status (with
   resulting low oncotic pressure), maintaining intravascular volume will
   be difficult.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by

   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24

   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine x 6 days, since he became hypotensive in
   the setting of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Norepinephrine as needed for MAP >70
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; f/u Vanco levels today and dose again per Rx,
   as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to cover any septic
   physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare EOs. Pt is likely in oligouric
   phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc; dosing based on Vanc trough.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs and try to touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2494**]
   (vascular attending).
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Resolved when Heparin discontinued. Will restart
   heparin flushes and lovenox once daily with close monitoring PTT.
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled presently with amiodarone and
   metoprolol.  Will need outpt cardiology f/u.
   - On Metoprolol po 12.5mg tid through NG tube.
   - On amiodarone 400mg daily x 7 days (day [**12-24**]) with d/c [**11-10**], then
   200mg daily maintenance
   - Houlding coumadin for now, pending improvement in pt
s clinical
   status.
   - Daily ASA 81mg.
   .
   # Hct drop: now stabilized.
   -  final read of CT torso
 no hematoma or site of bleeding.
   .
   # Anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 concern for dropping  WBC now; trend daily.
   no clear evidence of infection presently, resolving without
   antibiotics.  did have fever 101.8 post-op on [**10-24**], though unclear if
   he has had recurrence.  R LE shows erythema c/w cellulitis and has
   purulent drainage from site.  Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas
   resistant to zosyn, sensitive to cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Per
   vascular surgery team, pt
s wound also grew out VRE from swab at OSH.
   Most recent wound cxr growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), res to Meropenem,
   [**Last Name (un) 270**] to Cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime, Vanc
   - infectious w/u as above
   .
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
   - holding diuresis now given hypotension with lasix
   - daily weights.
   .
   # necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  on cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days
   .
   # GERD
 on PPI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   .
   # DM2 - covered with insulin gtt in SICU.
   - cover with SSI.
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 100mL q4h. Will aggressively
   replete electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve
   both respiratory status and peripheral circulation). Check ionized Ca.
   # Prophylaxis: Lovenox 30mg SQ daily. Pneumoboots. PPI.
   # Code:  FULL
   # Communication: Patient, wife [**Name (NI) 4617**] (cell) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12121**], (home)
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12122**]; will be sure to update her with any changes in patient
   management or clinical status.
   # Disposition: ICU for now, pending improved respiratory and mental
   status and discussion with neuro re: status epilepticus. When patient
   stabilized, will discuss transferring patient per pt
s wife

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA) with subsequent complications including atrial fibrillation, necrotizing myopathy, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has a history of chronic metabolic alkalosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease.

Current Issues:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - The patient continues to have some degree of hypoventilation despite pressure support.
2. Anasarca and fluid overload - The patient has anasarca and whole-body fluid overload, with difficulty maintaining intravascular volume due to low albumin and poor nutritional status.
3. Hypotension - The patient has been hypotensive on multiple occasions, particularly after diuretic administration and antiepileptic drug loading.
4. Acute renal failure - The patient has rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN) likely due to recent hypotensive episodes.
5. Pseudomonas wound infection - The patient's right BKA wound is infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, resistant to meropenem but sensitive to cefepime.
6. Thrombocytopenia - The patient's platelet count has trended down from the 600s to low 100s, possibly due to bone marrow suppression or drug adverse"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Outside neurologist [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12348**] [**Doctor Last Name **] at [**Hospital1 **], reachable at cell
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12349**] over holiday weekend.  Updated her re: status.  Given
   history that she is hearing, concerned most re: hypoxic/anoxic injury
   leading to globally altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  His underlying neurologic
   disease should not be playing a role here.  Also consider restarting
   acyclovir until PCR back given that he is immunosuppressed and may have
   normal CSF studies in this setting even with true infection.
   Interested in our neurologist's input re: prognosis given difficulty
   breaking [**Last Name (Titles) **].  She is available for discussion with wife if
   withdrawal of care recommended.
   - Per neuro, no szr activity in 36hrs since pt first received phenobarb
   IV, will continue current regimen for now, and start weaning down
   phenobarb later.
   - Pt w. decreased UOP yesterday (5-15cc/hr).  Sent urine lytes, EOs.
   Little response to fluid bolus or increased dose of Levo. Suspect this
   is due to ATN from recent hypotensive episodes.
   - Increased goal MAP to > 70 try to improve perfusion of L LE
   extremity, which appears cool and grey.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs in response to lasix o/n x 2. Pt has anasarca and whole body fluid
   overload, but, given his low albumin and poor nutritional status (with
   resulting low oncotic pressure), maintaining intravascular volume will
   be difficult.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - s/p 5 day course of IVIG
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - given pt
s altered mental status, uncontrolled [**Month/Year (2) **] activity and
   overall worse clinical status, will not extubate today;
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose; now on
   maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - s/p loading with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin (Goal: 1800mg) reaching
   Dilantin level of 5.5 (corrected for albumin to10.2 this AM.  Will
   continue Dilantin 100 mg PO/NG Q8H, following levels after every 3rd
   dose.
   - s/p loading with phenobarbitol, post-loading level 21.6; started
   Phenobarbital 50mg IV TID, following levels after every 3rd dose.
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.

   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt
s platelets have trended down from 600s to low
   100s today.  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI), but will also evaluate for
   HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high risk for HIT given timing of
   drop in platelets, clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the
   past. He has no known thrombosis
although pt does have AMS and we plan
   to evaluate for CVA with MRI.  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently off norepinephrine.
   - On home prednisone 5mg daily but will start patient on stress-dosed
   steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr).
   - Norepinephrine as needed for MAP >70
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far.
   - C. diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; f/u Vanco levels today and dose again per Rx
   .
   # PVD s/p R BKA. Most recent wound cxr growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]),
   resistant to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc; dosing based on Vanc trough.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Per vascular, pt is a poor surgical candidate and would likely die if
   he underwent surgery at this point.  Will increase pt
s Levophed to
   maintain MAPs > 70 (to try to improve perfusion of LE) and monitor.  Pt
   may need arterial US study at a later point.
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Resolved when Heparin discontinued. Will restart
   heparin flushes and lovenox once daily and closely monitoring PTT.
   - Pneumoboots
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled presently with amiodarone and
   metoprolol, and now therapeutic on coumadin.  will need outpt
   cardiology f/u.
   - On Metoprolol po 12.5mg tid through NG tube.
   - On amiodarone 400mg daily x 7 days (day [**12-24**]) with d/c [**11-10**], then
   200mg daily maintenance

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, necrotizing myopathy, and seizures. He was admitted to the ICU for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA) and subsequently developed hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been treated with various medications including antiepileptic drugs, steroids, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic disease anemia, leukocytosis, and multiple comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently intubated. There is a concern for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly due to myopathy or medication-induced hypoventilation. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Seizure Activity: The patient has had multiple seizure episodes and is currently on multiple antiepileptic drugs. Monitoring of seizure activity and follow-up EEG monitoring are important to assess the effectiveness of the current antiepileptic regimen.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has trended down from the 600s to low 100s. Possible causes include drug-induced bone marrow suppression, inflammation, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation for HIT antibodies and monitoring of platelet count are necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of hypotension, which may be related to medication sensitivity. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate hemodynamic support with vasopressors are needed.
5. Infection: The patient has been treated for various infections including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Continued surveillance for signs of infection and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are essential.
6. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. Close monitoring of cardiac function and appropriate management of rate control and anticoagulation are necessary.
7. Anemia: The patient has chronic disease anemia, which may require ongoing blood transfusions. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and iron studies is important.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been elevated, which could be a response to infection or inflammation. Close monitoring and trend analysis of white blood cell counts are necessary.
9. Medication-induced Complications: Some of the patient's medications may have adverse effects on various organ systems. Monitoring for any medication-induced complications is important.
10. Potential Surgical Complications: The patient underwent a BKA, and there is a concern for postoperative wound complications. Close monitoring of the surgical site and appropriate wound care are necessary.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications requiring careful monitoring and management."

   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs in response to lasix o/n x 2. Pt has anasarca and whole body fluid
   overload, but, given his low albumin and poor nutritional status (with
   resulting low oncotic pressure), maintaining intravascular volume will
   be difficult.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - s/p 5 day course of IVIG
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - Given pt
s altered mental status, and the significant amount of
   sedating medications he is on for anti-epileptic therapy, will not
   extubate today.
   -VBG today, per renal
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose; now on
   maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - s/p loading with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin (Goal: 1800mg) reaching
   Dilantin level of 5.5 (corrected for albumin to10.2 this AM.  Will
   continue Dilantin 100 mg PO/NG Q8H, following levels after every 3rd
   dose.
   - s/p loading with phenobarbitol, post-loading level 21.6; started
   Phenobarbital 50mg IV TID, following levels after every 3rd dose.
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen; would like to
   decrease the dose of AEDs substantially, as this is likely contributing
   substantially to both the pt
s AMS and his pressor requirement.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine x 6 days, since he became hypotensive in
   the setting of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Norepinephrine as needed for MAP >70
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; f/u Vanco levels today and dose again per Rx,
   as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to cover any septic
   physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare EOs. Pt is likely in oligouric
   phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc; dosing based on Vanc trough.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs and try to touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2494**]
   (vascular attending).
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Resolved when Heparin discontinued. Will restart
   heparin flushes and lovenox once daily with close monitoring PTT.
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled presently with amiodarone and
   metoprolol.  Will need outpt cardiology f/u.
   - On Metoprolol po 12.5mg tid through NG tube.
   - On amiodarone 400mg daily x 7 days (day [**12-24**]) with d/c [**11-10**], then
   200mg daily maintenance
   - Houlding coumadin for now, pending improvement in pt
s clinical
   status.
   - Daily ASA 81mg.
   .
   # Hct drop: now stabilized.
   -  final read of CT torso
 no hematoma or site of bleeding.
   .
   # Anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 concern for dropping  WBC now; trend daily.
   no clear evidence of infection presently, resolving without
   antibiotics.  did have fever 101.8 post-op on [**10-24**], though unclear if

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient has several medical complications. These include:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood sugar levels, which needs to be managed and controlled.

2. Acidosis, mixed: The patient's body is experiencing an imbalance in acid-base levels, with a combination of metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis. This requires immediate attention and intervention.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is showing signs of kidney dysfunction, as indicated by rising creatinine levels and decreasing urine output. This may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by hypotension.

4. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing changes in mental function, including confusion and possible hallucinations. This could be related to various factors, such as medications, sepsis, or brain dysfunction.

5. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient is having difficulty breathing and requires mechanical ventilation support. There are concerns about the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, necessitating the use of vasopressors to maintain adequate blood flow.

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has wounds and skin issues, including an infected wound that requires antibiotic treatment.

8. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient is in an irregular heart rhythm, which needs to be managed with rate control medications.

   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of
   IVIG.
   - start lasix gtt for slow but steady diuresis, goal -50cc/hour and
   titrate as needed to urine output plus pressor need
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding bolus diuresis for now
   given low BPs in response to lasix o/n x 2. Pt has anasarca and whole
   body fluid overload, but, given his low albumin and poor nutritional
   status (with resulting low oncotic pressure), maintaining intravascular
   volume will be difficult.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - f/u Neurology recs
   -VBG today, per renal
   - MAP >70 per vascular to perfuse stump
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose; now on
   maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - s/p loading with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin (Goal: 1800mg) reaching
   Dilantin level of 5.5 (corrected for albumin to10.2 this AM.  Will
   continue Dilantin 100 mg PO/NG Q8H, following levels after every 3rd
   dose.
   - d/c phenobarbitol
   - f/u with neuro re; prognosis, EEG, dosing of keppra and dilantin and
   when to do level checks; for now keep doses as they are
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen; would like to
   decrease the dose of AEDs substantially, as this is likely contributing
   substantially to both the pt
s AMS and his pressor requirement.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine x 6 days, since he became hypotensive in
   the setting of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Norepinephrine as needed for MAP >70, also on vasopressin
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - hold on bicarb for now
   - lasix as above
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare EOs. Pt is likely in oligouric
   phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs and try to touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2494**]
   (vascular attending).
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Resolved when Heparin discontinued. Will restart
   heparin flushes and lovenox once daily with close monitoring PTT.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for various medical conditions. The patient's medical history includes a recent below-knee amputation (BKA), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and necrotizing myopathy with a history of myasthenia antibodies. 

The patient's current health issues include:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood sugar levels, which may be due to his diabetes mellitus type 2. 

2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels have been trending downwards, indicating a metabolic acidosis. This could be caused by several factors such as bicarbonate loss, volume resuscitation, or septic physiology.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and decreasing urine output suggest acute renal failure. The likely cause is acute tubular necrosis (ATN), possibly due to hypotensive episodes. 

4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing repeated episodes of hypotension, which may be attributed to medication sensitivity, specifically the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) he is taking.

5. Pseudomonas wound infection: The patient's right lower extremity wound culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to meropenem but sensitive to cefepime.

   Microbiology: None new
   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of
   IVIG.
   - start lasix gtt for slow but steady diuresis, goal -50cc/hour and
   titrate as needed to urine output plus pressor need
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding bolus diuresis for now
   given low BPs in response to lasix o/n x 2. Pt has anasarca and whole
   body fluid overload, but, given his low albumin and poor nutritional
   status (with resulting low oncotic pressure), maintaining intravascular
   volume will be difficult.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - MAP >70 per vascular to perfuse stump
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose; now on
   maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - s/p loading with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin (Goal: 1800mg) reaching
   Dilantin level of 5.5 (corrected for albumin to10.2 this AM.  Will
   continue Dilantin 100 mg PO/NG Q8H, following levels after every 3rd
   dose.
   - d/c phenobarbitol
   - f/u with neuro re; prognosis, EEG, dosing of keppra and dilantin and
   when to do level checks; for now keep doses as they are
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen; would like to
   decrease the dose of AEDs substantially, as this is likely contributing
   substantially to both the pt
s AMS and his pressor requirement.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine x 6 days, since he became hypotensive in
   the setting of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Norepinephrine as needed for MAP >70, also on vasopressin
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - hold on bicarb for now
   - lasix as above
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare EOs. Pt is likely in oligouric
   phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Lasix as above
   - Initiated on CVVH yesterday
   - Follow up renal recs
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Resolved when Heparin discontinued. Will restart
   heparin flushes and lovenox once daily with close monitoring PTT.
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled presently with amiodarone and
   metoprolol.  Will need outpt cardiology f/u.
   - On Metoprolol po 12.5mg tid through NG tube.
   - On amiodarone 400mg daily x 7 days (day [**12-24**]) with d/c [**11-10**], then
   200mg daily maintenance
   - Houlding coumadin for now, pending improvement in pt

   # Anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 concern for dropping  WBC now; trend daily.
   no clear evidence of infection presently, resolving without
   antibiotics.  did have fever 101.8 post-op on [**10-24**], though unclear if
   he has had recurrence.  R LE shows erythema c/w cellulitis and has
   purulent drainage from site.  Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas
   resistant to zosyn, sensitive to cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Per
   vascular surgery team, pt
s wound also grew out VRE from swab at OSH.
   Most recent wound cxr growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), res to Meropenem,
   [**Last Name (un) 270**] to Cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime, Vanc
   - infectious w/u as above

   .
   # necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  on cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted on 10/18 for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a course complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after direct current cardioversion, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated on 10/27 but had to be reintubated on 10/31 due to recurrent respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, wound infection with Pseudomonas resistant to meropenem but sensitive to cefepime, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. The patient's recent labs show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels.

The patient's medical history includes a history of left below-knee amputation, chronic myopathy, myasthenia antibodies, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including norepinephrine, cefepime, vancomycin, phenytoin, ativan, lasix, cellcept, prednisone, levothyroxine, aspirin, and plavix. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/41 mmH"

   the
   cardiac silhouette are slightly enlarged. Unchanged course and position

   Microbiology: None new
   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of
   IVIG.
   - start lasix gtt for slow but steady diuresis, goal -50cc/hour and
   titrate as needed to urine output plus pressor need
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding bolus diuresis for now
   given low BPs in response to lasix o/n x 2. Pt has anasarca and whole
   body fluid overload, but, given his low albumin and poor nutritional
   status (with resulting low oncotic pressure), maintaining intravascular
   volume will be difficult.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - MAP >70 per vascular to perfuse stump
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose; now on
   maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - s/p loading with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin (Goal: 1800mg) reaching
   Dilantin level of 5.5 (corrected for albumin to10.2 this AM.  Will
   continue Dilantin 100 mg PO/NG Q8H, following levels after every 3rd
   dose.
   - d/c phenobarbitol
   - f/u with neuro re; prognosis, EEG, dosing of keppra and dilantin and
   when to do level checks; for now keep doses as they are
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen; would like to
   decrease the dose of AEDs substantially, as this is likely contributing
   substantially to both the pt
s AMS and his pressor requirement.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine x 6 days, since he became hypotensive in
   the setting of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Norepinephrine as needed for MAP >70, also on vasopressin
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - hold on bicarb for now
   - lasix as above
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare EOs. Pt is likely in oligouric
   phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Lasix as above
   - Initiated on CVVH yesterday
   - Follow up renal recs
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Resolved when Heparin discontinued. Will restart
   heparin flushes and lovenox once daily with close monitoring PTT.
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled presently with amiodarone and
   metoprolol.  Will need outpt cardiology f/u.
   - On Metoprolol po 12.5mg tid through NG tube.
   - On amiodarone 400mg daily x 7 days (day [**12-24**]) with d/c [**11-10**], then
   200mg daily maintenance
   - Houlding coumadin for now, pending improvement in pt
s clinical
   status.
   - Daily ASA 81mg.

   # Hct drop: now stabilized.
   -  Final read of CT torso
 no hematoma or site of bleeding.

   # Anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 concern for dropping  WBC now; trend daily.
   no clear evidence of infection presently, resolving without
   antibiotics.  did have fever 101.8 post-op on [**10-24**], though unclear if
   he has had recurrence.  R LE shows erythema c/w cellulitis and has
   purulent drainage from site.  Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas
   resistant to zosyn, sensitive to cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Per
   vascular surgery team, pt
s wound also grew out VRE from swab at OSH.
   Most recent wound cxr growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), res to Meropenem,
   [**Last Name (un) 270**] to Cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime, Vanc
   - infectious w/u as above
   .
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
   - holding diuresis now given hypotension with lasix
   - daily weights.
   .
   # necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  on cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days
   .
   # GERD
 on PPI

","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and a distant history of left below-knee amputation. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, wound infection, and seizures.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications that require management:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient continues to have some degree of hypoventilation despite pressure support. His CXR shows evidence of moderate pulmonary edema and extensive bilateral basal atelectasis.
2. Hypotension: The patient has become hypotensive on multiple occasions, particularly after receiving lasix diuresis and phenytoin. It is suspected that his significant antiepileptic drug (AED) dosing is contributing to this issue. The patient is currently on norepinephrine and vasopressin.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels have trended downwards, indicating a possible mixed acidosis. This could be due to bicarbonate loss, volume resuscitation, or septic physiology.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has rising creatinine levels and decreasing urine output, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is oliguric and requires improvement in kidney perfusion.
5. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD): The patient"

   CXR [**11-11**] - Evidence of moderate pulmonary edema is better visualized
   on today's radiograph. Extensive bilateral basal areas of atelectasis,
   notably in the retrocardiac region. The visible parts of the cardiac

   Microbiology: None new
   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of
   IVIG.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by

   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose; now on
   maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - s/p loading with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin (Goal: 1800mg), on Dilantin
   125mg TID, need to check level today

   when to do level checks; for now keep doses as they are
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen; would like to
   decrease the dose of AEDs substantially, as this is likely contributing
   substantially to both the pt
s AMS and his pressor requirement.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine, since he became hypotensive in the setting
   of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Norepinephrine as needed for MAP >70,
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - CVVH per renal
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Initiated on CVVH yesterday
   - Follow up renal recs
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively to maintain peripheral vascular
   tone and improve perfusion.

   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Resolved when Heparin discontinued. Will restart
   heparin flushes and lovenox once daily with close monitoring PTT.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Per discussion w. neuro over the phone, EEG is very abnormal and likely
   has ""subclinical seizure"" activity, with patient off of phenobarb x 1
   day (still on phenytoin/keppra).  Recommended loading phenytoin w.
   500mg PO, slowly to try to avoid hypotension, and re-starting phenobarb
   at 50mg TID to try to ""normalize the EEG"".  Per neuro, EEG looks anoxic
   and highly abnormal, and pt is unlikely to wake up unless some
   improvement is seen. These were given sequentially so neuro can see
   individual effects on EEG, w. full dose of phenytoin given by 2200 and
   phenobarb given at 0020.
   - Although weaned off of pressors during the day, pt had to be
   re-started on levophed to maintain SBP > 95 in the afternoon. Cont'd on
   pressors while loading phenytoin and re-starting phenobarb.
   - Around 2300, went into A. fib w. RVR (rate in 130s, BPs stable). ECG
   showed Afib w, RVR without STT changes. Tried to wean down levophed to
   decrease adrenergic stimulus and gave 500cc NS bolus, in case fluid
   removal with CVVH was trigger, without improvement. Pt also given Dilt
   10mg IV x2 (20mg total)  without improvement. Finally, pt given Metop
   10mg IV x2, Metop 5mg x 1 (25mg total) and Metop 25mg PO x1 and HR
   returned to 90s.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of
   IVIG.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - MAP >70 per vascular to perfuse stump
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - Now  on maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue  Dilantin 125mg TID
   - Per Neuro re load Phenobarbital with 10mg/kg, recheck level 2 hours
   level.
   - f/u with neuro re; prognosis, EEG, dosing of keppra and dilantin and
   when to do level checks; for now keep doses as they are
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen; would like to
   decrease the dose of AEDs substantially, as this is likely contributing
   substantially to both the pt
s AMS and his pressor requirement.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine, since he became hypotensive in the setting
   of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Change to Nosynephrine as needed for MAP >70,
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - CVVH per renal
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Initiated on CVVH yesterday
   - Follow up renal recs
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively to maintain peripheral vascular
   tone and improve perfusion.
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - Plan to restart Heparin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU PTT tonight.
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   ..
   # Anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 resolved.
   Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas resistant to zosyn, sensitive to
   cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Per vascular surgery team, pt
s wound
   also grew out VRE from swab at OSH.  Most recent wound cxr growing
   Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), res to Meropenem, [**Last Name (un) 270**] to Cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime, Vanc
   - infectious w/u as above
   .
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
   - holding diuresis now given hypotension with lasix
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   .
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  on cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient was initially extubated but had to be reintubated due to recurrent respiratory failure.
- The patient has a chronic metabolic alkalosis and an unclear cause of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient's current condition includes status epilepticus, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, peripheral vascular disease, thrombocytopenia, elevated PTT, anemia, chronic disease, leukocytosis, congestive heart failure, necrotizing myopathy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 2, and feeding tube placement.
- The patient's medical history includes a recent right below-knee amputation with wound infection, and a history of left below-knee amputation.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications including phenobarbital, phenytoin, keppra, diltiazem, metoprolol, pantoprazole, vancomycin, cefepime, lasix, ativan, and others.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 106/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's lab results show abnormal values including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- The patient's physical examination findings include the presence of an endotracheal tube, course breath sounds bilaterally, irregular heart rhythm, and unresponsiveness with posturing to pain.
- The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for various conditions such as status epilepticus, respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and others.
- The patient's family has been updated on the patient's management and clinical status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and recurrent respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for intubation.
2. Seizure activity: The patient is experiencing status epilepticus and has abnormal EEG findings, indicating ongoing seizure activity. This can lead to increased risk of further seizures and potential complications such as brain injury or medication toxicity.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with rising creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and accumulation of toxic substances in the body.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of wound infection and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of developing new infections or resistant organisms, which can complicate the clinical course.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially if the platelet count drops further or if the patient requires invasive procedures.
6. Hypotension: The"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Per discussion w. neuro over the phone, EEG is very abnormal and likely
   has ""subclinical seizure"" activity, with patient off of phenobarb x 1
   day (still on phenytoin/keppra).  Recommended loading phenytoin w.
   500mg PO, slowly to try to avoid hypotension, and re-starting phenobarb
   at 50mg TID to try to ""normalize the EEG"".  Per neuro, EEG looks anoxic
   and highly abnormal, and pt is unlikely to wake up unless some
   improvement is seen. These were given sequentially so neuro can see
   individual effects on EEG, w. full dose of phenytoin given by 2200 and
   phenobarb given at 0020.
   - Although weaned off of pressors during the day, pt had to be
   re-started on levophed to maintain SBP > 95 in the afternoon. Cont'd on
   pressors while loading phenytoin and re-starting phenobarb.
   - Around 2300, went into A. fib w. RVR (rate in 130s, BPs stable). ECG
   showed Afib w, RVR without STT changes. Tried to wean down levophed to
   decrease adrenergic stimulus and gave 500cc NS bolus, in case fluid
   removal with CVVH was trigger, without improvement. Pt also given Dilt
   10mg IV x2 (20mg total)  without improvement. Finally, pt given Metop
   10mg IV x2, Metop 5mg x 1 (25mg total) and Metop 25mg PO x1 and HR
   returned to 90s.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of
   IVIG.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - MAP >70 per vascular to perfuse stump
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose; now on
   maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - s/p loading with 20mg/kg of Fosphenytoin (Goal: 1800mg), on Dilantin
   125mg TID, need to check level today
   - d/c phenobarbitol and monitor EEG x 1 day, f/u EEG monitoring w.
   neuro
   - f/u with neuro re; prognosis, EEG, dosing of keppra and dilantin and
   when to do level checks; for now keep doses as they are
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen; would like to
   decrease the dose of AEDs substantially, as this is likely contributing
   substantially to both the pt
s AMS and his pressor requirement.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine, since he became hypotensive in the setting
   of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Norepinephrine as needed for MAP >70,
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - CVVH per renal
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Initiated on CVVH yesterday
   - Follow up renal recs
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively to maintain peripheral vascular
   tone and improve perfusion.
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.  Resolved when Heparin discontinued. Will restart
   heparin flushes and lovenox once daily with close monitoring PTT.
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled presently with amiodarone and
   metoprolol.  Will need outpt cardiology f/u.
   - On Metoprolol po 12.5mg tid through NG tube.
   - On amiodarone 400mg daily x 7 days (day [**12-24**]) with d/c [**11-10**], then
   200mg daily maintenance
   - Houlding coumadin for now, pending improvement in pt
s clinical
   status.
   - Daily ASA 81mg.
   .
   # Anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 concern for dropping  WBC now; trend daily.
   no clear evidence of infection presently, resolving without
   antibiotics.  did have fever 101.8 post-op on [**10-24**], though unclear if
   he has had recurrence.  R LE shows erythema c/w cellulitis and has
   purulent drainage from site.  Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas
   resistant to zosyn, sensitive to cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Per
   vascular surgery team, pt
s wound also grew out VRE from swab at OSH.
   Most recent wound cxr growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), res to Meropenem,
   [**Last Name (un) 270**] to Cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime, Vanc
   - infectious w/u as above

   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
   - holding diuresis now given hypotension with lasix
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   .
   # necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  on cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic renal failure. The patient has been experiencing recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a history of necrotizing myopathy and myasthenia gravis. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has necessitated multiple intubations and mechanical ventilation. The cause of this condition is unclear, but it may be related to the patient's myopathy and certain medications.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his current rhythm is controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol. He is also on Coumadin for anticoagulation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, as indicated by rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), possibly caused by hypotensive episodes during hospitalization.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending down from the 600s to the low 100s. Possible causes include bone marrow suppression, drug adverse effects, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, HIT antibodies were negative, suggesting another etiology.
5. Elevated PTT: The patient had an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which resolved when heparin was discontinued. He will restart heparin flushes and receive Lovenox once daily with close monitoring of PTT levels.
6. Necrotizing Myopathy: The patient has a history of necrotizing myopathy, which is being treated with IVIG and cellcept/prednisone.
7. GERD: The patient is being treated for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, managed with Synthroid.
9. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, controlled with insulin gtt in the SICU.

Plan:
1. Continue treatment for hypercarbic respiratory failure, including mechanical ventilation and pressor support as needed.
2. Monitor and manage atrial fibrillation with amiodarone and metoprolol.
3. Address acute renal failure by improving kidney perfusion and treating with CVVH.
4. Investigate and treat thrombocytopenia, considering bone marrow suppression or drug adverse effects.
5. Restart heparin flushes and provide Lovenox once daily while monitoring PTT levels.
6. Continue treatment for necrotizing myopathy with IVIG"

   HPI:
   65M with h/o PVD, CAD, DM2, s/p remote L BKA, presented on [**10-18**], with R
   LE ulcer/osteomyelitis to the vascular service.  He was started on IV
   linezolid, cipro, flagyl, and arrangements made for R BKA on [**10-23**]
   during which received 1U PRBC.
   .
   Post-op PACU note describes hypotension 96/40, with minimal oozing from
   wound.  He was transferred to the VICU.  On [**10-24**] Tmax 101.0, R LE wound
   swab grew pseduomonas (from amputated portion of leg per vascular).  On
   [**10-25**] @ 0847AM, pt noted to have AFIB with RVR 160s, SBP 95/60s->60/40,
   prompting neo gtt and transfer to CVICU and cardiology consultation.
   Pt received DCCVx1, and converted to NSR.  He received amiodarone load
   x 24hrs, then coverted to oral dosing x 1 week.  He was also started on
   heparin gtt, which was transitioned to oral comadin.  Cardiac enzymes
   were obtained, and troponin ranged from 0.40 to 0.53, with flat CK, MB
   peaked at 10.  TTE was obtained without new focal WMA.  He was
   transferred back to the vascular floor service on [**10-26**].
   .
   On arrival to the floor, he is described as ""lethargic, easy to
   arouse.""  BP on arrival 83/40, albumin hung, and BP up to [**9-/2148**].  Lung
   sounds dim with crackles.  On 2L NC 99%.  He was noted to be oliguric
   (180cc/24hr), and had a large ""explosive"" loose bowel movement.
   .
   - On [**10-27**], pt continued to be oliguric, with SBP in 80s, despite
   albumin and fluid boluses.  He triggered for ongoing oliguria and
   increasing somnolence.   Pt was placed on a NRB, ABG drawn (7.05/81/43
   @ 4AM), he was started on neo gtt, and then intubated for respiratory
   distress (no O2 sats in chart, time 04:46AM on [**10-27**]).  His ICU course
   is not documented, but he received 2U PRBC (HCT 27->34->27).  L UE USN
   obtained to r/o DVT.  Repeat TTE ordered (EF more depressed), heparin
   gtt stopped.  Cardiology re-consulted given worsening EF.  He has been
   off antibiotics since [**2197-10-24**].
   - Neuro recs: no changes for today, EEG looks much better--no szr
   activity.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY\
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of
   IVIG.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - MAP >70 per vascular to perfuse stump
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - Now  on maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue  Dilantin 125mg TID
   - Per Neuro re load Phenobarbital with 10mg/kg, recheck level 2 hours
   level.
   - f/u with neuro re; prognosis, EEG, dosing of keppra and dilantin and
   when to do level checks; for now keep doses as they are
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen; would like to
   decrease the dose of AEDs substantially, as this is likely contributing
   substantially to both the pt
s AMS and his pressor requirement.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine, since he became hypotensive in the setting
   of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Change to Nosynephrine as needed for MAP >70,
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - CVVH per renal
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Initiated on CVVH yesterday
   - Follow up renal recs
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively to maintain peripheral vascular
   tone and improve perfusion.
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - Plan to restart Heparin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU PTT tonight.
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   ..
   # Anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 resolved.
   Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas resistant to zosyn, sensitive to
   cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Per vascular surgery team, pt
s wound
   also grew out VRE from swab at OSH.  Most recent wound cxr growing
   Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), res to Meropenem, [**Last Name (un) 270**] to Cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime, Vanc
   - infectious w/u as above
   .
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
   - holding diuresis now given hypotension with lasix
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   .
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  on cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days
   .
   # GERD
 on PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), who underwent a below-knee amputation (BKA) due to a right lower extremity (LE) ulcer and osteomyelitis. He experienced multiple complications post-surgery, including hypotension, respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis, status epilepticus, and thrombocytopenia. The patient also has a history of necrotizing myopathy, myasthenia antibodies, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxia and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He requires mechanical ventilation to support his breathing.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is oliguric with rising creatinine levels, suggesting acute renal failure. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is being considered.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a wound infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to certain antibiotics. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) to cover for possible septicemia.
4. Status Epilepticus: The patient has had"

   Changes to medical and family history:
   65M with h/o PVD, CAD, DM2, s/p remote L BKA, presented on [**10-18**], with R
   LE ulcer/osteomyelitis to the vascular service.  He was started on IV
   linezolid, cipro, flagyl, and arrangements made for R BKA on [**10-23**]
   during which received 1U PRBC.
   .
   Post-op PACU note describes hypotension 96/40, with minimal oozing from
   wound.  He was transferred to the VICU.  On [**10-24**] Tmax 101.0, R LE wound
   swab grew pseduomonas (from amputated portion of leg per vascular).  On
   [**10-25**] @ 0847AM, pt noted to have AFIB with RVR 160s, SBP 95/60s->60/40,
   prompting neo gtt and transfer to CVICU and cardiology consultation.
   Pt received DCCVx1, and converted to NSR.  He received amiodarone load
   x 24hrs, then coverted to oral dosing x 1 week.  He was also started on
   heparin gtt, which was transitioned to oral comadin.  Cardiac enzymes
   were obtained, and troponin ranged from 0.40 to 0.53, with flat CK, MB
   peaked at 10.  TTE was obtained without new focal WMA.  He was
   transferred back to the vascular floor service on [**10-26**].
   .
   On arrival to the floor, he is described as ""lethargic, easy to
   arouse.""  BP on arrival 83/40, albumin hung, and BP up to [**9-/2148**].  Lung
   sounds dim with crackles.  On 2L NC 99%.  He was noted to be oliguric
   (180cc/24hr), and had a large ""explosive"" loose bowel movement.
   .
   - On [**10-27**], pt continued to be oliguric, with SBP in 80s, despite
   albumin and fluid boluses.  He triggered for ongoing oliguria and
   increasing somnolence.   Pt was placed on a NRB, ABG drawn (7.05/81/43
   @ 4AM), he was started on neo gtt, and then intubated for respiratory
   distress (no O2 sats in chart, time 04:46AM on [**10-27**]).  His ICU course
   is not documented, but he received 2U PRBC (HCT 27->34->27).  L UE USN
   obtained to r/o DVT.  Repeat TTE ordered (EF more depressed), heparin
   gtt stopped.  Cardiology re-consulted given worsening EF.  He has been
   off antibiotics since [**2197-10-24**].
   - Neuro recs: no changes for today, EEG looks much better--no szr
   activity.

   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of
   IVIG.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - MAP >70 per vascular to perfuse stump
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - Now  on maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue  Dilantin 125mg TID
   - Per Neuro re load Phenobarbital with 10mg/kg, recheck level 2 hours
   level.
   - f/u with neuro re; prognosis, EEG, dosing of keppra and dilantin and
   when to do level checks; for now keep doses as they are
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen; would like to
   decrease the dose of AEDs substantially, as this is likely contributing
   substantially to both the pt
s AMS and his pressor requirement.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine, since he became hypotensive in the setting
   of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Change to Nosynephrine as needed for MAP >70,
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - CVVH per renal
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Initiated on CVVH yesterday
   - Follow up renal recs
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively to maintain peripheral vascular
   tone and improve perfusion.
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - Plan to restart Heparin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU PTT tonight.
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   ..
   # Anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 resolved.
   Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas resistant to zosyn, sensitive to
   cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Per vascular surgery team, pt
s wound
   also grew out VRE from swab at OSH.  Most recent wound cxr growing
   Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), res to Meropenem, [**Last Name (un) 270**] to Cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime, Vanc
   - infectious w/u as above

   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  on cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and a remote history of below-knee amputation (BKA). He presented on 10/18 with right lower extremity (LE) ulcer/osteomyelitis and was admitted to the vascular service. He received intravenous linezolid, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole, and arrangements were made for right BKA on 10/23. During the operation, he received 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBC).

Post-operative, he developed hypotension and was transferred to the vascular intensive care unit (VICU). On 10/24, his temperature was 101.0 degrees Fahrenheit, and a wound swab grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa (from amputated portion of leg per vascular). On 10/25, he was noted to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) 160s, blood pressure (BP) 95/60s-60/40 mmHg, prompting neosynephrine and transfer to the cardiac care unit (CCU) and cardiology consultation. He received direct current cardioversion (DCCV) x 1, converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR), and started on amiodarone load x 24 hours, then converted to oral dosing x 1 week. He was also started on heparin drip, which was transitioned to oral warfarin. Cardiac enzymes were obtained, with troponin ranging from 0.40 to 0.53, and a flat creatine kinase (CK) with peak at 10. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was obtained without new focal wall motion abnormality (WMA). He was transferred back to the vascular floor service on 10/26.

On arrival to the floor, he was described as ""lethargic, easy to arouse."" His BP on arrival was 83/40 mmHg, and albumin was hung, raising his BP to 99/2148 mmHg. Lung sounds were diminished with crackles, and he had a respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute (BPM) on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC) with oxygen saturation (O2 sat) of 99%. He was oliguric (180 cc/24 hours), and had a large ""explosive"" loose bowel movement. He was started on neosynephrine and intubated for respiratory distress (no O2 sats in chart at time 04:46 AM on 10/27). His ICU course is not documented, but he received 2 units PRBC (hematocrit [HCT] 27-34-27). A left upper extremity (UE) ultrasound (USN) was obtained to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Repeat TTE was ordered (ejection fraction [EF] more depressed), and heparin drip was stopped. Cardiology was re-consulted given worsening EF. He has been off antibiotics since 10/24.

Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient has been experiencing elevated blood glucose levels, with readings ranging from 69 to 263 mg/dL.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels have been gradually trending downwards, indicating a metabolic acidosis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of respiratory failure, requiring intubation and pressor support.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension, despite medication interventions.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending down from the 600s to low 100s.
6. Elevated PTT: The patient has an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), likely due to the use of heparin in the setting of renal insufficiency.
7. Anemia: The patient has chronic disease-related anemia, requiring blood transfusions.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis but has since resolved.
9. GERD: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is on proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism and is on Synthroid.
11. DM2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and requires blood sugar control.
12. FEN: The patient is receiving tube feeds and free water flushes.
13. Prophylaxis: The patient is on various prophylactic medications, including Lovenox, pneumoboots, and PPI.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure and is being treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
2. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing low oxygen saturation levels.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and a below-knee amputation (BKA). The patient presented to the hospital with right lower extremity ulcer and osteomyelitis. He was started on IV antibiotics and arrangements were made for a right BKA. Post-operative, the patient developed hypotension and was transferred to the ICU.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues. He has experienced episodes of hypoxia, hypotension, and respiratory distress requiring intubation. The patient also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was converted to sinus rhythm (SR) after receiving direct current cardioversion (DCCV). He was started on amiodarone and later transitioned to oral comadin.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, as indicated by the low urine output (oliguria) and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. He has also developed acute kidney injury (AKI), which is likely due to the combination of hypotension, sepsis, and exposure to nephrotoxic medications.

Additionally, the patient has been experiencing altered mental status, hyperglycemia, and impaired skin integrity. His blood glucose levels have been significantly elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. The patient"

   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**12-19**] respiratory acidosis [**12-19**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of
   IVIG.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - MAP >70 per vascular to perfuse stump
   .
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per
   Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms
   (although pt very somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG
   showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures,
   increasingly organizing throughout the day.  Neurology recommended
   initiating Keppra [**11-6**] with maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24
   hour EEG monitoring to see if medications are adequately controlling
   the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an infectious etiology,
   although we will follow up on pending CSF studies, and his MRI does not
   show an epileptogenic focus.
   - Now  on maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue  Dilantin 125mg TID
   - Per Neuro re load Phenobarbital with 10mg/kg, recheck level 2 hours
   level.
   - f/u with neuro re; prognosis, EEG, dosing of keppra and dilantin and
   when to do level checks; for now keep doses as they are
   - f/u final results of EEG monitoring
   - follow up neuro recs re: antiepileptic regimen; would like to
   decrease the dose of AEDs substantially, as this is likely contributing
   substantially to both the pt
s AMS and his pressor requirement.
   - follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   .
   # Hypotension
 s/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan, have seen patient become
   hypotensive on multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive).
   Currently on norepinephrine, since he became hypotensive in the setting
   of Lasix diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - s/p 5 days of IVIG (as of [**11-6**])
   - Continue patient on stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt
   was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Change to Nosynephrine as needed for MAP >70,
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - CVVH per renal
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Initiated on CVVH yesterday
   - Follow up renal recs
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively to maintain peripheral vascular
   tone and improve perfusion.
   .
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - Plan to restart Heparin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU PTT tonight.
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   ..
   # Anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 resolved.
   Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas resistant to zosyn, sensitive to
   cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Per vascular surgery team, pt
s wound
   also grew out VRE from swab at OSH.  Most recent wound cxr growing
   Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), res to Meropenem, [**Last Name (un) 270**] to Cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime, Vanc
   - infectious w/u as above
   .
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
   - holding diuresis now given hypotension with lasix
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   .
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  on cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days
   .
   # GERD
 on PPI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   .
   # DM2 - cover with SSI.

   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve both
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation).
   # Prophylaxis: Lovenox 30mg SQ daily. Pneumoboots. PPI.

   HPI:
   65M with h/o PVD, CAD, DM2, s/p remote L BKA, presented on [**10-18**], with R
   LE ulcer/osteomyelitis to the vascular service.  He was started on IV
   linezolid, cipro, flagyl, and arrangements made for R BKA on [**10-23**]
   during which received 1U PRBC.
   Post-op PACU note describes hypotension 96/40, with minimal oozing from
   wound.  He was transferred to the VICU.  On [**10-24**] Tmax 101.0, R LE wound
   swab grew pseduomonas (from amputated portion of leg per vascular).  On
   [**10-25**] @ 0847AM, pt noted to have AFIB with RVR 160s, SBP 95/60s->60/40,
   prompting neo gtt and transfer to CVICU and cardiology consultation.
   Pt received DCCVx1, and converted to NSR.  He received amiodarone load
   x 24hrs, then coverted to oral dosing x 1 week.  He was also started on
   heparin gtt, which was transitioned to oral comadin.  Cardiac enzymes
   were obtained, and troponin ranged from 0.40 to 0.53, with flat CK, MB
   peaked at 10.  TTE was obtained without new focal WMA.  He was
   transferred back to the vascular floor service on [**10-26**].
   On arrival to the floor, he is described as ""lethargic, easy to
   arouse.""  BP on arrival 83/40, albumin hung, and BP up to [**9-/2148**].  Lung
   sounds dim with crackles.  On 2L NC 99%.  He was noted to be oliguric
   (180cc/24hr), and had a large ""explosive"" loose bowel movement.
   - On [**10-27**], pt continued to be oliguric, with SBP in 80s, despite
   albumin and fluid boluses.  He triggered for ongoing oliguria and
   increasing somnolence.   Pt was placed on a NRB, ABG drawn (7.05/81/43
   @ 4AM), he was started on neo gtt, and then intubated for respiratory
   distress (no O2 sats in chart, time 04:46AM on [**10-27**]).  His ICU course
   is not documented, but he received 2U PRBC (HCT 27->34->27).  L UE USN
   obtained to r/o DVT.  Repeat TTE ordered (EF more depressed), heparin
   gtt stopped.  Cardiology re-consulted given worsening EF.  He has been
   off antibiotics since [**2197-10-24**].
   - Neuro recs: no changes for today, EEG looks much better--no szr
   activity.

   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Details of decompensation unclear.  pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy, and
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  At present, he continues to have some degree of
   hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.  Otherwise, his CXR
   and exam are consistent with volume overload, no frank evidence of
   pneumonia. PE is less likely given therapeutic INR and on heparin gtt.
   No evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is handing his secretions
   effectively. Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**] for
   recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of IVIG.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   # Peripheral vascular disease
   - MAP >70 per vascular to perfuse stump
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks
   Given 2mg Ativan initially per Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with
   rapid resolution of symptoms (although pt very somnolent for 1 day
   after).  24 hour EEG showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of
   non-convulsive seizures, superimposed on diffuse and at times
   disorganized slow waves. Neurology recommended Keppra (started [**11-6**])
   and Dilantin, with continuing EEG monitoring to see if medications are
   adequately controlling the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an
   infectious etiology, although we will follow up on pending CSF studies,
   and his MRI does not show an epileptogenic focus. Now evolved into beta
   rhythm (my read) suggestive of sedation and perhaps consistent with
   continuing effect of lorazepam this afternoon (having titubation
   again).
   - Now  on maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue  Dilantin 125mg TID
   - Continue Phenobarbital with [**Hospital1 7**] level check given CVVH (should be
   loaded now and will give 75mg TID)
   - Follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   # Hypotension
   S/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan.  The patient has become hypotensive on
   multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive). Currently on
   norepinephrine, since he became hypotensive in the setting of Lasix
   diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - Continue stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt was on
   prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Change to Nosynephrine as needed for MAP >70,
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Stop Lopressor (!)
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - CVVH per renal
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Initiated on CVVH yesterday
   - Follow up renal recs
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively to maintain peripheral vascular
   tone and improve perfusion.
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - Plan to restart Heparin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Follow PTT
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   # Leukocytosis
 resolved.
   Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas resistant to zosyn, sensitive to
   cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Per vascular surgery team, pt
s wound
   also grew out VRE from swab at OSH.  Most recent wound cxr growing
   Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), res to Meropenem, [**Last Name (un) 270**] to Cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime, Vanc
   - infectious w/u as above
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   # Systolic CHF
   - holding diuresis now given hypotension with lasix
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2 - cover with SSI.
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Per Neuro, no seizure since [**98**]:30 a.m. (this afternoon).  My read of
   EEG was beat rhythm consistent with some sedation, possibly due to
   Ativan (given for titibation - in future may use phenobarb because of
   prolonged benzo action in this patient).  Neuro want us to continue
   dilantin, Keppra, phenobarb (follow level [**Hospital1 7**] - is lost in CVVH - so
   will need higher dosing). Gave another bolus of 5mg/kg then will
   maintain with 75 mg TID.
   - Minimally responsive last night
   - Phosphate low again - gave two packets Neutraphos at 6:00 a.m. (did
   not want to push fluid for KPhos)
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be able to go to HD today - will help maintain phenobarb level

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Details of decompensation unclear.  pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy, and
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  At present, he continues to have some degree of
   hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.  Otherwise, his CXR
   and exam are consistent with volume overload, no frank evidence of
   pneumonia. PE is less likely given therapeutic INR and on heparin gtt.
   No evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is handing his secretions
   effectively. Extubated on [**10-29**]. But had to be re-intubated [**11-1**] for
   recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  s/p 5 day course of IVIG.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   # Peripheral vascular disease
   - MAP >70 per vascular to perfuse stump
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks
   Given 2mg Ativan initially per Neuro recs for myoclonic jerks, with
   rapid resolution of symptoms (although pt very somnolent for 1 day
   after).  24 hour EEG showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of
   non-convulsive seizures, superimposed on diffuse and at times
   disorganized slow waves. Neurology recommended Keppra (started [**11-6**])
   and Dilantin, with continuing EEG monitoring to see if medications are
   adequately controlling the pt
s seizures. The LP did not suggest an
   infectious etiology, although we will follow up on pending CSF studies,
   and his MRI does not show an epileptogenic focus. Now evolved into beta
   rhythm (my read) suggestive of sedation and perhaps consistent with
   continuing effect of lorazepam this afternoon (having titubation
   again).
   - Now  on maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue  Dilantin 125mg TID
   - Continue Phenobarbital with [**Hospital1 7**] level check given CVVH (should be
   loaded now and will give 75mg TID)
   - Follow up CSF micro studies--HSV, VZV, [**Male First Name (un) 561**], protein electrophoresis,
   beta-2 microglobulin pending.
   # Hypotension
   S/p lasix, phenytoin, ativan.  The patient has become hypotensive on
   multiple occasions (very medication-sensitive). Currently on
   norepinephrine, since he became hypotensive in the setting of Lasix
   diuresis and Phenobarbital loading.
   - The most likely culprit for pt
s on-going hypotension is his
   significant AED dosing (Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarb). Until we are able
   to decrease the dose of these, it is unlikely that we will be able to
   come down on his pressor requirement.
   - Continue stress-dosed steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr); pt was on
   prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Change to Nosynephrine as needed for MAP >70,
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Stop Lopressor (!)
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   # Metabolic acidosis
bicarb has gradually trended downwards in the
   last 7 days since [**11-3**]. Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1. Lactate WNL (1.2).
   Ddx include bicarbonate loss [**12-19**] diarrhea (although not present
   significantly currently), volume resuscitation (although chloride is
   normal), and mixed acidosis
with pt
s LE ischemia, chronic respiratory
   acidosis, and septic physiology all contributing.
   - Will continue infectious w/u as above, Vanc/Cefepime, and stress dose
   steroids.
   - Will try to wean down pressors, to decrease LE ischemia
   - CVVH per renal
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase.
   - In order to improve kidney perfusion, pt will need to come off
   pressors (and will need to come down on AEDs before that).
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - Initiated on CVVH yesterday
   - Follow up renal recs
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively to maintain peripheral vascular
   tone and improve perfusion.
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Will restart heparin flushes and start pt on Lovenox once Qday, while
   closely monitoring PTT, Plt, and WBC daily.
   # Elevated PTT:  Likely due to use of Heparin SQ TID in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - Plan to restart Heparin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Follow PTT
   - Pneumoboots
   - Heparin SQ
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   # Leukocytosis
 resolved.
   Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas resistant to zosyn, sensitive to
   cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Per vascular surgery team, pt
s wound
   also grew out VRE from swab at OSH.  Most recent wound cxr growing
   Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), res to Meropenem, [**Last Name (un) 270**] to Cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime, Vanc
   - infectious w/u as above
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   # Systolic CHF
   - holding diuresis now given hypotension with lasix
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2 - cover with SSI.
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had recurrent episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The underlying cause seems to be hypoventilation, possibly due to myopathy and medication effects.

2. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has a history of bilateral below-knee amputations and is at risk for peripheral vascular disease. The note mentions the importance of maintaining a MAP (mean arterial pressure) greater than 70 to ensure adequate perfusion to the stump.

3. Status Epilepticus/Myoclonic Jerks: The patient experienced myoclonic jerks, which were initially treated with lorazepam. Subsequently, the patient was started on keppra (levetiracetam) and dilantin (phenytoin) for seizure control. EEG monitoring showed rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures.

4. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive on multiple occasions, particularly in the setting of diuretic use and phenobarbital loading. This may be related to medication sensitivity, and the note suggests that reducing AED dosing could help improve blood pressure control.

5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a gradually decreasing bicarbonate level, along with an elevated anion gap. The differential diagnosis includes bicarbonate loss (e.g., diarrhea), volume resuscitation, and mixed acid"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Per Neuro, no seizure since [**98**]:30 a.m. (this afternoon).  My read of
   EEG was beat rhythm consistent with some sedation, possibly due to
   Ativan (given for titibation - in future may use phenobarb because of
   prolonged benzo action in this patient).  Neuro want us to continue
   dilantin, Keppra, phenobarb (follow level [**Hospital1 7**] - is lost in CVVH - so
   will need higher dosing). Gave another bolus of 5mg/kg then will
   maintain with 75 mg TID.
   - Minimally responsive last night
   - Phosphate low again - gave two packets Neutraphos at 6:00 a.m. (did
   not want to push fluid for KPhos)
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be able to go to HD today - will help maintain phenobarb level

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   Details of decompensation unclear.  Pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy, and
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  Long term plan for tracheostomy. At this time will
   continue to wean pressure support.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb, follow VBGs
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - Long term plan for tracheostomy after discussion with family.
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks: Continued  HSV CSF PCR
   negative.  [**Male First Name (un) 561**] Negative. Varicella PCR negative.
   - FU Dilantin, Phenobarbital level this AM
   - Phenobarbital load 900 mg IV then 450 mg IV and maintenance @
        100 mg QID goal level 30
   -  Dilantin load 500 mg PO then 500 mg PO (AGAIN) and maintenance @
        300 mg TID for goal level 15-20
   - Now  on maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU Neuro Recs, re: Pentobarbital Coma
   - Transition to HD today, CVVH preventing higher drug levels AED
   # Leukocytosis: Increased white count today. On Vanc/Cefepime. CXR
   without obvious infiltrate. Sacral Decubitus to be examined.
   - Repeat blood cultures
   - UA/Urine Cx
   - Wound care/eval for infection
   - Repeat C. Diff.
   # Hypotension: Pressors restarted today after Phenobarbital load. Most
   likely secondary to drugs (AED, lasix, ativan)
   - Change stress-dosed steroids to (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was on
   prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Stop Lopressor (!)
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase. Off pressures.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - HD Saturday.
   - Follow up renal recs
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness. Pressures restarted today.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity. Continue to monitor.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Heparin [**Hospital1 7**] restarted
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   # Systolic CHF
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   - Length of stay volume up.
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2 - cover with SSI and long acting insulin. Adjust as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   Details of decompensation unclear.  Pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy, and
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  Long term plan for tracheostomy. At this time will
   continue to wean pressure support.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb, follow VBGs
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - Long term plan for tracheostomy after discussion with family.
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks: Continued  HSV CSF PCR

   -  Dilantin load 500 mg PO then 500 mg PO (AGAIN) and maintenance @
        300 mg TID for goal level 15-20
   - Now  on maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU Neuro Recs, re: Pentobarbital Coma
   - Transition to HD today, CVVH preventing higher drug levels AED
   # Leukocytosis: Increased white count today. On Vanc/Cefepime. CXR
   without obvious infiltrate.  Cdiff positive.
   - Repeat blood cultures
   - UA/Urine Cx
   - Wound care/eval for infection
   - Repeat C. Diff.
   # Hypotension: Pressors restarted today after Phenobarbital load. Most
   likely secondary to drugs (AED, lasix, ativan)
   - Change stress-dosed steroids to (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was on
   prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Stop Lopressor (!)
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase. Off pressures.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - HD Saturday.
   - Follow up renal recs
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness. Pressures restarted today.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity. Continue to monitor.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Heparin [**Hospital1 7**] restarted
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   # Systolic CHF
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   - Length of stay volume up.
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2 - cover with SSI and long acting insulin. Adjust as needed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA), with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post-dccvx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was extubated on 12/ but then had to be reintubated on 10/31 due to recurrent respiratory failure.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission, and ABG during the initial event was consistent with hypoventilation. Long-term plan for tracheostomy after discussion with the family. Currently, weaning pressure support, avoiding sedating medications, and monitoring VBGs to maintain PCO2 goal of 50.

2. Status Epilepticus/Myoclonic Jerks: HSV CSF PCR negative, [**Male First Name (un) 561**] negative, Varicella PCR negative. The patient is on maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]. FU Neuro Recs, re: Pentobarbital Coma.

3. Leukocytosis: Increased white count today. On Vanc/Cefepime. CXR without obvious infiltrate. Cdiff positive. Repeat blood cultures, UA/Urine Cx, wound care/"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, necrotizing myopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and status epilepticus. The patient's vital signs show hypoxia, hypotension, and tachycardia. His blood cultures and urine cultures are pending, and he has a positive Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. He is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, and cardiovascular drugs. The patient's family has made a do not resuscitate (DNR) decision.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation with hypercarbic respiratory failure and recurrent respiratory failure indicates a risk for ongoing respiratory compromise. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to hypoventilation and the presence of myopathy.
2. Status epilepticus: The patient's seizure activity suggests ongoing neurological impairment. Continuous monitoring and management of seizure control are necessary to prevent further episodes.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: The positive C. diff test indicates an infection that needs to be treated promptly to prevent complications such as pseudomembranous colitis or toxic megacolon.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's history of elevated creatinine levels, decreasing urine output, and findings of acute tubular necrosis on urinalysis indicate a risk for worsening renal function. Close monitoring and management are needed to prevent further kidney damage.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has trended down during hospitalization, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications. Monitoring platelet levels and considering transfusion if necessary are important to prevent bleeding events.
6. Anemia: The patient's chronic disease anemia requires ongoing management, particularly considering his need for blood transfusions.
7. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's history of bilateral below-knee amputations and wound infections indicate a risk for further complications related to poor peripheral circulation. Monitoring for signs of ischemia and providing appropriate wound care are crucial.

Please note that the patient's complex medical history and current ICU status make it challenging to predict the exact sequence and timing of potential complications. Close monitoring and individualized care are essential to manage these risks effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   Details of decompensation unclear.  Pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy,
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  Long unable to wean vent yesterday.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb, follow VBGs, attempt to wean FiO2
   if possible
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - hold on trach for now given hx of trach in the past and family
   expressing desire not to repeat trach/peg
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks: Continued  HSV CSF PCR
   negative.  [**Male First Name (un) 561**] Negative. Varicella PCR negative.  CVVHD now dc
d in
   attempt to increase levels of anti-seizure meds.
   - FU Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels
   - Phenobarbital load 900 mg IV then 450 mg IV and maintenance @
        100 mg QID goal level 30
   -  Dilantin load 500 mg PO then 500 mg PO (AGAIN) and maintenance @
        300 mg TID will need to redose today for goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU Neuro Recs
   - Plan for HD on saturday
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On
   Vanc/Cefepime. CXR without obvious infiltrate.  Cdiff positive.
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives
   - Wound care/eval for infection
   - Continue vancomycin for c. diff
   # Hypotension: Pressors restarted yesterday  after Phenobarbital load.
   Most likely secondary to drugs (AED, lasix, ativan)
   - Continue steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was on prednisone 5mg PO
   daily at home for necrotizing myopathy).
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase. Off pressures.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - HD Saturday.
   - Follow up renal recs
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness. Pressures restarted today.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will attempt to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s, now 80s.  There are multiple
   possible etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting
   of acute inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and
   a PPI).  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect inflammation or drug
   induced BM toxicity. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given crit 22.7, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   # Systolic CHF
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   - Length of stay volume up.
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies- no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2
 sugars stable.  Cover with SSI and long acting insulin. Adjust
   as needed.
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve both
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation).

","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post-dccv, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated during hospitalization but required re-intubation due to recurrent respiratory failure. 

Current Assessment:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is unable to wean off the ventilator, and his PCO2 goal is set at 50 to help retain bicarb. Sedating medications should be avoided, and cellcept (an immunosuppressant) and home prednisone should be continued.
2. Status Epilepticus/Myoclonic Jerks: The patient has been on HSV CSF PCR negative, and other anti-seizure medications are being continued. Dilantin and phenobarbital levels will be followed up.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis has improved since yesterday. He is on vancomycin and cefepime, and a wound care evaluation for infection is needed.
4. Hypotension: Pressors were restarted after phenobarbital loading. The patient may have drug-induced hypotension due to medications like AED, lasix, and ativan. Steroids and cellcept should be continued, and blood, urine cultures, and wound culture should be followed up.
5. Acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.  Continues to be difficult to manage
   given volume overloaded state, hypotension and seizure activity.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   Details of decompensation unclear.  Pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy,
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  Unable to wean vent yesterday.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb, follow VBGs, attempt to wean FiO2
   if possible, will otherwise maintain vent setting sfor now
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
) for treatment of MG
   - hold on trach for now given hx of trach in the past and family
   expressing desire not to repeat trach/peg

   - FU Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels
   - Phenobarbital load 900 mg IV then 450 mg IV and maintenance @
        100 mg QID goal level 30
   -  Dilantin load 500 mg PO then 500 mg PO (AGAIN) and maintenance @
        300 mg TID will need to redose today for goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU Neuro Recs
   - Plan for HD on Saturday, will dose seizure meds accordingly
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On
   Vanc/Cefepime. CXR with prominent R sided infiltrate.  Cdiff positive
   which is the most likely cause of leukocytosis at this time, therefore
   oral vanc started today ([**11-17**])
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives
   - F/u wound care recs regarding decub ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff
   # Hypotension: Pressors restarted yesterday after Phenobarbital load.
   Most likely secondary to drugs (AED, lasix, ativan).  Unable to wean
   overnight, however will continue to attempt to wean given dusky
   extremities, hx of vascular disease.
   - Continue stress dose steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was on
   prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy).
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine
   - holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NGTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has hx of elevated cr and decreasing UOP.
   Suspect ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show
   FeNa = 2, which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy
   brown casts in urine.  Now off of CVVHD.  Creatinine/electrolytes WNL
   today.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - HD Saturday.
   - Follow up renal recs
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness, duskiness.
   - Continue Cefepime/Vanc (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will attempt to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s, now 80s.  There are multiple
   possible etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting
   of acute inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and
   a PPI).  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect inflammation or drug
   induced BM toxicity. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions as outpatient.  1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given
   crit 22.7, and wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on
   exam.  On procrit as outpatient.  No evidence of hemolysis based on
   TBIL.
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   # Systolic CHF-significantly volume up this stay.
   - continue daily weights.
   - HD for fluid management
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies.  On
   cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with pt's
   neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
s seizures are part of
   this disease process.  S/p IVIGx 5 days.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2
 sugars stable.  Cover with SSI and long acting insulin. Adjust
   as needed.
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 65M severe PVD, myopathy, s/p RLE BKA c/b AF
   c RVR, respiratory failure [**12-19**] volume overload, ARF and nonconvulsant
   status epilepticus. CVVH held since yesterday to better optimize AEM.
   No evidence of  sz activity on eeg.  Remains volume
   overloaded, desaturating with turning, with PS increased 5-->14.  Neo
   and midodrine restarted for low MAPs.  C diff cx returned pos with
   PO vanco started this am.  Family mtg with code status now DNR.

   Agree with plan to manage MOSF with ongoing supportive care.  There
   is no current sz activity seen on bedside eeg.  We con't / adjust AEM
   as per neuro recommendations.  For refractory shock, he remains
   on pressors (neo)--we will try and wean, continuing midodrine and
   stress steroids at this time. Diarrhea losses further impact
   hypotension.  Will continue broad abx coverage with IV vanco / cefepime
   for resistant PSA wound infection / sepsis to complete a 3w course
   (started [**10-28**]).  Now also with c diff colitis, started
   on PO vanco.  For respiratory failure, will continue current vent
   settings--MMV w/ PSV (14/5), off sedation.  [**Month (only) 51**] attempt further wean
   when volume status better optimized. For ARF / ESRD,  would like to
   transition from CVVH to HD, but ongoing pressor requirement (and
   severe PVD) limit this. if not, will likely require CVVH, which will
   continue to interfere with AEM levels.  We continue ASA / plavix for
   PVD, amio for AF. For DM, will continue glargine and RISS. Access
   includes port, PICC, HD line. ICU: TF, SSI, sq hep. Pt is DNR.
   Continue to update wife.  Discussion ongoing regarding goals of
   care, with possible T+G and permanent HD cath next week if to continue
   current aggressive care. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), myopathy, and bilateral below-knee amputations. He was admitted for respiratory failure and was intubated. He has had multiple complications including hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure, status epilepticus, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation, continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH), and various pressors. His code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, medication side effects, or volume overload. Continued monitoring and adjustment of pressors will be necessary.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to hypoventilation, possibly caused by myopathy, medications, and obesity. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the patient's volume overload and respiratory muscle weakness.
3. Status epilepticus: The patient has had nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and anti-seizure medications are being administered. Continuous monitoring of the electroencephalogram (EEG) is recommended to assess seizure activity.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical complications and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is characterized by high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. The patient has a chronic metabolic alkalosis and hypoventilation, possibly caused by medications or myopathy. The ABG during the initial event showed hypoventilation, and the patient was unable to be weaned off the ventilator.

2. Status Epilepticus: The patient has been experiencing seizures, and various anti-seizure medications have been administered. The HSV CSF PCR was negative, indicating no herpes simplex virus infection. The patient's Dilantin and Phenobarbital levels need to be monitored, and additional doses will be given if necessary.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is an increased white blood cell count. The cause of leukocytosis could be due to Clostridium difficile infection, as the patient tested positive for C. diff. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime, and oral vancomycin has been started.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, requiring the use of pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. This could be secondary to medications (AED, lasix, ativan), among other factors. The patient is receiving stress dose steroids"

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post dorsal column catheterization, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was initially extubated but required reintubation due to recurrent respiratory failure.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a chronic metabolic alkalosis and is hypoventilating, leading to an increased PCO2 level. The goal is to maintain a PCO2 level of 50 to help retain bicarbonate and attempt to wean FiO2 if possible. Ventilator settings will be maintained for now, and sedating medications will be avoided.

2. Status Epilepticus/Myoclonic Jerks: The patient has been experiencing seizures, and HSV CSF PCR is negative. CVVHD has been discontinued to increase levels of anti-seizure medications. The plan includes checking Dilantin and Phenobarbital levels, loading with 900 mg of Phenobarbital IV, followed by maintenance at 100 mg QID with a goal level of 30. Dilantin will be loaded with 500 mg PO and then 500 mg PO (again) with maintenance at 300 mg TID, aiming for a goal level of 15-20. Keppra will be continued at 1500 mg.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which has improved since yesterday. The patient is on Vanc/Cefep"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   Details of decompensation unclear.  Pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy,
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  Long term plan for tracheostomy. At this time will
   continue to wean pressure support.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb, follow VBGs
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - Long term plan for tracheostomy after discussion with family.
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks: Continued  HSV CSF PCR
   negative.  [**Male First Name (un) 561**] Negative. Varicella PCR negative.  CVVHD now dc

   -  Dilantin load 500 mg PO then 500 mg PO (AGAIN) and maintenance @
        300 mg TID for goal level 15-20
   - Now  on maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU Neuro Recs, re: Pentobarbital Coma
   - Plan for HD on saturday
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On
   Vanc/Cefepime. CXR without obvious infiltrate.  Cdiff positive.
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives
   - Wound care/eval for infection
   - Continue vancomycin for c. diff
   # Hypotension: Pressors restarted yesterday  after Phenobarbital load.
   Most likely secondary to drugs (AED, lasix, ativan)
   - Continue steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was on prednisone 5mg PO
   daily at home for necrotizing myopathy).
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase. Off pressures.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - HD Saturday.
   - Follow up renal recs
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness. Pressures restarted today.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will attempt to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s, now 80s.  There are multiple
   possible etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting
   of acute inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and
   a PPI).  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect inflammation or drug
   induced BM toxicity. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given crit 22.7, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   # Systolic CHF
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   - Length of stay volume up.
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies- no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept

He was extubated on 12/1 but had to be reintubated on 10/31 due to recurrent respiratory failure.
- The patient has a chronic metabolic alkalosis, hypoventilation, myopathy, and is on multiple medications, making it difficult to determine the exact cause of his respiratory failure.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, and the plan is to continue weaning pressure support and perform tracheostomy after discussion with the family.
- The patient has been diagnosed with status epilepticus and myoclonic jerks, with negative HSV CSF PCR, Varicella PCR, and Male First Name (un) 561. CVVHD has been discontinued to increase levels of anti-seizure medications.
- The plan includes monitoring Dilantin and Phenobarbital levels, administering a phenobarbital load followed by maintenance, and starting Keppra.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which has improved since yesterday, and is being treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime. He also has Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive and is receiving appropriate antibiotics."

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   Details of decompensation unclear.  Pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy, and
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  Long term plan for tracheostomy. At this time will
   continue to wean pressure support.
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb, follow VBGs
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - Long term plan for tracheostomy after discussion with family.
   # Status Epilepticus / Myoclonic Jerks: Continued  HSV CSF PCR
   negative.  [**Male First Name (un) 561**] Negative. Varicella PCR negative.
   - FU Dilantin, Phenobarbital level this AM
   - Phenobarbital load 900 mg IV then 450 mg IV and maintenance @
        100 mg QID goal level 30
   -  Dilantin load 500 mg PO then 500 mg PO (AGAIN) and maintenance @
        300 mg TID for goal level 15-20
   - Now  on maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU Neuro Recs, re: Pentobarbital Coma
   - Transition to HD today, CVVH preventing higher drug levels AED
   # Leukocytosis: Increased white count today. On Vanc/Cefepime. CXR
   without obvious infiltrate. Sacral Decubitus to be examined.
   - Repeat blood cultures
   - UA/Urine Cx
   - Wound care/eval for infection
   - Repeat C. Diff.
   # Hypotension: Pressors restarted today after Phenobarbital load. Most
   likely secondary to drugs (AED, lasix, ativan)
   - Change stress-dosed steroids to (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was on
   prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4
   - Stop Lopressor (!)
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture
 negative so far. C.
   diff was negative x2.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has rising Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes. Urine lytes show FeNa = 2,
   which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts
   in urine. Pt is likely in oligouric phase. Off pressures.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxrs.
   - HD Saturday.
   - Follow up renal recs
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness. Pressures restarted today.
   - Continue Cefepime
   - Continue Vanc
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Vascular following and aware that pt
s L LE seems more grey and cold.
   Will follow up their recs
   - Will try to decrease pressors to improve peripheral perfusion, if
   possible
   Non-active/Stable issues:
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  During his hospitalization, the pt
s platelets
   trended down from 600s to low 100s.  There are multiple possible
   etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the setting of acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI),
   but will also evaluate for HIT by sending HIT antibodies.  Pt is high
   risk for HIT given timing of drop in platelets (6-10 days into hospital
   course), clinical setting, and history of heparin use in the past. He
   has no known thrombosis  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity. Continue to monitor.
   - HIT antibodies were negative.
   - Heparin [**Hospital1 7**] restarted
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions.  at present, bumped appropriately to 2U PRBC 24->30, and
   wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  on
   procrit as outpatient.  no evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.
   # CAD - continue aspirin, plavix.
   - f/u cardiology recs if any.
   # Systolic CHF
   - daily weights.
   - CVVH for fluid management
   - Length of stay volume up.
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies  - no
   evidence of myasthenic crisis presently (lifts heads, takes deep
   breath).  On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was
   previously held, but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after
   discussion with pt's neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
   seizures are part of this disease process.
   - continue steroids and cell-cept
   - s/p IVIG x 5 days
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2 - cover with SSI and long acting insulin. Adjust as needed.
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve both
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation).
   # Prophylaxis: PPI.

   management or clinical status.
   # Disposition: ICU for now, pending improved respiratory and mental
   status; pt
s wife would like him transferred.

            significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic
            (relapse).
   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.  Continues to be difficult to manage
   given volume overloaded state, hypotension and seizure activity.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   Pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD,
   OSA).  ABG during initial event consistent with hypoventilation
   (contributors include his myopathy, medications, though unclear if he
   received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  Difficult to wean
   previously and now with tube for more than two weeks, necessitating
   discussion of goals.  Can check NIF and then discuss with wife goals of
   care before trach route pursued (they have recently expressed
   reluctance). Likely contribution by encephalopathy.
   - Avoid additional sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone (stress dose)
   with weaning (if WBC less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
) for treatment of MG
   - Start to wean stress-dose steroids, but perhaps after dialysis given
   some possible hypotension
   - Hold on trach for now given hx of trach in the past and family
   expressing desire not to repeat trach/peg
   - Continue PSV 14/5 50% - could trial FiO2 40% given good O2 sats, but
   would check ABG first given difficulty of interpreting VBGs.
   # Mental Status / Status Epilepticus: EEG and clinical consistent with
   diffuse encephalopathy.  Etiology unclear, but status and mental status
   followed hypotensive episodes
 most likely hypoxic brain injury
   despite negative MRI previously.  CVVHD now dc
d in attempt to increase
   levels of anti-seizure meds (HD today). Dilantin low but patient
   elderly and albumin low. Phenobarb has been therapeutic. Will discuss
   f/u MRI w/ Neurology to help evaluate prognosis, or any other input
   from them on this.  Will help plan care and determine goals of care.
   - Follow Neuro recs for anticonvulsant dosing
   - Talk to Neuro about prognosis, possibility of hypoxic brain injury
   and repeat MRI
   - Follow Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels daily for now and in context of
   initiating HD
   - Phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Dilantin 300 mg TID will need to redose today for goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU Neuro Recs
   - HD today - will dose seizure meds accordingly (to levels and per
   Neuro)
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On
   Vanc/Cefepime. CXR with prominent R sided infiltrate.  Cdiff positive
   which is the most likely cause of leukocytosis at this time, therefore
   oral vanc started [**11-17**]
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives(three week
   course to end on [**2196-11-21**])
   - F/u wound care recs regarding decub ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff for two weeks after IV course
   completed
   # Hypotension: Pressors only midodrine now.
   - wean stress dose steroids after dialysis today (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr);
   pt was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy).
   Goal to keep above 90 mmHg systolic (MAP will be in 50s)
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine
   - holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NGTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has hx of elevated cr and decreasing UOP.
   Suspect ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes and no recovery
   patient essentially anuric at 67 mL in 24 hours. Also muddy brown casts
   in urine.  Now off of CVVHD.  Creatinine/electrolytes WNL, but HD to
   start today.  Renal goal is -2-3 L if pressure supports.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - HD today
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness, duskiness.
   - Continue Cefepime/Vanc (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Limit pressors to midodrine
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Stably low at 59 (near recent days but 80
   yesterday).  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on AEDs, Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI).  HIT antibodies were
   negative. Suspect inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity, now with
   potential contribution by phenytoin. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin today
 reevaluate in a.m. depending on next
   platelet count.
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions as outpatient.  1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given
   crit 22.7, and wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on
   exam.  On procrit as outpatient.  No evidence of hemolysis based on
   TBIL.  Not evidently septic physiology at present, but may consider
   transfusion if lowering given near 21.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # CAD
   - continue aspirin, plavix.
   # Systolic CHF-significantly volume up this stay.
   - Continue daily weights.
   - HD for fluid management
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies.  On
   cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with pt's
   neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
s seizures are part of
   this disease process.  S/p IVIGx 5 days.
   - continue steroids (reducing from stress dose after dialysis) and
   cell-cept
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2
 sugars stable.  Cover with SSI (increased scale yesterday) and
   long acting insulin. Adjust as needed.
   - Follow when taking off stress-dose steroids.
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve both
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation).
   # Prophylaxis: PPI.
   # Code:  DNR/DNI
   # Communication: Patient, wife [**Name (NI) 4617**] (cell) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12121**], (home)
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12122**]; will be sure to update her with any changes in patient
   management or clinical status.
   # Disposition: ICU for now, pending improved respiratory and mental
   status; pt
s wife would like him transferred.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted for a right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA), with a course complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) after direct current cardioversion (DCCV), hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was initially extubated during hospitalization but had to be reintubated due to recurrent respiratory failure. The patient remains difficult to manage with volume overload, hypotension, and seizure activity.

The patient has a history of chronic metabolic alkalosis, hypoventilation, myopathy, and medications contributing to the respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (MMV/PSV/AutoFlow), with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred to ventilator dependence.

The patient has leukocytosis, which has improved since yesterday, and is being treated with vancomycin (Vanc) and cefepime (Cefepime). The patient has a positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin, likely causing the leukocytosis. Oral vancomycin has been started.

The patient also has hypotension, requiring pressors, specifically midodrine. The goal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for a below-knee amputation on the right lower extremity. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was initially extubated but required re-intubation due to recurrent respiratory failure. The patient remains difficult to manage due to volume overload, hypotension, and seizure activity.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, status epilepticus, leukocytosis, hypotension, acute renal failure, peripheral vascular disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, chronic disease, coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, necrotizing myopathy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 2, and familial endometrial necrosis.

The patient's current medications include Cellcept, prednisone, hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, dilantin, phenobarbital, keppra, vancomycin, cefepime, and heparin. The patient's labs show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and low platelets. The patient's imaging shows pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

            A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
   uncertain
            significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic
            (relapse).
   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.  Continues to be difficult to manage
   given volume overloaded state, hypotension and seizure activity.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   Pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD,
   OSA).  ABG during initial event consistent with hypoventilation
   (contributors include his myopathy, medications, though unclear if he
   received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  Difficult to wean
   previously and now with tube for more than two weeks, necessitating
   discussion of goals.  Can check NIF and then discuss with wife goals of
   care before trach route pursued (they have recently expressed
   reluctance). Likely contribution by encephalopathy.
   - Avoid additional sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone (stress dose)
   with weaning (if WBC less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
) for treatment of MG
   - Start to wean stress-dose steroids, but perhaps after dialysis given
   some possible hypotension
   - Hold on trach for now given hx of trach in the past and family
   expressing desire not to repeat trach/peg
   - Continue PSV 14/5 50% - could trial FiO2 40% given good O2 sats, but
   would check ABG first given difficulty of interpreting VBGs.
   # Mental Status / Status Epilepticus: EEG and clinical consistent with
   diffuse encephalopathy.  Etiology unclear, but status and mental status
   followed hypotensive episodes
 most likely hypoxic brain injury
   despite negative MRI previously.  CVVHD now dc
d in attempt to increase
   levels of anti-seizure meds (HD today). Dilantin low but patient
   elderly and albumin low. Phenobarb has been therapeutic. Will discuss
   f/u MRI w/ Neurology to help evaluate prognosis, or any other input
   from them on this.  Will help plan care and determine goals of care.
   - Follow Neuro recs for anticonvulsant dosing
   - Talk to Neuro about prognosis, possibility of hypoxic brain injury
   and repeat MRI
   - Follow Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels daily for now and in context of
   initiating HD
   - Phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Dilantin 300 mg TID will need to redose today for goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU Neuro Recs
   - HD today - will dose seizure meds accordingly (to levels and per
   Neuro)
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On
   Vanc/Cefepime. CXR with prominent R sided infiltrate.  Cdiff positive
   which is the most likely cause of leukocytosis at this time, therefore
   oral vanc started [**11-17**]
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives(three week
   course to end on [**2196-11-21**])
   - F/u wound care recs regarding decub ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff for two weeks after IV course
   completed
   # Hypotension: Pressors only midodrine now.
   - wean stress dose steroids after dialysis today (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr);
   pt was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy).
   Goal to keep above 90 mmHg systolic (MAP will be in 50s)
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine
   - holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NGTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has hx of elevated cr and decreasing UOP.
   Suspect ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes and no recovery
   patient essentially anuric at 67 mL in 24 hours. Also muddy brown casts
   in urine.  Now off of CVVHD.  Creatinine/electrolytes WNL, but HD to
   start today.  Renal goal is -2-3 L if pressure supports.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - HD today
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness, duskiness.
   - Continue Cefepime/Vanc (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Limit pressors to midodrine
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Stably low at 59 (near recent days but 80
   yesterday).  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on AEDs, Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI).  HIT antibodies were
   negative. Suspect inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity, now with
   potential contribution by phenytoin. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin today
 reevaluate in a.m. depending on next
   platelet count.
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions as outpatient.  1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given
   crit 22.7, and wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on
   exam.  On procrit as outpatient.  No evidence of hemolysis based on
   TBIL.  Not evidently septic physiology at present, but may consider
   transfusion if lowering given near 21.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # CAD
   - continue aspirin, plavix.
   # Systolic CHF-significantly volume up this stay.
   - Continue daily weights.
   - HD for fluid management
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies.  On
   cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with pt's
   neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
s seizures are part of
   this disease process.  S/p IVIGx 5 days.
   - continue steroids (reducing from stress dose after dialysis) and
   cell-cept
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2
 sugars stable.  Cover with SSI (increased scale yesterday) and

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 65M severe PVD, myopathy, s/p RLE BKA c/b AF
   c RVR, respiratory failure [**12-19**] volume overload, ARF and nonconvulsant
   status epilepticus. No evidence of ongoing szs on bedside eeg X > 24
   hrs.  Remains unresponsive. Weaned off neo yesterday.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.7 BP 115/53 HR 82  AF RR 20 with sat 99% on PSV

   7.27/54
   Agree with plan to manage MOSF with ongoing supportive care.  There
   is no current sz activity seen on bedside eeg but he remains
   unresponsive with diffuse slowing on eeg.  Suspect some component of
   anoxic injury. We continue his current AEM,  adjusting per neuro
   recs. Consider repeating MRI.  His hypotension has resolved and he is
   now off neo.  Diarrhea losses likely contributed.  We continue
   midodrine and stress steroids at this time.  Will taper to home
   dose once off pressors X 48 hrs.  Will continue broad abx coverage
   with IV vanco / cefepime for resistant PSA wound infection / sepsis to
   complete a 3w course (started [**10-28**]).  On day 2 PO vanco for c diff.
   For respiratory failure, will continue current vent settings--MMV
   w/ PSV (14/5), off sedation. Will check NIF as deconditioning and
   weakness likely contributing to his FTW.  For ARF / ESRD,  plan
   to initate HD today.  We continue ASA / plavix for PVD, amio for AF.
   For DM, will continue glargine and RISS. Access includes port, PICC, HD
   line. ICU: TF, SSI, PPI, sq hep. Pt is DNR.  Discussion ongoing
   regarding goals of care, with possible T+G and permanent HD cath next
   week if to continue current aggressive care. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of right lower extremity below-knee amputation (BKA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), myopathy, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted for respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), and status epilepticus. 

The patient has a complex medical history, including chronic disease anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, and necrotizing myopathy with a history of myasthenia gravis. He has been treated with multiple medications, including antibiotics, antiepileptics, steroids, and others.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing respiratory failure, mental status changes, and seizures. He remains unresponsive with diffuse slowing on EEG. His vital signs are stable, but he has been hypotensive, requiring pressor support. He also has leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

The plan includes aggressive supportive care, including ongoing ventilatory support, hemodialysis, and seizure management. The patient's wife has expressed reluctance for a tracheostomy, so the decision regarding this procedure is pending further discussion. The patient's code status is full code.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.  Continues to be difficult to manage
   given volume overloaded state, hypotension and seizure activity.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   Pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD,
   OSA).  ABG during initial event consistent with hypoventilation
   (contributors include his myopathy, medications, though unclear if he
   received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  Difficult to wean
   previously and now with tube for more than two weeks, necessitating
   discussion of goals.  Can check NIF and then discuss with wife goals of
   care before trach route pursued (they have recently expressed
   reluctance). Likely contribution by encephalopathy.
   - Avoid additional sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone (stress dose)
   with weaning (if WBC less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
) for treatment of MG
   - Start to wean stress-dose steroids, but perhaps after dialysis given
   some possible hypotension
   - Hold on trach for now given hx of trach in the past and family
   expressing desire not to repeat trach/peg
   - Continue PSV 14/5 50% - could trial FiO2 40% given good O2 sats, but
   would check ABG first given difficulty of interpreting VBGs.
   .
   # Mental Status / Status Epilepticus: EEG and clinical consistent with
   diffuse encephalopathy.  Etiology unclear, but status and mental status
   followed hypotensive episodes
 most likely hypoxic brain injury
   despite negative MRI previously.  CVVHD now dc
d in attempt to increase
   levels of anti-seizure meds (HD today). Dilantin low but patient
   elderly and albumin low. Phenobarb has been therapeutic. Will discuss
   f/u MRI w/ Neurology to help evaluate prognosis, or any other input
   from them on this.  Will help plan care and determine goals of care.
   - Follow Neuro recs for anticonvulsant dosing
   - Talk to Neuro about prognosis, possibility of hypoxic brain injury
   and repeat MRI
   - Follow Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels daily for now and in context of
   initiating HD
   - Phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Dilantin 300 mg TID will need to redose today for goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - FU Neuro Recs
   - HD today - will dose seizure meds accordingly (to levels and per
   Neuro)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On
   Vanc/Cefepime. CXR with prominent R sided infiltrate.  Cdiff positive
   which is the most likely cause of leukocytosis at this time, therefore
   oral vanc started [**11-17**]
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives(three week
   course to end on [**2196-11-21**])
   - F/u wound care recs regarding decub ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff for two weeks after IV course
   completed
   .
   # Hypotension: Pressors only midodrine now.
   - wean stress dose steroids after dialysis today (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr);
   pt was on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy).
   Goal to keep above 90 mmHg systolic (MAP will be in 50s)
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine
   - holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NGTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has hx of elevated cr and decreasing UOP.
   Suspect ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes and no recovery
   patient essentially anuric at 67 mL in 24 hours. Also muddy brown casts
   in urine.  Now off of CVVHD.  Creatinine/electrolytes WNL, but HD to
   start today.  Renal goal is -2-3 L if pressure supports.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - HD today
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness, duskiness.
   - Continue Cefepime/Vanc (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Limit pressors to midodrine
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Stably low at 59 (near recent days but 80
   yesterday).  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on AEDs, Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI).  HIT antibodies were
   negative. Suspect inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity, now with
   potential contribution by phenytoin. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin today
 reevaluate in a.m. depending on next
   platelet count.
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   .
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions as outpatient.  1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given
   crit 22.7, and wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on
   exam.  On procrit as outpatient.  No evidence of hemolysis based on
   TBIL.  Not evidently septic physiology at present, but may consider
   transfusion if lowering given near 21.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   .
   # CAD
   - continue aspirin, plavix.
   # Systolic CHF-significantly volume up this stay.
   - Continue daily weights.
   - HD for fluid management
   .
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies.  On
   cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with pt's
   neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
s seizures are part of
   this disease process.  S/p IVIGx 5 days.
   - continue steroids (reducing from stress dose after dialysis) and
   cell-cept
   .
   # GERD
 on PPI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   .
   # DM2
 sugars stable.  Cover with SSI (increased scale yesterday) and
   long acting insulin. Adjust as needed.
   - Follow when taking off stress-dose steroids.
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve both
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation).
   # Prophylaxis: PPI.
   # Code:  DNR/DNI
   # Communication: Patient, wife [**Name (NI) 4617**] (cell) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12121**], (home)
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12122**]; will be sure to update her with any changes in patient
   management or clinical status.
   # Disposition: ICU for now, pending improved respiratory and mental
   status; pt
s wife would like him transferred.
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and subsequent hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was intubated but extubated during hospitalization and then re-intubated due to recurrent respiratory failure. The patient has a history of myasthenia gravis, necrotizing myopathy, peripheral vascular disease with wound infection, and chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis. He also has leukocytosis, hypotension, mental status changes, and status epilepticus. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, and seizure activity. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a history of recurrent respiratory failure, indicating a potential risk for continued respiratory compromise.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating a risk for further hypotensive episodes and potential organ damage.
3. Status epilepticus: The patient is experiencing ongoing seizure activity, which requires close monitoring and management to prevent further seizures and associated complications.
4. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and a history of wound infection, suggesting a risk for ongoing or recurrent infections.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently anuric, indicating a risk for worsening renal function and potential"

   Microbiology: None new
   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.  Continues to be difficult to manage
   given volume overloaded state, hypotension and seizure activity.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy,
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  Difficult to wean previously and now with tube for more
   than two weeks, necessitating discussion of goals of care.  Likely
   contribution from encephalopathy.
   - Avoid additional sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept and prednisone (stress dose) for treatment of
   necrotizing myopathy
   - would like to wean stress-dose steroids, but will hold for now given
   hypotension overnight.
   - Need to re-address Goals of care with family (and likely need for
   trach/peg), given pt
s prolonged intubation and extubation failure x 2.
   - Continue current vent settings for now
   .
   # Mental Status / Status Epilepticus: EEG and clinical consistent with
   diffuse encephalopathy.  Etiology unclear, but status and mental status
   followed hypotensive episodes
 most likely hypoxic brain injury
   despite negative MRI previously.
   - Follow Neuro recs for anticonvulsant dosing (no changes for now)
   - Per neuro weekend coverage, no indication for repeat MRI for
   prognostic purposes presently; can re-address with regular neuro team
   on Monday.
   - Follow Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels daily for now and in context of
   initiating HD
   - Phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Dilantin 300 mg TIDl, goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypotension: Now on Midodrine and Neo. Likely due to fluid shifts in
   the setting of HD initiation yesterday. No increase in WBC or fever to
   suggest septic etiology.  No change in respiratory status
no increased
   O2 requirement, or change in secretions
to suggest VAP.  Also no
   obvious bleeding or decrease in HCT to suggest acute blood loss.
   - Try to wean Neo today. Goal to keep above 90 mmHg systolic (MAP will
   be in 50s).
   - Continue midodrine.
   - Continue stress dose today (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was chronically
   on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy and will
   need a very slow taper when hypotension resolved.
   - Will wean AEDs as recommended by Neuro.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine
   - holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NGTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has elevated Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes and muddy brown casts in
   urine
 patient continues to be essentially anuric at 60 mL in 24
   hours.  Creatinine/electrolytes WNL, no change in volume/respiratory
   status, so no indications for emergent HD currently.  Patient received
   2hrs of HD yesterday ([**11-18**]). Current issue is mainly pt
s lack of
   access for HD given that his temporary HD line has now clotted off.
   - Need to address need for new HD access with family.  If pt is to
   continue on long-term dialysis, will need more permanent access.
   - Follow up renal recs. HD per renal and access.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - Daily lytes.
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness, duskiness.
   - Continue Cefepime/Vanc (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Try to wean off Neo as tolerated.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On
   Vanc/Cefepime/PO vanc. Improving with C. Diff treatment.
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives(three week
   course to end on [**2196-11-21**])
   - F/u wound care recs regarding decub ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff for two weeks after IV course
   completed
   .
   Less active issues
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Stably low at 59 (near recent days but 80
   yesterday).  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on AEDs, Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI).  HIT antibodies were
   negative. Suspect inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity, now with
   potential contribution by phenytoin. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin today
 reevaluate in a.m. depending on next
   platelet count.
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   .
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions as outpatient.  1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given
   crit 22.7, and wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on
   exam.  On procrit as outpatient.  No evidence of hemolysis based on
   TBIL.  Not evidently septic physiology at present, but may consider
   transfusion if lowering given near 21.
   - Maintain active type and screen (last sent [**11-17**])
   .
   # CAD
   - continue aspirin, plavix.
   # Systolic CHF-significantly volume up this stay.
   - Continue daily weights.
   - HD for fluid management per renal
   .
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies.  On
   cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with pt's
   neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
s seizures are part of
   this disease process.  S/p IVIGx 5 days.
   - continue steroids (reducing from stress dose after dialysis
   initiation) and cell-cept
   .
   # GERD
 on PPI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   .
   # DM2
 sugars stable.  Cover with SSI (increased scale yesterday) and
   long acting insulin. Adjust as needed.
   - Follow when weaning stress-dose steroids.
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve both
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation).
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Heparin SQ [**Hospital1 7**].
   # Code:  DNR/DNI
   # Communication: Patient, wife [**Name (NI) 4617**] (cell) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12121**], (home)
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12122**]; will be sure to update her with any changes in patient
   management or clinical status.
   # Disposition: ICU for now, pending improved respiratory and mental
   status.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 65M severe PVD, myopathy, s/p RLE BKA c/b AF
   c RVR, respiratory failure [**12-19**] volume overload, ARF and nonconvulsant
   status epilepticus. No evidence of ongoing szs on bedside eeg.  Remains
   unresponsive. Tolerated HD yesterday with 1.5L off.  HD line then
   stopped functioning.  Hypotensive late in night--did not imrpove after
   500cc bolus. Placed back on neo gtt.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.9  BP 99/44  HR 70  AF RR 10 with sat 99%
   on MMV-PSV 14/5  0.5.  Opens eyes spontaneously, but does not interact
   or follow commands, coarse bs b. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 4+ edema, BLE
   amputations--L stump remains dusky, cool distal ext unchanged.
   Labs notable for WBC 9.9, HCT 24, plt 72, K+ 5.0. cr 1.0, bun 54
   CXR--et low, b/l effusions layering, without sig change given change in
   penetration
   Agree with plan to manage MOSF with ongoing supportive care.  There
   is no current sz activity seen on bedside eeg but he remains
   unresponsive with diffuse slowing on eeg.  Suspect component of anoxic
   injury. We continue his current AED,  following levels, adjusting
   per neuro recs, will likely tapering AED in next few days. Will d/w
   neuro team utility in repeating MRI as unlikely to change current
   management.  He is back on pressors (neo) following HD run--likely from
   volume shifts.  He remains AF (on steroids) and with
   improving leukocytosis, will wean neo for MAP > 60, sys > 90.  We
   continue midodrine and stress steroids at this time.  Will taper to
   home steroid dose once off pressors X 48 hrs.  Will continue broad abx
   coverage with IV vanco / cefepime for resistant PSA wound infection /
   sepsis to complete a 3w course (started [**10-28**]).  On day 2 PO vanco for
   c diff.  For respiratory failure, will continue current vent
   settings--MMV w/ PSV (14/5), has he has failed extubation X 2 and has
   frequent apneic episodes. Will check NIF as weakness likely
   contributing to his FTW.  For ARF / ESRD,  HD as per renal schedule,
   though HD access needs to be clarified (repeat temp line vs
   tunnel).  We continue ASA / plavix for PVD, amio for AF. For DM, will
   continue glargine and RISS. Access includes port, PICC/port, HD line.
   ICU: TF, SSI, PPI, sq hep. Pt is DNR.  Discussion ongoing regarding
   goals of care, with possible T+G and permanent HD cath early next week.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","The patient's chief complaint includes respiratory failure, status epilepticus, necrotizing myopathy, and peripheral vascular disease with wound infection. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was previously admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypotension. The patient has a history of necrotizing myopathy and is on immunosuppressive therapy. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 100/34 mmHg (81/32-122/53 mmHg), respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, regular rapid heart rate, obesity with soft non-distended abdomen, and bilateral amputations with the left stump remaining cool and dusky.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.8 x 10^9/L, elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and a platelet count of 44 x 10^9/L. The patient's urine output is low at 60 mL in 24 hours, and the chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural"

   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.  Continues to be difficult to manage
   given volume overloaded state, hypotension and seizure activity.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy,
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  Difficult to wean previously and now with tube for more
   than two weeks, necessitating discussion of goals of care.  Likely
   contribution from encephalopathy.
   - Avoid additional sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept and prednisone (stress dose) for treatment of
   necrotizing myopathy
   - would like to wean stress-dose steroids, but will hold for now given
   hypotension overnight.
   - Need to re-address Goals of care with family (and likely need for
   trach/peg), given pt
s prolonged intubation and extubation failure x 2.
   - Continue current vent settings for now
   .
   # Mental Status / Status Epilepticus: EEG and clinical consistent with
   diffuse encephalopathy.  Etiology unclear, but status and mental status
   followed hypotensive episodes
 most likely hypoxic brain injury
   despite negative MRI previously.
   - Follow Neuro recs for anticonvulsant dosing (no changes for now)
   - Per neuro weekend coverage, no indication for repeat MRI for
   prognostic purposes presently; can re-address with regular neuro team
   on Monday.
   - Follow Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels daily for now and in context of
   initiating HD
   - Phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Dilantin 300 mg TIDl, goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypotension: Now on Midodrine and Neo. Likely due to fluid shifts in
   the setting of HD initiation yesterday. No increase in WBC or fever to
   suggest septic etiology.  No change in respiratory status
no increased
   O2 requirement, or change in secretions
to suggest VAP.  Also no
   obvious bleeding or decrease in HCT to suggest acute blood loss.
   - Try to wean Neo today. Goal to keep above 90 mmHg systolic (MAP will
   be in 50s).
   - Continue midodrine.
   - Continue stress dose today (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was chronically
   on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy and will
   need a very slow taper when hypotension resolved.
   - Will wean AEDs as recommended by Neuro.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine
   - holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NGTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has elevated Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes and muddy brown casts in
   urine
 patient continues to be essentially anuric at 60 mL in 24
   hours.  Creatinine/electrolytes WNL, no change in volume/respiratory
   status, so no indications for emergent HD currently.  Patient received
   2hrs of HD yesterday ([**11-18**]). Current issue is mainly pt
s lack of
   access for HD given that his temporary HD line has now clotted off.
   - Need to address need for new HD access with family.  If pt is to
   continue on long-term dialysis, will need more permanent access.
   - Follow up renal recs. HD per renal and access.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - Daily lytes.
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness, duskiness.
   - Continue Cefepime/Vanc (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Try to wean off Neo as tolerated.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On
   Vanc/Cefepime/PO vanc. Improving with C. Diff treatment.
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives(three week
   course to end on [**2196-11-21**])
   - F/u wound care recs regarding decub ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff for two weeks after IV course
   completed
   .
   Less active issues
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Stably low at 59 (near recent days but 80
   yesterday).  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on AEDs, Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI).  HIT antibodies were
   negative. Suspect inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity, now with
   potential contribution by phenytoin. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin today
 reevaluate in a.m. depending on next
   platelet count.
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   .
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions as outpatient.  1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given
   crit 22.7, and wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on
   exam.  On procrit as outpatient.  No evidence of hemolysis based on
   TBIL.  Not evidently septic physiology at present, but may consider
   transfusion if lowering given near 21.
   - Maintain active type and screen (last sent [**11-17**])
   .
   # CAD
   - continue aspirin, plavix.
   # Systolic CHF-significantly volume up this stay.
   - Continue daily weights.
   - HD for fluid management per renal
   .
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies.  On
   cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with pt's
   neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
s seizures are part of
   this disease process.  S/p IVIGx 5 days.
   - continue steroids (reducing from stress dose after dialysis
   initiation) and cell-cept
   .
   # GERD
 on PPI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   .
   # DM2
 sugars stable.  Cover with SSI (increased scale yesterday) and
   long acting insulin. Adjust as needed.
   - Follow when weaning stress-dose steroids.
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve both
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation).
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Heparin SQ [**Hospital1 7**].
   # Code:  DNR/DNI
   # Communication: Patient, wife [**Name (NI) 4617**] (cell) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12121**], (home)

   management or clinical status.
   # Disposition: ICU for now, pending improved respiratory and mental
   status.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, necrotizing myopathy, status post bilateral below-knee amputations, and peripheral vascular disease with a wound infection. He was admitted for respiratory failure, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient had a previous episode of intubation and extubation failure and is currently intubated. He also has a history of seizures and is on antiepileptic drugs.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 100/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is hemodynamically unstable, requiring pressor support with phenylephrine. Fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,032 mL since the last measurement.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels, while platelet count is low. The patient has metabolic alkalosis and anemia. Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's chronic metabolic alkalosis may be contributing to hypoventilation. It is important to avoid additional sedating medications, continue cellcept and prednisone, and discuss tracheostomy"

3. Hypotension: Stable. Likely [12/19] fluid shifts in the setting of HD. Less likely sepsis as no leukocytosis/fever. Less likely blood loss as Hct stable. Less likely VAP as no change in respiratory status.
4. Acute renal failure: Stable Cr at 1.4, stable anuria at 75mL in 24 hours. Likely ATN given patient's recent hypotensive episodes and muddy brown casts in urine.
5. PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
6. Leukocytosis: Resolving. On vancomycin (IV/PO)/cefepime. Improving with c. diff treatment.
7. Anemia, chronic disease: Stable, down trending and resolve with blood transfusion. Per wife, receives chronic blood transfusions as outpatient. No evidence of bleed, hemolysis.
8. Thrombocytopenia: Stable, low at 89 but stable. Etiologies include bone marrow suppression, acute inflammation, drug adverse effect; HIT antibodies negative.
9. CAD: Continue aspirin, plavix.
10. Systolic CHF: Continue daily weights. Continue HD fluid management per renal.
11. Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies: On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient. Cellcept was previously held, but resumed during last admission to [Hospital1 19] after discussion with patient's neurologist. Neurologist does not think that patient seizures are part of this disease process. S/p IVIG x 5 days.
12. GERDL: Continue PPI.
13. Hypothyroidism: Continue synth"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.  Continues to be difficult to manage
   given volume overloaded state, hypotension and seizure activity.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Pt has a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during initial event
   consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his myopathy,
   medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram prior to
   intubation).  Difficult to wean previously and now with tube for more
   than two weeks, necessitating discussion of goals of care.  Likely
   contribution from encephalopathy.
   - Avoid additional sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept and prednisone (stress dose) for treatment of
   necrotizing myopathy
   - would like to wean stress-dose steroids, but will hold for now given
   hypotension overnight.
   - Need to re-address Goals of care with family (and likely need for
   trach/peg), given pt
s prolonged intubation and extubation failure x 2.
   - Continue current vent settings for now
   .
   # Mental Status / Status Epilepticus: EEG and clinical consistent with
   diffuse encephalopathy.  Etiology unclear, but status and mental status
   followed hypotensive episodes
 most likely hypoxic brain injury
   despite negative MRI previously.
   - Follow Neuro recs for anticonvulsant dosing (no changes for now)
   - Per neuro weekend coverage, no indication for repeat MRI for
   prognostic purposes presently; can re-address with regular neuro team
   on Monday.
   - Follow Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels daily for now and in context of
   initiating HD
   - Phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Dilantin 300 mg TIDl, goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypotension: Now on Midodrine and Neo. Likely due to fluid shifts in
   the setting of HD initiation yesterday. No increase in WBC or fever to
   suggest septic etiology.  No change in respiratory status
no increased
   O2 requirement, or change in secretions
to suggest VAP.  Also no
   obvious bleeding or decrease in HCT to suggest acute blood loss.
   - Try to wean Neo today. Goal to keep above 90 mmHg systolic (MAP will
   be in 50s).
   - Continue midodrine.
   - Continue stress dose today (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was chronically
   on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy and will
   need a very slow taper when hypotension resolved.
   - Will wean AEDs as recommended by Neuro.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine
   - holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NGTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has elevated Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect
   ATN, given pt
s recent hypotensive episodes and muddy brown casts in
   urine
 patient continues to be essentially anuric at 60 mL in 24
   hours.  Creatinine/electrolytes WNL, no change in volume/respiratory
   status, so no indications for emergent HD currently.  Patient received
   2hrs of HD yesterday ([**11-18**]). Current issue is mainly pt
s lack of
   access for HD given that his temporary HD line has now clotted off.
   - Need to address need for new HD access with family.  If pt is to
   continue on long-term dialysis, will need more permanent access.
   - Follow up renal recs. HD per renal and access.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - Daily lytes.
   .
   # PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA.
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness, duskiness.
   - Continue Cefepime/Vanc (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Try to wean off Neo as tolerated.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On
   Vanc/Cefepime/PO vanc. Improving with C. Diff treatment.
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives(three week
   course to end on [**2196-11-21**])
   - F/u wound care recs regarding decub ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff for two weeks after IV course
   completed
   .
   Less active issues
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Stably low at 59 (near recent days but 80
   yesterday).  There are multiple possible etiologies, including bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse
   effect (pt is on AEDs, Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI).  HIT antibodies were
   negative. Suspect inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity, now with
   potential contribution by phenytoin. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin today
 reevaluate in a.m. depending on next
   platelet count.
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   .
   # Anemia, chronic disease - per wife, receives chronic blood
   transfusions as outpatient.  1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given
   crit 22.7, and wound site c/d/i, no evidence of compartment syndrome on
   exam.  On procrit as outpatient.  No evidence of hemolysis based on
   TBIL.  Not evidently septic physiology at present, but may consider
   transfusion if lowering given near 21.
   - Maintain active type and screen (last sent [**11-17**])
   .
   # CAD
   - continue aspirin, plavix.
   # Systolic CHF-significantly volume up this stay.
   - Continue daily weights.
   - HD for fluid management per renal
   .
   # Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies.  On
   cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with pt's
   neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
s seizures are part of
   this disease process.  S/p IVIGx 5 days.
   - continue steroids (reducing from stress dose after dialysis
   initiation) and cell-cept
   .
   # GERD
 on PPI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   .
   # DM2
 sugars stable.  Cover with SSI (increased scale yesterday) and
   long acting insulin. Adjust as needed.
   - Follow when weaning stress-dose steroids.
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve both
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation).
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Heparin SQ [**Hospital1 7**].
   # Code:  DNR/DNI
   # Communication: Patient, wife [**Name (NI) 4617**] (cell) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12121**], (home)
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12122**]; will be sure to update her with any changes in patient
   management or clinical status.
   # Disposition: ICU for now, pending improved respiratory and mental
   status.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.  Continues to be difficult to manage
   given volume overloaded state, hypotension and seizure activity.
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD,
   OSA).  ABG during initial event consistent with hypoventilation
   (contributors include his myopathy, medications, though unclear if he
   received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  Difficult to wean
   previously and now with tube for more than two weeks, necessitating
   discussion of goals of care.  Likely contribution from encephalopathy.
   - Avoid additional sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept and prednisone (stress dose) for treatment of
   necrotizing myopathy
   - Would like to wean stress-dose steroids, but will hold for now given
   hypotension overnight.
   - Need to re-address Goals of care with family (and likely need for
   trach/peg), given pt
s prolonged intubation and extubation failure x 2.
   - Continue current vent settings for now
   Mental Status / Status Epilepticus
   EEG and clinical consistent with diffuse encephalopathy.  Etiology
   unclear, but status and mental status followed hypotensive episodes
   most likely hypoxic brain injury despite negative MRI previously.
   - Follow Neuro recs for anticonvulsant dosing (no changes for now)
   - Per neuro weekend coverage, no indication for repeat MRI for
   prognostic purposes presently; can re-address with regular neuro team
   on Monday.
   - Follow Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels daily for now and in context of
   initiating HD
   - Phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Dilantin 300 mg TIDl, goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypotension
   Now on Midodrine and Neo. Likely due to fluid shifts in the setting of
   HD initiation yesterday. No increase in WBC or fever to suggest septic
   etiology.  No change in respiratory status
no increased O2 requirement,
   or change in secretions
to suggest VAP.  Also no obvious bleeding or
   decrease in HCT to suggest acute blood loss.
   - Try to wean Neo today. Goal to keep above 90 mmHg systolic (MAP will
   be in 50s).
   - Continue midodrine.
   - Continue stress dose today (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was chronically
   on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy and will
   need a very slow taper when hypotension resolved.
   - Will wean AEDs as recommended by Neuro.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine
   - Holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NGTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   Acute renal failure
   Pt has elevated Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect ATN, given pt
s recent
   hypotensive episodes and muddy brown casts in urine
 patient continues
   to be essentially anuric at 60 mL in 24 hours.  Creatinine/electrolytes
   WNL, no change in volume/respiratory status, so no indications for
   emergent HD currently.  Patient received 2hrs of HD yesterday ([**11-18**]).
   Current issue is mainly pt
s lack of access for HD given that his
   temporary HD line has now clotted off.
   - Need to address need for new HD access with family.  If pt is to
   continue on long-term dialysis, will need more permanent access.
   - Follow up renal recs. HD per renal and access.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - Daily lytes.
   PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness, duskiness.
   - Continue Cefepime/Vanc (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Try to wean off Neo as tolerated.
   Leukocytosis
   Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On Vanc/Cefepime/PO vanc.
   Improving with C. Diff treatment.
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives(three week
   course to end on [**2196-11-21**])
   - F/u wound care recs regarding decub ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff for two weeks after IV course
   completed
   Thrombocytopenia
   Stably low at 59 (near recent days but 80 yesterday).  There are
   multiple possible etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the
   setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on AEDs,
   Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI).  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity, now with potential
   contribution by phenytoin. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin today
 reevaluate in a.m. depending on next
   platelet count.
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   Anemia, chronic disease
   Per wife, receives chronic blood transfusions as outpatient.  1 unit
   PRBCs ordered for this AM given crit 22.7, and wound site c/d/i, no
   evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  On procrit as outpatient.
   No evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.  Not evidently septic
   physiology at present, but may consider transfusion if lowering given
   near 21.
   - Maintain active type and screen (last sent [**11-17**])
   CAD
   - continue aspirin, plavix.
   Systolic CHF
   Significantly volume up this stay.
   - Continue daily weights.
   - HD for fluid management per renal
   Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies
   On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with pt's
   neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
s seizures are part of
   this disease process.  S/p IVIGx 5 days.
   - continue steroids (reducing from stress dose after dialysis
   initiation) and cell-cept
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2
 sugars stable.  Cover with SSI (increased scale yesterday) and
   long acting insulin. Adjust as needed.
   - Follow when weaning stress-dose steroids.
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve both
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation).
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Heparin SQ [**Hospital1 7**].

   (contributors include his myopathy, medications, though unclear if he
   received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  Difficult to wean
   previously and now intubated for more than two weeks, necessitating
   discussion of goals of care.  Likely contribution from encephalopathy.
   - Continue current vent settings
   - Check NIF as weakness likely contributing to his failure to wean
   - Avoid additional sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept and prednisone (stress dose) for treatment of
   necrotizing myopathy
   - Would like to wean stress-dose steroids, but will hold for now given
   hypotension
   - Need to re-address goals of care with family (and likely need for
   trach/peg), given pt
s prolonged intubation and extubation failure x 2.
   - Continue current vent settings for now
   Mental Status / Status Epilepticus
   EEG and clinical consistent with diffuse encephalopathy.  Etiology
   unclear, but status and mental status followed hypotensive episodes
   most likely hypoxic/anoxic brain injury despite negative MRI
   previously.
   - Follow Neuro recs for anticonvulsant dosing (no changes for now)
   - Per neuro weekend coverage, no indication for repeat MRI for
   prognostic purposes presently; can re-address with regular neuro team
   on Monday.
   - Follow Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels daily for now and in context of
   initiating HD
   - Phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Dilantin 300 mg TIDl, goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypotension
   Now on Midodrine and Neo. Likely due to fluid shifts in the setting of
   HD initiation. No increase in WBC or fever to suggest septic etiology.
   No change in respiratory status
no increased O2 requirement, or change
   in secretions
to suggest VAP.  Also no obvious bleeding or decrease in
   HCT to suggest acute blood loss.
   - Continue to try to wean Neo today. Goal to keep above 90 mmHg
   systolic (MAP will be in 50s).
   - Continue midodrine.
   - Continue stress dose today (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was chronically
   on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy and will
   need a very slow taper when hypotension resolved.
   - Will wean AEDs as recommended by Neuro.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine
   - Holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NGTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   Acute renal failure
   Patient has elevated Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect ATN, given pt
   recent hypotensive episodes and muddy brown casts in urine.  Patient
   continues to be essentially anuric at 75 mL in 24 hours.
   Creatinine/electrolytes WNL, no change in volume/respiratory status, so
   no indications for emergent HD currently.  Patient received 2hrs of HD
   yesterday ([**11-18**]). Current issue is mainly patient
s lack of access for
   HD given that his temporary HD line has now clotted off.
   - Need to address need for new HD access with family.  If pt is to
   continue on long-term dialysis, will need more permanent access.
   Discuss with family repeat temporary line versus tunneled line.
   - Follow up renal recs. HD per renal and access.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - Daily lytes.
   PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant

   - Continue Cefepime/Vanc (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Try to wean off Neo as tolerated.
   Leukocytosis
   Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On Vanc/Cefepime/PO vanc.

   completed
   Thrombocytopenia
   Stably low at 59 (near recent days but 80 yesterday).  There are
   multiple possible etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the
   setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on AEDs,
   Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI).  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity, now with potential
   contribution by phenytoin. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin today

   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.  Continues to be difficult to manage
   given volume overloaded state, hypotension and seizure activity.
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD,
   OSA).  ABG during initial event consistent with hypoventilation
   (contributors include his myopathy, medications, though unclear if he
   received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  Difficult to wean

   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on [**10-31**] due to
   recurrent respiratory failure.  Continues to be difficult to manage
   given volume overloaded state, hypotension and seizure activity.
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD,
   OSA).  ABG during initial event consistent with hypoventilation
   (contributors include his myopathy, medications, though unclear if he
   received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  Difficult to wean
   previously and now intubated for more than two weeks, necessitating
   discussion of goals of care.  Likely contribution from encephalopathy.
   - Avoid additional sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept and prednisone (stress dose) for treatment of
   necrotizing myopathy
   - Would like to wean stress-dose steroids, but will hold for now given
   hypotension
   - Need to re-address goals of care with family (and likely need for
   trach/peg), given pt
s prolonged intubation and extubation failure x 2.
   - Continue current vent settings for now
   Mental Status / Status Epilepticus
   EEG and clinical consistent with diffuse encephalopathy.  Etiology
   unclear, but status and mental status followed hypotensive episodes
   most likely hypoxic brain injury despite negative MRI previously.
   - Follow Neuro recs for anticonvulsant dosing (no changes for now)
   - Per neuro weekend coverage, no indication for repeat MRI for
   prognostic purposes presently; can re-address with regular neuro team
   on Monday.
   - Follow Dilantin, Phenobarbital levels daily for now and in context of
   initiating HD
   - Phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Dilantin 300 mg TIDl, goal of 15-20
   - Continue  maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypotension
   Now on Midodrine and Neo. Likely due to fluid shifts in the setting of
   HD initiation yesterday. No increase in WBC or fever to suggest septic
   etiology.  No change in respiratory status
no increased O2 requirement,
   or change in secretions
to suggest VAP.  Also no obvious bleeding or
   decrease in HCT to suggest acute blood loss.
   - Continue to try to wean Neo today. Goal to keep above 90 mmHg
   systolic (MAP will be in 50s).
   - Continue midodrine.
   - Continue stress dose today (hydrocort 50mg Q8hr); pt was chronically
   on prednisone 5mg PO daily at home for necrotizing myopathy and will
   need a very slow taper when hypotension resolved.
   - Will wean AEDs as recommended by Neuro.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - Continue levothyroxine
   - Holding Lopressor
   - Following blood, urine cultures, wound culture, NGTD
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime; as treatment for pt
s wound infection and to
   cover any septic physiology.
   Acute renal failure
   Pt has elevated Cr and decreasing UOP.  Suspect ATN, given pt
s recent
   hypotensive episodes and muddy brown casts in urine
 patient continues
   to be essentially anuric at 60 mL in 24 hours.  Creatinine/electrolytes
   WNL, no change in volume/respiratory status, so no indications for
   emergent HD currently.  Patient received 2hrs of HD yesterday ([**11-18**]).
   Current issue is mainly pt
s lack of access for HD given that his
   temporary HD line has now clotted off.
   - Need to address need for new HD access with family.  If pt is to
   continue on long-term dialysis, will need more permanent access.
   - Follow up renal recs. HD per renal and access.
   - Treating UTI with Cefepime; monitoring recent Ucxs.
   - Daily lytes.
   PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime. L LE with increasing pallor and
   coolness, duskiness.
   - Continue Cefepime/Vanc (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Try to wean off Neo as tolerated.
   Leukocytosis
   Leukocytosis improved since yesterday. On Vanc/Cefepime/PO vanc.
   Improving with C. Diff treatment.
   - F/u [**11-16**] urine cx, cefepime should cover gram negatives(three week
   course to end on [**2196-11-21**])
   - F/u wound care recs regarding decub ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff for two weeks after IV course
   completed
   Thrombocytopenia
   Stably low at 59 (near recent days but 80 yesterday).  There are
   multiple possible etiologies, including bone marrow suppression in the
   setting of acute inflammation, drug adverse effect (pt is on AEDs,
   Vanc, Cefepime and a PPI).  HIT antibodies were negative. Suspect
   inflammation or drug induced BM toxicity, now with potential
   contribution by phenytoin. Continue to monitor.
   - Continue heparin today
 reevaluate in a.m. depending on next
   platelet count.
   - Transfusion goal >10 or greater if bleeds.
   Anemia, chronic disease
   Per wife, receives chronic blood transfusions as outpatient.  1 unit
   PRBCs ordered for this AM given crit 22.7, and wound site c/d/i, no
   evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.  On procrit as outpatient.
   No evidence of hemolysis based on TBIL.  Not evidently septic
   physiology at present, but may consider transfusion if lowering given
   near 21.
   - Maintain active type and screen (last sent [**11-17**])
   CAD
   - continue aspirin, plavix.
   Systolic CHF
   Significantly volume up this stay.
   - Continue daily weights.
   - HD for fluid management per renal
   Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies
   On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with pt's
   neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that pt
s seizures are part of
   this disease process.  S/p IVIGx 5 days.
   - continue steroids (reducing from stress dose after dialysis
   initiation) and cell-cept
   # GERD
 on PPI
   # Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid.
   # DM2
 sugars stable.  Cover with SSI (increased scale yesterday) and
   long acting insulin. Adjust as needed.
   - Follow when weaning stress-dose steroids.
   # FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h. Will aggressively replete
   electrolytes to improve pt
s muscle tone (which should improve both
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation).

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, who experienced hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was initially extubated but had to be reintubated due to recurrent respiratory failure. He has been intubated for more than two weeks and is currently experiencing hypotension, encephalopathy, acute renal failure, peripheral vascular disease with wound infection, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, chronic disease, coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, necrotizing myopathy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 2, and is on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and cardiovascular drugs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for over two weeks, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate cultures are necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased venous return due to the amputation increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be continued.
3. Sepsis: The patient has an active wound infection with Pseudomonas and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of developing se"

   (Was C. diff in stool on [**11-16**])
   (Pseudomonas in wound; Klebsiella in urine in mid [**Month (only) 3**])
   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCV x1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Patient was
   extubated during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on
   [**10-31**] due to recurrent respiratory failure.  He continues to be
   difficult to manage given volume overloaded state, hypotension and
   seizure activity.
   Intermittent Desaturation
   Two events last night. First while suppine at end of dialysis; second
   later in the night with repositioning. Respiratory therapist says been
   evident before, but typically with more rapid recovery. In context of
   some cough and increase thick secretions, movement, so suspect mucus
   plugging and secretions as cause. On DVT prophylaxis, so PE unlikely
   and recovered between. ACS possible given fluid shift during dialysis -
   low suspicion, but will follow. CXR unremarkable for developed PNA,
   pneumothorax etc.
   - Sputum culture
   - Repeat CXR tomorrow
   - EKG and one set enzymes
   - Aggressive lavage/pulm. toilet
   Hemodialysis
   Important to remove gadolinium, coodinate with vanc trough, consider
   replacing HD catheter (working with tPA at present) depending on goals
   of care.  Three session for dialysis of gad.  Hypokalemic this a.m. so
   Renal will use higher K dialysis fluid (4.0) today.
   - Will be this a.m. at around 8 a.m.
   - Follow line patency - consider replacement depending on goals of care
   Mental status/status epilepticus
   Unclear if in status at present, but period of increased risk given HD.
   Question of hypoxic/anoxic brain injury despite negative earlier MRI.
   EEG and clinical findings consistent with diffuse
   encephalopathy.Neurologically, brainstem function intact, still without
   evidence of cortical function.  Has been desynchronization at least
   partially intact c/w intact forebrain arousal mechanism
   (lat. Hypothal -> cortex), but still unclear why dramatically impaired
   LOC.
   - Await formal read of MRI
   - Have EEG leads replaced this a.m. (possibly depending on goals of
   care and MRI)
   - Check phenobarb and dilantin levels (daily)
   - Continue phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Continue dilantin 300 mg tid, goal of 15-20
   - Continue maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to follow neuro recs for possible later wean AEDs
   - Discuss with family regarding goals of care regarding hypoxic/anoxic
   brain injury
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Worsened intermittently as described above.  Patient with chronic
   metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during
   initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his
   myopathy, medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram
   prior to intubation).  Difficult to wean previously and now intubated
   for more than two weeks, necessitating discussion of goals of care for
   trach - given likely worsening chances of wean now.  Likely
   contribution from encephalopathy.
   - Continue AC for now
   - Discuss with family regarding goals of care and trach/peg given
   patients prolonged hospital course, extubation failure x 2 depending on
   above
   - Continue cellcept and prednisone (reduced from stress dose from 50 to
   25 Q8H) for treatment of necrotizing myopathy
   - Continue vancomycin IV/cefepime IV/vancomycin PO
   Hypotension
   Stable with SBP typically > 100 mmHg on minimal pressors (medodrine +
   0.2 neo). Likely [**12-19**] fluid shifts in the setting of HD. Less likely
   sepsis as no leukocytosis/fever. Less likely blood loss as Hct stable.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be developing VAP.
   - Continue to wean neo as tolerated (goal sBP > 90mmHg, MAP in 50s)
   - Continue midodrine
   - Decrease stress-dose hydrocortisone to 25mg IV q8 (from 50mg IV q8)
   - Continue to hold lopressor
   Renal failure
   Stable anuria at ~ 75mL per 24 hours.  Likely ATN given patient
   recent hypotensive episodes and muddy brown casts in urine, but now
   without recovery.  Now on HD due to gadolinium. Line may need
   replacement but patent with tPA at present.
   - Discuss with family regarding goals of care and temporary HD versus
   tunneled line
   - HD today and tomorrow (and was last night)
   - Increased K in solution per Renal
   - Continue to follow renal recs
   - Add on vancomycin trough in case decide to continue
   - Continue daily electrolytes
   PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to meropenem, sensitive to cefepime. L LE with pallor and coolness,
   duskiness which is stable.
   - Last day vancomycin/cefepime (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Continue to wean neo as tolerated
   C. diff + stool and leucocytosis
   Resolving WBC and diarrhea. On vancomycin (IV/PO)/cefepime, but will
   stop IVs today. Improving with c. diff treatment (PO vanc)
   - Continue vancomycin/cefepime (last day [**11-21**] concludes three week
   course)
   - Continue to follow up wound care recommendations regarding decubitus
   ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff for two weeks after IV course
   completed
   Anemia, chronic disease
   Stable, down trending and resolve with blood transfusion. Per wife,
   receives chronic blood transfusions as outpatient. No evidence of
   bleed, hemolysis.
   - s/p 1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given Hct 22.4
   - Follow up PM Hct
   - Continue to transfuse prn goal Hct > 21
   - Likely initiate epo during HD (? may depend on goals of care - d/w
   Renal after clearer on this)
   - Obtain  stool guaiac x3
   - Continue to maintain active type and screen (last sent [**11-20**])
   Thrombocytopenia
   Stable, low at 89 but stable. Etiologies include bone marrow
   suppression, acute inflammation, drug adverse effect; HIT antibodies
   negative.
   - Continue heparin prophylaxis
   - Continue to transfuse prn goal Hct > 21
   CAD
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - BB/ACEI if indicated in future, but certainly not soon.
   Systolic CHF
   - Continue daily weights
   - Continue HD fluid management per renal
   Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies
   On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with
   patient
s neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that patient
   seizures are part of this disease process.  S/p IVIG x 5 days.
   - Continue steroids and cellcept as per above
   GERDL: Continue PPI
   Hypothyroidism: Continue synthroid
   DM2: Continue SSI; follow when weaning stress-dose steroids
   FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h; aggressively replete
   electrolytes (will improve patient

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for below-knee amputation. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was managed with direct current cardioversion. He also had hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to intubation. The patient's current condition includes reduced level of consciousness, status epilepticus, and respiratory failure. He is experiencing intermittent desaturation events, likely due to mucus plugging and secretions. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's mental status and status epilepticus require further evaluation with an EEG and MRI. He is on hemodialysis due to renal failure, with plans for temporary HD versus tunneled line. The patient's peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is complicated by a recent right below-knee amputation wound infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other comorbidities include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2, necrotizing myopathy, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's intermittent desaturation events and history of prolonged intubation increase the risk of developing VAP. This can be confirmed through sputum culture"

   - Neuro are following: To help prognosticate suggested MRI w&w/o
   - Given Renal failure, Renal very helpful to arrange dialysis
   immediately after to dialyse gadolinium.
   - EEG removed prior to MRI and replaced later
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 775**] met with family to discuss MRI prognostication - if poor
   neurologic prognosis will re-address goals of care - they are coming
   around.
   - HD line is patent (after tPA) and did not need rewiring or
   replacement.
   - MRI by our read looks unremarkable but waiting for real read.
   - Desaturating events last night, x 2 down to high 80s % - took longer
   to recover than usual. Increased sectretions and some cough yesterday.
   Was on PSV and changed back to AC given variable tidal volumes - AC of
   benefit. VBG similar to previous and no change on CXR yet.

   Microbiology: Yeast in urine.
   (Was C. diff in stool on [**11-16**])
   (Pseudomonas in wound; Klebsiella in urine in mid [**Month (only) 3**])
   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCV x1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Patient was
   extubated during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on
   [**10-31**] due to recurrent respiratory failure.  He continues to be
   difficult to manage given volume overloaded state, hypotension and
   seizure activity.
   Intermittent Desaturation
   Two events last night. First while suppine at end of dialysis; second
   later in the night with repositioning. Respiratory therapist says been
   evident before, but typically with more rapid recovery. In context of
   some cough and increase thick secretions, movement, so suspect mucus
   plugging and secretions as cause. On DVT prophylaxis, so PE unlikely
   and recovered between. ACS possible given fluid shift during dialysis -
   low suspicion, but will follow. CXR unremarkable for developed PNA,
   pneumothorax etc.
   - Sputum culture
   - Repeat CXR tomorrow
   - EKG and one set enzymes
   - Aggressive lavage/pulm. toilet
   Hemodialysis
   Important to remove gadolinium, coodinate with vanc trough, consider
   replacing HD catheter (working with tPA at present) depending on goals
   of care.  Three session for dialysis of gad.  Hypokalemic this a.m. so
   Renal will use higher K dialysis fluid (4.0) today.
   - Will be this a.m. at around 8 a.m.
   - Follow line patency - consider replacement depending on goals of care
   Mental status/status epilepticus
   Unclear if in status at present, but period of increased risk given HD.
   Question of hypoxic/anoxic brain injury despite negative earlier MRI.
   EEG and clinical findings consistent with diffuse
   encephalopathy.Neurologically, brainstem function intact, still without
   evidence of cortical function.
   - Await formal read of MRI
   - Have EEG leads replaced this a.m. (possibly depending on goals of
   care and MRI)
   - Check phenobarb and dilantin levels (daily)
   - Continue phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Continue dilantin 300 mg tid, goal of 15-20
   - Continue maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to follow neuro recs for possible later wean AEDs
   - Discuss with family regarding goals of care regarding hypoxic/anoxic
   brain injury
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Worsened intermittently as described above.  Patient with chronic
   metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA).  ABG during
   initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors include his
   myopathy, medications, though unclear if he received dilaudid or ultram
   prior to intubation).  Difficult to wean previously and now intubated
   for more than two weeks, necessitating discussion of goals of care for
   trach - given likely worsening chances of wean now.  Likely
   contribution from encephalopathy.
   - Continue AC for now
   - Discuss with family regarding goals of care and trach/peg given
   patients prolonged hospital course, extubation failure x 2 depending on
   above
   - Continue cellcept and prednisone (reduced from stress dose from 50 to
   25 Q8H) for treatment of necrotizing myopathy
   - Continue vancomycin IV/cefepime IV/vancomycin PO
   Hypotension
   Stable with SBP typically > 100 mmHg on minimal pressors (medodrine +
   0.2 neo). Likely [**12-19**] fluid shifts in the setting of HD. Less likely
   sepsis as no leukocytosis/fever. Less likely blood loss as Hct stable.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be developing VAP.
   - Continue to wean neo as tolerated (goal sBP > 90mmHg, MAP in 50s)
   - Continue midodrine
   - Decrease stress-dose hydrocortisone to 25mg IV q8 (from 50mg IV q8)
   - Continue to hold lopressor
   Renal failure
   Stable anuria at ~ 75mL per 24 hours.  Likely ATN given patient
   recent hypotensive episodes and muddy brown casts in urine, but now
   without recovery.  Now on HD due to gadolinium. Line may need
   replacement but patent with tPA at present.
   - Discuss with family regarding goals of care and temporary HD versus
   tunneled line
   - HD today and tomorrow (and was last night)
   - Increased K in solution per Renal
   - Continue to follow renal recs
   - Add on vancomycin trough in case decide to continue
   - Continue daily electrolytes
   PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to meropenem, sensitive to cefepime. L LE with pallor and coolness,
   duskiness which is stable.
   - Last day vancomycin/cefepime (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Continue to wean neo as tolerated
   C. diff + stool and leucocytosis
   Resolving WBC and diarrhea. On vancomycin (IV/PO)/cefepime, but will
   stop IVs today. Improving with c. diff treatment (PO vanc)
   - Continue vancomycin/cefepime (last day [**11-21**] concludes three week
   course)
   - Continue to follow up wound care recommendations regarding decubitus
   ulcer
   - Continue oral vancomycin for c. diff for two weeks after IV course
   completed
   Anemia, chronic disease
   Stable, down trending and resolve with blood transfusion. Per wife,
   receives chronic blood transfusions as outpatient. No evidence of
   bleed, hemolysis.
   - s/p 1 unit PRBCs ordered for this AM given Hct 22.4
   - Follow up PM Hct
   - Continue to transfuse prn goal Hct > 21
   - Likely initiate epo during HD (? may depend on goals of care - d/w
   Renal after clearer on this)
   - Obtain  stool guaiac x3
   - Continue to maintain active type and screen (last sent [**11-20**])
   Thrombocytopenia
   Stable, low at 89 but stable. Etiologies include bone marrow
   suppression, acute inflammation, drug adverse effect; HIT antibodies
   negative.
   - Continue heparin prophylaxis
   - Continue to transfuse prn goal Hct > 21
   CAD
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   Systolic CHF
   - Continue daily weights
   - Continue HD fluid management per renal

   On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with
   patient
s neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that patient
   seizures are part of this disease process.  S/p IVIG x 5 days.
   - Continue steroids and cellcept as per above
   GERDL: Continue PPI
   Hypothyroidism: Continue synthroid
   DM2: Continue SSI; follow when weaning stress-dose steroids
   FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h; aggressively replete

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted for below-knee amputation. The patient has a complex medical history, including renal failure, necrotizing myopathy, hypoxic/anoxic brain injury, respiratory failure, and sepsis. 

The patient's current condition is stable but remains critically ill. He is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to recurrent respiratory failure. The patient's mental status is also concerning, with ongoing seizures and encephalopathy. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and an elevated heart rate. His respiratory rate is within normal limits, but he is desaturating intermittently, which may be due to mucus plugging and secretions. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia, chronic disease, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has multiple infections, including yeast in the urine and pseudomonas in the wound. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antiepileptics, and dialysis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, worsening of renal function, sepsis, and complications related to the patient's underlying conditions, such as necrotizing myopathy and hypoxic/anoxic brain injury. 

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his critical care needs, including respiratory support, hemodialysis, seizure control, and"

   immediately after to dialyse gadolinium.
   - EEG removed prior to MRI and replaced later
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 775**] met with family to discuss MRI prognostication - if poor
   neurologic prognosis will re-address goals of care - they are coming
   around.
   - HD line is patent (after tPA) and did not need rewiring or
   replacement.
   - MRI by our read looks unremarkable but waiting for real read.
   - Desaturating events last night, x 2 down to high 80s % - took longer
   to recover than usual. Increased sectretions and some cough yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted for below-knee amputation. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation and transient pressor support. The patient was extubated during hospitalization but needed to be reintubated due to recurrent respiratory failure. He continues to be difficult to manage with volume overload, hypotension, and seizure activity. The patient has several medical complications including reduced level of consciousness, status epilepticus, respiratory failure, anemia, chronic disease, thrombocytopenia, necrotizing myopathy, C. diff infection, and necrotizing fasciitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reduced level of consciousness: The patient is experiencing a decreased mental status, which may be due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or brain injury. This condition requires close monitoring and neurologic input for prognostication.
2. Status epilepticus: The patient is having recurrent seizure activity, indicating ongoing status epilepticus. It is essential to continue phenobarbital and dilantin as per neurologic recommendations and discuss possible weaning of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) later.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic metabolic alkalosis and hypoventilation, making it difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation. Goals of care regarding tracheostomy and prolonged ventilation need to"

   epilepticus, respiratory failure, renal failure and unresponsiveness.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Epilepsy recommends dilantin and free dilantin level; keep
   phenobarbital level at 20; keep AEDs at current levels to prevent
   status epilepticus; prognosis difficult to predict as no evidence of
   anoxic brain injury on MRI and symptoms can be related to post status
   epilepticus and recommend up to three weeks of current supportive
   management
   - Neurology recommends to restart continuous EEG to further evaluate
   for NCSE

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCV x1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Patient was
   extubated during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on
   [**10-31**] due to recurrent respiratory failure.  He continues to be
   difficult to manage given volume overloaded state, hypotension and
   seizure activity.
   Intermittent Desaturation
   Two events last night. First while suppine at end of dialysis; second
   later in the night with repositioning. Respiratory therapist says been
   evident before, but typically with more rapid recovery. In context of
   some cough and increase thick secretions, movement, so suspect mucus
   plugging and secretions as cause. On DVT prophylaxis, so PE unlikely
   and recovered between. Unlikely ACS. CXR unremarkable for developed
   PNA, pneumothorax etc., but does show widened mediastinum of unclear
   significance

   Neurology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], read as hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy. Unclear
   if in status at present, but period of increased risk given HD.
   Question of hypoxic/anoxic brain injury despite negative earlier MRI.
   EEG and clinical findings consistent with diffuse
   encephalopathy.Neurologically, brainstem function intact, still without
   evidence of cortical function.  Has been desynchronization at least
   partially intact c/w intact forebrain arousal mechanism
   (lat. Hypothal -> cortex), but still unclear why dramatically impaired
   LOC (perhaps other component of arousal system, but also possible
   content component (thalamus -> cortex) given little sustained
   desynchrony.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for various health issues including respiratory failure, renal failure, hypotension, and a history of amputation. The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, hydrocodone, sulfa, Haldol, Vicodin, morphine, atorvastatin, metoclopramide, and propofol. 

The patient's medical history includes bilateral lower extremity below-knee amputations, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and necrotizing myopathy. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to recurrent respiratory failure and has undergone hemodialysis. 

Current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/45 to 124/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased creatinine level, and altered electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal no acute intracranial abnormality, but there are pooled secretions within the superior nasopharynx and under-pneumatized bilateral mastoid air cells. Microbiology tests show no growth on blood cultures, but previous tests indicated yeast, Klebsiella in urine,"

   either. Again noted are pooled secretions within the superior
   nasopharynx.
   The bilateral mastoid air cells are under-pneumatized. The venous and
   arterial intracranial vasculature is patent without evidence of
   stenosis or
   aneurysm formation.
   Microbiology: No growth on blood cultures ([**11-16**], [**11-19**], [**11-21**]). Previously
   yeast, kebsiella in urine and C. diff. in stool.
   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo M admitted [**10-18**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCV x1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**10-27**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Patient was
   extubated during hospitalization, but then had to be re-intubated on
   [**10-31**] due to recurrent respiratory failure.  He continues to be
   difficult to manage given volume overloaded state, hypotension and
   controlled seizure activity (status) and markedly reduced level of
   consciousness.  MRI unexpected normal
 therefore goals of care need to
   be discussed with Neurology and family given very grave prognosis.  We
   feel that he is physiologically delicate and that it is unlikely that
   he might be managed outside of the ICU due to heart failure, ESRD,
   dialysis, low pressures and respiratory failure.
   Mental status/status epilepticus
   Neurology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], read as hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy. Unclear
   if in status at present, but period of increased risk given HD and
   lower phenobarb (phenytoin therapeutic based on low albumin). Also
   possible, given normal MRI, that reduce LOC is secondary to AEDs and
   previous status.  This question will need to be resolved with neurology
   because it will impact prognostication and goals of care.
   Neurologically, brainstem function intact, still without evidence of
   cortical function.
   - Appreciate Neurology input and prognostication and their discussion
   with us about how best to proceed given MOD and physiologic fagility.
   - Await formal read of EEG
   - Check phenobarb and dilantin levels (daily)
   - Continue phenobarbital 100 mg QID goal level 30
   - Continue dilantin 300 mg tid, goal of 15-20
   - Continue maintenance dose of Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]
   Hemodialysis and Renal Failure
   Gadolinium dialysis complete with two sessions.  Therefore wait for one
   day before HD again.  This may afford opportunity to reduce pressor
   requirement again. Antibiotics stopped so vancomycin will not now need
   to be coordinated with HD. Depending on goals of care and discussion as
   described above, will need to consider new HD line (along with
   tracheostomy and G-tube). Stable anuria at ~ 75mL per 24 hours.  Likely
   ATN given patient
s recent hypotensive episodes and muddy brown casts
   in urine, but now without recovery.  Now on HD due to gadolinium. Line
   may need replacement but patent with tPA at present.
   - Discuss with family/Neurology (as above) regarding goals of care
   (because will need new HD line)
   - Continue to follow renal recs
   - Continue daily electrolytes
   - Discuss HD with renal after resolving goals of care
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD,
   OSA).  ABG during initial event consistent with hypoventilation
   (contributors include his myopathy, medications, though unclear if he
   received dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  Difficult to wean
   previously and now intubated for more than two weeks, necessitating
   discussion of goals of care for trach - given likely worsening chances
   of wean now.  Likely contribution from encephalopathy.
   - Continue AC for now (given difficulty in maintaining sats last night
   on PSV)
   - Discuss with family regarding goals of care and trach/peg given
   patients prolonged hospital course, extubation failure x 2 depending on
   above
   - Continue cellcept and prednisone (reduced from stress dose from 50 to
   25 Q8H) for treatment of necrotizing myopathy
   - Stop vancomycin and cefepime IV given no recent change while treated
   C. difficile colitis
   - Two weeks of oral vancomycin starting today (ending [**12-6**])
   Hypotension
   Stable with SBP typically > 100 mmHg on minimal pressors (medodrine +
   0.2
 0.8 neo). Likely [**12-19**] fluid shifts in the setting of HD. Unlikely
   sepsis as no leukocytosis/fever. Less likely blood loss as Hct stable.
   - Continue to wean neo as tolerated (goal sBP > 90mmHg, MAP in 50s)
   - Continue midodrine
   - Continue hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q8
   - Continue to hold lopressor
   PVD s/p recent R BKA with wound infection, and distant history L BKA
   Most recent wound cxr from R BKA growing pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant
   to meropenem, sensitive to cefepime. L LE with pallor and coolness,
   duskiness which is stable.
   - Last day vancomycin/cefepime (last day [**11-21**])
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Continue to wean neo as tolerated
   Decubitus Ulcer
   - Continue to follow up wound care recommendations regarding decubitus
   ulcer
   Anemia, chronic disease
   Stable, down trending and resolve with blood transfusion. Per wife,
   receives chronic blood transfusions as outpatient. No evidence of
   bleed, hemolysis.
   - 1 unit PRBCs this AM to support dialysis given 23s.
   - Follow up PM Hct
   - Otherwise continue to transfuse prn goal Hct > 21
   - Obtain  stool guaiac x3
   - Continue to maintain active type and screen (last sent [**11-20**])
   Thrombocytopenia
   Improving. Etiologies include bone marrow suppression, acute
   inflammation, drug adverse effect; HIT antibodies negative.
   - Continue heparin prophylaxis now higher
   CAD
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - BB/ACEI if indicated in future, but certainly not soon.
   Systolic CHF
   - Continue daily weights
   - Continue HD fluid management per renal
   Necrotizing myopathy with history of myasthenia antibodies
   On cellcept/prednisone as an outpatient.  Cellcept was previously held,
   but resumed during last admission to [**Hospital1 19**] after discussion with
   patient
s neurologist.  Neurologist does not think that patient
   seizures are part of this disease process.  S/p IVIG x 5 days.
   - Continue steroids and cellcept as per above
   GERD: Continue PPI
   Hypothyroidism: Continue synthroid
   DM2: Continue SSI; follow when weaning stress-dose steroids
   FEN: Tube feeds; free water flush 50mL q6h; aggressively replete
   electrolytes (will improve patient
s muscle tone which should improve
   respiratory status and peripheral circulation)
   Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin SQ [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted for right lower extremity below-knee amputation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and subsequent cardioversion. He had episodes of hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing volume overload, hypotension, controlled seizure activity, and significantly reduced level of consciousness. Despite a normal MRI, the patient's mental status is concerning, and it is unclear if he is in status epilepticus at present. The neurologist suspects hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and prognosis. The patient also has renal failure, anuria, and is on hemodialysis. He has chronic metabolic alkalosis and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to his myopathy and medications. The patient has a history of necrotizing myopathy and is on cellcept and prednisone. He has a prosthetic vascular device (PVD) due to recent right below-knee amputation and has a distant history of left below-knee amputation. The patient's wound infection from the right below-knee amputation is resistant to meropenem but sensitive to cefepime. His left lower extremity shows pallor and coolness. The patient has anemia, chronic disease, and thrombocytopen"
