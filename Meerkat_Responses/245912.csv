   Assessment and Plan
   74yo M with with multiple admissions for difficult to control AF with
   RVR admitted from EP lab with pericardial effusion after PVI.
   .
   #  Pulsless Sustained V Tach:  Code Blue overnight at 1am,
   cardioverted, pt regained spontaneous circulation.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Monitor on telemetry closely
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion:  With tamponade physiology, hypotension during
   a fib ablation.  Likely from complication of procedure.  Pericardial
   drain placed yesterday.  F/U Echo showed only trivial effusion
   following.
   - continue to hold coumadin for now
   - O2 sat off drain was 96%, likely origin is LA
   - attempt to wean norepinephrine as able
   - Monitor drain output, only 100cc post code
   - TTE today to monitor development, if stable, will pull drain
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely secondary to tamponade.  However other
   etiologies considered were CHD with poor CO, AF with poor CO,
   hypovolemia from bleeding post-procedure.  BPs have been labile on
   propofol, unable to wean norepinephrine
   - continue norepinephrine, will attempt to wean as able
   - monitor drain output
   - Will check hct and give blood as needed
   - Will have FFP if effusion progresses to reverse coumadin/bleeding
   tendency
   - Will monitor for volume overload and poor CO and give lasix as
   needed.
   .
   #. AF with RVR: Patient with long history of difficult to control AF
   and PVI was unable to be performed today given above.
   - continue digoxin for rate control
   - continue amiodarone drip, decrease to 0.5mg/[**Last Name (LF) 83**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] change to PO
   eventually
   - monitor HRs on norepinephrine, attempt to wean as able
   - Will likely need a pacemaker eventually with AV node ablation
   - Continue ceflex
   .
   #. Respiratory acidosis, acute on chronic:  Has poor lung function at
   baseline with severe COPD. Intubated for procedure but may be difficult
   extubation currently as must lie flat post-procedure.
   - Will have upright prior to attempting extubation
   - Will wean sedation prior to extubation
   - Will f/u CXR and treat for pulm edema if necessary prior to
   extubation.
   - Will try to extubate today
   .
   #. COPD: Will continue home inhalers once extubated.
   .
   #. DM2: Will have ISS while hospitalized.
   .
   #. HTN: Currently hypotensive so will hold home BP meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation and right ventricular overload admitted from the electrophysiology lab with pericardial effusion after a procedure called percutaneous vascular interruption (PVI). The patient experienced pulsless sustained ventricular tachycardia, underwent cardioversion, and regained spontaneous circulation. A pericardial drain was placed due to tamponade physiology, and a follow-up echocardiogram showed only trivial effusion.

The patient's condition has been unstable with labile blood pressures, and other etiologies for hypotension such as cardiogenic shock, poor cardiac output, and hypovolemia have been considered. The patient is currently on norepinephrine and being closely monitored.

The patient has a long-standing history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and is currently on digoxin for rate control and amiodarone for rhythm control. The plan is to wean off amiodarone to oral administration once stable.

The patient also has severe COPD and was intubated for the procedure. There are concerns about difficult extubation, especially since the patient must lie flat post-procedure. The plan is to have the patient upright before attempting extubation and to wean sedation prior to extubation.

Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and"

   - Will give FFP if effusion has progressed to reverse coumadin
   - contine to hold coumadin for now
   - O2 sat off drain was 96%, likely origin is LA
   - attempt to wean norepinephrine as able
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely secondary to tamponade.  However other
   etiologies considered were CHD with poor CO, AF with poor CO,
   hypovolemia from bleeding post-procedure.  BPs have been labile on
   propofol, unable to wean norepinephrine
   - continue norepinephrine, will attempt to wean as able
   - monitor drain output
   - Will check hct and give blood as needed
   - Will have FFP if effusion progresses to reverse coumadin/bleeding
   tendency
   - Will monitor for volume overload and poor CO and give lasix as
   needed.
   .
   #. AF with RVR: Patient with long history of difficult to control AF
   and PVI was unable to be performed today given above.
   - continue dofetilide
   - continue digoxin
   - continue amiodarone drip
   - monitor HRs on norepinephrine, attempt to wean as able
   .
   #. Respiratory acidosis, acute on chronic:  Has poor lung function at
   baseline with severe COPD. Intubated for procedure but may be difficult
   extubation currently as must lie flat post-procedure.
   - Will have upright prior to attempting extubation
   - Will wean sedation prior to extubation
   - Will f/u CXR and treat for pulm edema if necessary prior to
   extubation.
   - Will try to extubate today
   .
   #. COPD: Will continue home inhalers once extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple admissions for difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR). He was admitted from the electrophysiology (EP) lab with a pericardial effusion after percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI). The patient experienced a code blue overnight due to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), regained spontaneous circulation, and continues on amiodarone. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulsless Sustained VT: The patient experienced a code blue overnight due to sustained VT, which can lead to cardiac arrest and may require immediate defibrillation or cardioversion.
2. Pericardial Effusion: The patient developed a pericardial effusion likely as a complication of the EP procedure. This can lead to cardiac tamponade, causing hypotension and impaired cardiac function.
3. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension secondary to tamponade physiology, but other etiologies such as CHD with poor CO, AF with poor CO, and hypovolemia from bleeding post-procedure should also be considered.
4. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient has poor lung function at baseline with severe COPD and is at risk for respiratory acidosis,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient in the ICU has experienced several significant events. Firstly, the patient underwent two transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) which revealed no pericardial effusion and an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. However, the second TTE showed a decreased EF of 30%. Additionally, the patient had episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) followed by a sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) with hypotension, leading to a code being called. The patient was successfully resuscitated with three shocks, chest compressions, epinephrine, lidocaine, vasopressin, and an amiodarone bolus followed by a drip. The patient's pulse returned, but they required continued amiodarone drip overnight.

The patient's allergies include statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) causing myalgia, prednisone causing confusion/delirium, albuterol causing arrhythmia/palpitations, and a previous antibiotic causing an unknown reaction.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of norepinephrine at 0.2 mcg/kg/min and amiodarone at 1 mg/min. Other ICU medications and routine medications are also being administered.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate ranging from"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple admissions for difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation (AF) and rate ventricular response (RVR). The patient was admitted from the electrophysiology (EP) lab with a pericardial effusion after a procedure known as percutaneous pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).

The patient experienced several significant events during the 24-hour period. Initially, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no pericardial effusion and an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. However, later in the evening, the patient had episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) followed by a sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) with hypotension, leading to a code being called. The patient received three shocks, chest compressions, epinephrine, lidocaine, vasopressin, and amiodarone bolus followed by a drip. The follow-up TTE showed no effusion but a decreased EF from 40% to 30%.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated. The vital signs show a heart rate (HR) ranging from 55 to 151 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 72 to 118 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (Sp"

   Assessment and Plan
   74yo M with with multiple admissions for difficult to control AF with
   RVR admitted from EP lab with pericardial effusion after PVI.
   .
   #  Pulsless Sustained V Tach:  Code Blue overnight at 1am,
   cardioverted, pt regained spontaneous circulation.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Monitor on telemetry closely
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion:  With tamponade physiology, hypotension during
   a fib ablation.  Likely from complication of procedure.  Pericardial
   drain placed yesterday.  F/U Echo showed only trivial effusion
   following.
   - continue to hold coumadin for now
   - O2 sat off drain was 96%, likely origin is LA
   - attempt to wean norepinephrine as able
   - Monitor drain output, only 100cc post code
   - TTE today to monitor development, if stable, will pull drain
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely secondary to tamponade.  However other
   etiologies considered were CHD with poor CO, AF with poor CO,
   hypovolemia from bleeding post-procedure.  BPs have been labile on
   propofol, unable to wean norepinephrine
   - continue norepinephrine, will attempt to wean as able
   - monitor drain output
   - Will check hct and give blood as needed
   - Will have FFP if effusion progresses to reverse coumadin/bleeding
   tendency
   - Will monitor for volume overload and poor CO and give lasix as
   needed.
   .
   #. AF with RVR: Patient with long history of difficult to control AF
   and PVI was unable to be performed today given above.
   - continue digoxin for rate control
   - continue amiodarone drip, decrease to 0.5mg/[**Last Name (LF) 83**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] change to PO
   eventually
   - monitor HRs on norepinephrine, attempt to wean as able
   - Will likely need a pacemaker eventually with AV node ablation
   - Continue ceflex
   .
   #. Respiratory acidosis, acute on chronic:  Has poor lung function at
   baseline with severe COPD. Intubated for procedure but may be difficult
   extubation currently as must lie flat post-procedure.
   - Will have upright prior to attempting extubation
   - Will wean sedation prior to extubation
   - Will f/u CXR and treat for pulm edema if necessary prior to
   extubation.
   - Will try to extubate today
   .
   #. COPD: Will continue home inhalers once extubated.
   .
   #. DM2: Will have ISS while hospitalized.
   .
   #. HTN: Currently hypotensive so will hold home BP meds.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation (AF) and recent pericardial effusion post pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure. The patient was admitted from the electrophysiology lab with pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology, which was likely due to a complication of the procedure. A pericardial drain was placed, and follow-up echocardiogram showed only trivial effusion.

The patient experienced pulsless sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and required a code blue overnight. Cardioversion was performed, and the patient regained spontaneous circulation.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, pericardial effusion, and respiratory acidosis. Hypotension is likely secondary to tamponade, but other etiologies such as congestive heart disease (CHD) with poor cardiac output (CO), AF with poor CO, and hypovolemia from bleeding post-procedure are also being considered.

The patient has a long history of difficult-to-control AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR). A planned pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure was unable to be performed due to the above complications.

The patient's respiratory acidosis is acute on chronic, with poor lung function at baseline due to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Intubation was performed for the procedure but may be difficult to extubate currently, as the patient must lie flat post-procedure.

The patient's other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient's current medications include digoxin for rate control, amiodarone for rhythm control, norepinephrine for hemodynamic support, ceflex for infection prophylaxis, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's lines and sheaths include an arterial line and a central venous catheter. The patient is currently receiving enteral nutrition but has no intravenous fluids. Glycemic control is being monitored.

The patient's code status is full code, and the planned disposition is to the coronary care unit (CCU)."

   Assessment and Plan
   74yo M with with multiple admissions for difficult to control AF with
   RVR admitted from EP lab with pericardial effusion after PVI.
   .
   #  Pulsless Sustained V Tach:  Code Blue overnight at 1am,
   cardioverted, pt regained spontaneous circulation.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Monitor on telemetry closely
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion:  With tamponade physiology, hypotension during
   a fib ablation.  Likely from complication of procedure.  Pericardial
   drain placed yesterday.  F/U Echo showed only trivial effusion
   following.
   - continue to hold coumadin for now
   - O2 sat off drain was 96%, likely origin is LA
   - attempt to wean norepinephrine as able
   - Monitor drain output, only 100cc post code
   - TTE today to monitor development, if stable, will pull drain
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely secondary to tamponade.  However other
   etiologies considered were CHD with poor CO, AF with poor CO,
   hypovolemia from bleeding post-procedure.  BPs have been labile on
   propofol, unable to wean norepinephrine
   - continue norepinephrine, will attempt to wean as able
   - monitor drain output
   - Will check hct and give blood as needed
   - Will have FFP if effusion progresses to reverse coumadin/bleeding
   tendency
   - Will monitor for volume overload and poor CO and give lasix as
   needed.
   .
   #. AF with RVR: Patient with long history of difficult to control AF
   and PVI was unable to be performed today given above.
   - continue digoxin for rate control
   - continue amiodarone drip, decrease to 0.5mg/[**Last Name (LF) 83**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] change to PO
   eventually
   - monitor HRs on norepinephrine, attempt to wean as able
   - Will likely need a pacemaker eventually with AV node ablation
   - Continue ceflex
   .
   #. Respiratory acidosis, acute on chronic:  Has poor lung function at
   baseline with severe COPD. Intubated for procedure but may be difficult
   extubation currently as must lie flat post-procedure.
   - Will have upright prior to attempting extubation
   - Will wean sedation prior to extubation
   - Will f/u CXR and treat for pulm edema if necessary prior to
   extubation.
   - Will try to extubate today
   .
   #. COPD: Will continue home inhalers once extubated.
   .
   #. DM2: Will have ISS while hospitalized.
   .
   #. HTN: Currently hypotensive so will hold home BP meds.
   .
   #. Communication: With son, [**Name (NI) **], cell:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6972**]; home:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6973**]

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation and right ventricular overload admitted from the electrophysiology lab with pericardial effusion after percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI). The patient experienced a code blue overnight due to sustained ventricular tachycardia and was cardioverted, regaining spontaneous circulation.

The patient's current conditions include pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, hypotension during fib ablation likely from the procedure complication, and a pericardial drain placed yesterday. A follow-up echocardiogram showed only trivial effusion following.

Other medical issues include hypotension, likely secondary to tamponade, but other etiologies such as cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CO), atrial fibrillation with poor CO, or hypovolemia from bleeding post-procedure are also considered. BPs have been labile on propofol, and the patient is unable to wean norepinephrine.

The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with severe lung function at baseline, requiring intubation for the procedure. The patient may have difficulty lying flat post-procedure, which may make extubation challenging. Respiratory acidosis, acute on chronic, is present due to poor lung function at baseline.

   Assessment and Plan
   74yo M with with multiple admissions for difficult to control AF with
   RVR admitted from EP lab with pericardial effusion after PVI.
   .
   #  Pulsless Sustained V Tach:  Code Blue yesterday night cardioverted,
   pt regained spontaneous circulation.  No subsequent acute events
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Monitor on telemetry closely
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion:  With tamponade physiology, hypotension during
   a fib ablation.  Likely from complication of procedure.  Pericardial
   drain placed and pulled. O2 sat off drain was 96%, likely origin was
   LA.  F/U Echo showed only trivial effusion following.
   - continue to hold coumadin for now
   - attempt to wean norepinephrine as able
   - consider TTE today to monitor development
   .
   #. Hypotension: Initially likely secondary to tamponade, but now more
   likely secondary to a fib with RVR and decreased EF compared to
   previous echo, unclear etiology may be ischemic, consider cardiac cath
   when stable.  Pt also had a Hct drop yesterday from 41 to 36 with
   guaiac positive stools thus could be hypovolemic.
   - continue norepinephrine, will attempt to wean as able
   - Will check hct and give blood as needed, goal Hct > 30
   - Will monitor for volume overload and poor CO and give lasix as
   needed.
   .
   #. AF with RVR: Patient with long history of difficult to control AF
   and PVI was unable to be performed today given above.
   - continue digoxin for rate control
   - continue amiodarone drip, had to increase to 1mg/[**Last Name (LF) 83**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] change to
   PO eventually
   - monitor HRs on norepinephrine, attempt to wean as able
   - Will likely need a pacemaker eventually with AV node ablation
   - Continue ceflex
   .
   #. Respiratory acidosis, acute on chronic:  Has poor lung function at
   baseline with severe COPD. Intubated for procedure but tolerated
   extubation fine.
   - Monitor closely.
   .
   #  ARF:  FeNa 0.1, did not improve with volume challenge.  Most likely
   renal failure is secondary to ATN from hypotension during code.
   - Continue to monitor renal function
   - Avoid nephrotoxic drugs
   - If does not improve, will consult renal
   .
   #. COPD: Will continue home inhalers once extubated.
   .
   #. DM2: Will have ISS while hospitalized.
   .
   #. HTN: Currently hypotensive so will hold home BP meds.
   .
   #. Communication: With son, [**Name (NI) **], cell:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6972**]; home:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6973**]

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple admissions for difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation and right ventricular overload. He was admitted from the electrophysiology lab with a pericardial effusion after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The patient experienced a pulseless sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and was successfully cardioverted, regaining spontaneous circulation. No subsequent acute events have occurred.

The patient has a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, which occurred during a fib ablation. A pericardial drain was placed and pulled, and an echocardiogram showed only a trivial effusion afterward.

The patient is hypotensive and likely has tamponade secondary to the pericardial effusion, but now it may be secondary to atrial fibrillation with right ventricular overload and decreased ejection fraction compared to previous echocardiogram, unclear etiology possibly ischemic. Consider cardiac catheterization when stable. The patient also had a hematocrit drop from 41 to 36 with guaiac-positive stools, suggesting possible hypovolemia.

The patient has a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation and underwent PVI, which was unable to be performed today. He is on digoxin for rate control and amiodarone drip, which was increased to 1 mg/hr and will eventually be changed to PO. He is also on ceftriaxone."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently intubated and sedated, with a nasogastric tube in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 78 to 126 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 65 to 94 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 19 to 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's rhythm is atrial flutter with a total intake of 4,555 mL and output of 1,001 mL. 

Physical examination findings include a supple neck with a jugular venous pressure of 10 cm, a point of maximal impulse located in the 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line, and normal heart sounds without murmurs or gallops. The patient has a midline ventral hernia but no other significant abnormalities noted. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Electrolytes are within normal range. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to statins and prednisone, as well as confusion and delirium associated with albuterol and arrhythmia/palpitations. The patient is on several medications including amiodarone, diltiazem, and morphine sulfate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and risk factors.
3. Nosocomial infection due to invasive lines and catheters.
4. Worsening renal function indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.
5. Electrolyte imbalance due to ongoing fluid losses and medication administration.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias due to underlying coronary artery disease and medications such as amiodarone.
7. Pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility and pressure from the nasogastric tube.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcers.
9. Sepsis or septic shock due to infection and inadequate immune response.
10. Prolonged sedation or delirium due to medications like morphine sulfate and diltiazem.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive analysis."

   RVR admitted from EP lab with pericardial effusion after PVI.
   .
   #  s/p  Code Blue for pulseless atrial fibrillation vs VT yesterday
   night: No subsequent acute events
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Monitor on telemetry closely
   -Has pain likely from chest compressions
 will continue PRN pain
   meds->avoid nsaids given ARF and GIBs
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion:  With tamponade physiology, hypotension during
   a fib ablation.  Likely from complication of procedure.  Pericardial
   drain placed and pulled. O2 sat off drain was 96%, likely origin was
   LA.  F/U Echo showed only trivial effusion following.
   - continue to hold coumadin for now
   - attempt to wean norepinephrine as able
   - consider TTE today to monitor development of effusion
   - Continue ctx for one more day
   .
   #. Hypotension: Cardiogenic: Initially likely secondary to tamponade,
   but now more likely secondary to a fib with RVR and decreased EF
   unclear etiology may be ischemic, consider cardiac cath when stable.
   Pt also had a Hct drop yesterday from 41 to 36 with guaiac positive
   stools thus could be hypovolemic however hcts since have been stable.
   - wean norepinephrine and start dopa instead for less tachycardia
   - Will check hct and give blood as needed, goal Hct > 30
   - Will monitor for volume overload and poor CO and give lasix as
   needed.
   .
   #. AF with RVR: Patient with long history of difficult to control AF
   and PVI was unable to be performed today given above.
   - continue digoxin for rate control
   - continue amiodarone drip, had to increase to 1mg/[**Last Name (LF) 83**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] change to
   PO eventually
   - monitor HRs on norepinephrine, attempt to wean as able
   - Will likely need a pacemaker eventually with AV node ablation
   - Continue ceflex
   - restart coumadin
   .
   #. Respiratory acidosis, acute on chronic:  Has poor lung function at
   baseline with severe COPD. Intubated for procedure but tolerated
   extubation fine.
   - Monitor closely.
   .
   #  ARF:  FeNa 0.1, did not improve with volume challenge.  Most likely
   renal failure is secondary to ATN from hypotension during code and
   currently on pressors.
   - Continue to monitor renal function
   - Avoid nephrotoxic drugs
   - If does not improve, will consult renal
   .
   #. COPD: Will continue home inhalers once extubated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation (AF) and right ventricular overload (RVR). He was admitted from the electrophysiology (EP) lab with pericardial effusion after a procedure for AF ablation. The patient experienced a code blue due to pulseless AF with ventricular tachycardia (VT) yesterday night, but there were no subsequent acute events.

The patient's pain is likely from chest compressions and will continue to be managed as needed with pain medication. Medications that may aggravate renal function or gastrointestinal bleeding should be avoided. The patient has a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, which is likely a complication of the procedure. A pericardial drain was placed and pulled, and an echocardiogram showed only trivial effusion afterward.

The patient's hypotension is initially thought to be secondary to tamponade, but it is now believed to be due to AF with RVR and decreased ejection fraction (EF), with unclear etiology possibly related to ischemic heart disease. A cardiac catheterization is being considered when the patient is stable. The patient also experienced a drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 41 to 36 with guaiac-positive stools, suggesting possible hypovolemia. However, Hcts have remained stable since then.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple admissions for difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation (AF) and right ventricular overload (RVR). He was admitted from the electrophysiology (EP) lab with a pericardial effusion after percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI). 

The patient experienced a pulseless sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) during the night, which required a code blue. He was successfully cardioverted, and his spontaneous circulation was regained. There have been no subsequent acute events since then.

The patient also had a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology during a fib ablation. The likely origin of the effusion was the left atrium (LA), and a pericardial drain was placed and pulled. An echocardiogram (Echo) showed only a trivial effusion following the procedure.

The patient's initial hypotension was likely secondary to tamponade but is now more likely secondary to AF with RVR and decreased ejection fraction (EF) compared to the previous Echo, unclear etiology that may be ischemic, and consideration for cardiac catheterization when stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   74yo M with with multiple admissions for difficult to control AF with
   RVR admitted from EP lab with pericardial effusion after PVI.
   .
   #  s/p  Code Blue for pulseless atrial fibrillation vs VT yesterday
   night: No subsequent acute events
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Monitor on telemetry closely
   -Has pain likely from chest compressions
 will continue PRN pain
   meds->avoid nsaids given ARF and GIBs
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion:  With tamponade physiology, hypotension during
   a fib ablation.  Likely from complication of procedure.  Pericardial
   drain placed and pulled. O2 sat off drain was 96%, likely origin was
   LA.  F/U Echo showed only trivial effusion following.
   - continue to hold coumadin for now
   - attempt to wean norepinephrine as able
   - consider TTE today to monitor development of effusion
   - Continue ctx for one more day
   .
   #. Hypotension: Cardiogenic: Initially likely secondary to tamponade,
   but now more likely secondary to a fib with RVR and decreased EF
   unclear etiology may be ischemic, consider cardiac cath when stable.
   Pt also had a Hct drop yesterday from 41 to 36 with guaiac positive
   stools thus could be hypovolemic however hcts since have been stable.
   - wean norepinephrine and start dopa instead for less tachycardia
   - Will check hct and give blood as needed, goal Hct > 30
   - Will monitor for volume overload and poor CO and give lasix as
   needed.
   .
   #. AF with RVR: Patient with long history of difficult to control AF
   and PVI was unable to be performed today given above.
   - continue digoxin for rate control
   - continue amiodarone drip, had to increase to 1mg/[**Last Name (LF) 83**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] change to
   PO eventually
   - monitor HRs on norepinephrine, attempt to wean as able
   - Will likely need a pacemaker eventually with AV node ablation
   - Continue ceflex
   - restart coumadin
   .
   #. Respiratory acidosis, acute on chronic:  Has poor lung function at
   baseline with severe COPD. Intubated for procedure but tolerated
   extubation fine.
   - Monitor closely.
   .
   #  ARF:  FeNa 0.1, did not improve with volume challenge.  Most likely
   renal failure is secondary to ATN from hypotension during code and
   currently on pressors.
   - Continue to monitor renal function
   - Avoid nephrotoxic drugs
   - If does not improve, will consult renal
   .
   #. COPD: Will continue home inhalers once extubated.
   .
   #. DM2: Will have ISS while hospitalized.
   .
   #. HTN: Currently hypotensive so will hold home BP meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation (AF) and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless VT during an electrophysiologist (EP) study for AF ablation. He underwent pericardiocentesis due to a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and had a cardiac catheterization. The patient also has COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and acute kidney injury (AKI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of AF and VT, and his current condition puts him at risk for further arrhythmias. Close monitoring on telemetry and continued use of antiarrhythmic medications like amiodarone are necessary.

2. Pericardial effusion: Although the patient has already undergone pericardiocentesis, there is a possibility of recurrent effusion. Regular follow-up echocardiograms should be done to monitor the development of effusion.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be secondary to cardiogenic shock due to tamponade or reduced ejection fraction (EF) caused by AF. Ischemic heart disease should also be considered, and a cardiac catheterization may be needed when the patient stabilizes.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the ICU with acute renal failure, mixed acidosis, ventricular tachycardia, and pericardial effusion. The patient has been experiencing delirium, diarrhea, and pain. He has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is exhibiting signs of delirium and confusion. This could be due to various factors such as medication side effects, metabolic imbalances, infection, or withdrawal symptoms. It is important to address this promptly as delirium can lead to increased risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and worsening of overall outcomes.
2. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing green liquid stools, which may indicate an infection. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection is a common cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients. A stool sample has been sent for C. diff testing. If positive, appropriate treatment with antibiotics like metronidazole or vancomycin should be initiated.
3. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output. ARF can have multiple causes, including dehydration, medications, sepsis, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation is needed to"

   Assessment and Plan
   74yo M with with multiple admissions for difficult to control AF with
   RVR admitted from EP lab with pericardial effusion after PVI.
   .
   #  s/p  Code Blue for pulseless atrial fibrillation vs VT yesterday
   night: No subsequent acute events
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Monitor on telemetry closely
   -Has pain likely from chest compressions
 will continue PRN pain
   meds->avoid nsaids given ARF and GIBs
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion:  With tamponade physiology, hypotension during
   a fib ablation.  Likely from complication of procedure.  Pericardial
   drain placed and pulled. O2 sat off drain was 96%, likely origin was
   LA.  F/U Echo showed only trivial effusion following.
   - continue to hold coumadin for now
   - attempt to wean norepinephrine as able
   - consider TTE today to monitor development of effusion
   - Continue ctx for one more day
   .
   #. Hypotension: Cardiogenic: Initially likely secondary to tamponade,
   but now more likely secondary to a fib with RVR and decreased EF
   unclear etiology may be ischemic, consider cardiac cath when stable.
   Pt also had a Hct drop yesterday from 41 to 36 with guaiac positive
   stools thus could be hypovolemic however hcts since have been stable.
   - wean norepinephrine and start dopa instead for less tachycardia
   - Will check hct and give blood as needed, goal Hct > 30
   - Will monitor for volume overload and poor CO and give lasix as
   needed.
   .
   #. AF with RVR: Patient with long history of difficult to control AF
   and PVI was unable to be performed today given above.
   - continue digoxin for rate control
   - continue amiodarone drip, had to increase to 1mg/[**Last Name (LF) 83**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] change to
   PO eventually
   - monitor HRs on norepinephrine, attempt to wean as able
   - Will likely need a pacemaker eventually with AV node ablation
   - Continue ceflex
   - restart coumadin
   .
   #. Respiratory acidosis, acute on chronic:  Has poor lung function at
   baseline with severe COPD. Intubated for procedure but tolerated
   extubation fine.
   - Monitor closely.
   .
   #  ARF:  FeNa 0.1, did not improve with volume challenge.  Most likely
   renal failure is secondary to ATN from hypotension during code and
   currently on pressors.
   - Continue to monitor renal function
   - Avoid nephrotoxic drugs
   - If does not improve, will consult renal
   .
   #. COPD: Will continue home inhalers once extubated.
   .
   #. DM2: Will have ISS while hospitalized.
   .
   #. HTN: Currently hypotensive so will hold home BP meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation and recent admission for pericardial effusion after a procedure. He was admitted from the electrophysiology lab with a pericardial effusion and experienced a code blue for pulseless atrial fibrillation versus ventricular tachycardia yesterday night. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

24-hour events include:
- Venous sheath pulled
- Restarted heparin drip and coumadin following
- Pt on 3mcg of dopamine, able to be discontinued in the afternoon
- HR up to the 130's at times, getting PO dilt, attempting IV dilt, dilt drip
- Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 161] requested one time additional dose of IV Dig 0.125 as level low, check repeat level in AM
- UA, urine Eos
- Having green liquid stools - sent for C diff
- Pt became acutely agitated at 3:30pm, attempted neb for SOB, morphine for pain
- Consulted Renal - likely ATN requesting urine protein crn ratio and renal US
- Decreased UOP overnight

The patient's current medications include:
- Diltiazem - 5 mg/hour
- Amiodarone - 1 mg/[Year (4 digits) 83]
- Heparin Sodium - 1,999 units/hour
- Morphine Sulfate - [2167-4-17] 03:15 AM
- Other medications: not specified

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications, including:
- AF with RVR: The patient has a long history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation. A procedure called PVI was unable to be performed today due to the patient's unstable condition.
- Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension was likely secondary to tamponade, but it is now more likely due to atrial fibrillation with reduced ventricular response and decreased ejection fraction. The etiology may be ischemic, and a cardiac catheterization may be considered when the patient is stable.
- Pericardial Effusion: The patient developed a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology during the ablation procedure. A pericardial drain was placed and pulled, and the origin was likely from the left atrium. A follow-up echocardiogram showed only trivial effusion.
- ARF: Acute renal failure is suspected due to the patient's history of recent hypotension during a code blue and current use of pressors. The patient has a low urine output and a high fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa).
- COPD: The patient has severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (C"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple admissions for difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was admitted from the electrophysiology lab with a pericardial effusion after a procedure called percutaneous vascular interruption (PVI). The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). 

The patient's recent events include the SHEATH - STOP event on [**2167-4-16**] 11:42 AM, where a venous sheath was pulled and restarted heparin and coumadin drips. The patient was on 3mcg of dopamine, which was able to be discontinued in the afternoon. His heart rate reached up to the 130's at times and he was given PO diltiazem and attempted IV diltiazem, eventually starting a diltiazem drip. Additionally, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] requested an additional dose of IV digoxin as the level was low, with a repeat level to be checked in the morning. 

The patient also experienced green liquid stools and a test for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) was sent. At 3:30pm, the patient became acutely agitated and received nebulized bronchodilators for shortness of breath"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation and recurrent ventricular response admitted from the electrophysiology lab with pericardial effusion after pulmonary vein isolation. The patient had a sheath pulled, restarted heparin and coumadin, and was on 3mcg of dopamine which could be discontinued in the afternoon. The patient's heart rate reached up to the 130's at times, and they attempted IV diltiazem, eventually transitioning to a diltiazem drip. They also requested an additional dose of IV digoxin as the level was low, with a plan to check the repeat level in the morning. The patient had green liquid stools and sent for C. difficile. They became acutely agitated at 3:30pm, attempted neb for shortness of breath, and morphine for pain. A consult was requested from renal for likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a request for urine protein creatinine ratio and renal US. The patient's urine output decreased overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion: The patient had a pericardial effusion after PVI, which has since resolved, and the drain was removed. However, there is a concern for potential recurrence.
2. AF with RVR: The patient has a long history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response"
