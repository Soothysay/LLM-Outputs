   Shock - wean levophed as tolerated, CVP apparently 25, hold off on
   volume resuscitation
   ARF - suspect ATN related to presenting illness, possible antibiotic
   effect, likely CVVH tomorrow for worsening creatinine, potassium and
   acidosis
   acidosis - likely CVVH tomorrow, bicarb drip, increase vent
   hyperkalemia - on bicarb drip, insulin drip along with D5, repleting
   calcium
   UTI - on antibiotics

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, hypoventilation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was found unresponsive in bed and admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient required intubation, bronchoscopy for a collapsed left lung, and was placed on antibiotics due to gram-positive cocci (GPC) and proteus in the urine. His condition worsened, leading to renal failure and hyperkalemia, for which he received kayexelate.

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa (sulfonamides), diarrhea related to anal surgery, pentothal (thiopental sodium), codeine, and confusion/delirium related to Wellbutrin (bupropion HCl). He is currently sedated and unable to provide his own history.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/68 mmHg to 115/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, hypoventilation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was found unresponsive in bed and admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient required intubation and bronchoscopic placement for a collapsed left lung. Cultures revealed gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the sputum and Proteus in the urine. During admission, the patient's creatinine levels rose, and acidosis worsened. He was transferred due to worsening renal function. Pressors were restarted yesterday, and the patient is currently receiving treatment for hyperkalemia.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, likely hypercarbic due to volume loss on the left side. This has since been corrected, but he still requires better ventilation, and it is planned to continue mechanical ventilation.

2. Shock: The patient shows signs of shock, and efforts are being made to wean off levophed as tolerated. The central venous pressure (CVP) is elevated, indicating volume overload, so further volume resuscitation has been held off.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's worsening creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which may be related to the presenting illness and antibiotic effects. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVV"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with acute respiratory failure and hypotension. She developed acute renal failure as well. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, mixed respiratory/metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and CV/hypotension. The patient has a history of diastolic and mild systolic dysfunction. She is being treated with various medications and therapies, including Combivent MDIs, pressor support, renal replacement therapy, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 108/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and responds to simple commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hyperkalemia: Elevated levels of potassium in the blood can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an imbalance in her body's acid-base levels, which can affect various organ functions.
5. Leukocytosis:"

   61 yo F with morbid obesity transferred from OSH where she presented

   and ARF.
   Repsiratory failure - Seemed likely to be hypoventilatory at first.
   Now needs large minute ventilation to compensate for metabolic
   acidosis.  Plateau pressures reasonable for now.
     -Continue current vent support, monitor for autopeep with rapid
   respiratory rate.
   Shock - currently on small amount of levophed with MAP's in the high
   80's.  Sepsis plus acidemia most likely culprits.  Possible sources
   include PNA, line infection, and possible c diff.
      -Wean pressors to off today.  Unclear if leukocytosis is related to
   illness or solumdrol that she had been on.
      -Follow up Cultures from OSH as well as cultures here.  Send C diff
      -Reasonable to continue Vanocmycin/Zosyn
      -Replace central line.
   ARF - suspect ATN related to presenting illness, possible antibiotic
   effect
     -Renal to see today for likely CVVH vs HD.
     -Renally dose meds.
   Acidosis - Continue IV bicarb and vent support until RRT is initiated
   Hyperkalemia - on bicarb drip, insulin drip along with D5, repleting
   calcium

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension,
   now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload
   requiring RRT.
   # Respiratory failure.   Based on report, appears it was hypercarbic
   [**2-11**] hypoventilation. There was initial concern for a pneumonia
   contributing to her respiratory failure, but this was not borne out in
   her microbiological dats from OSH. No e/o [**Doctor Last Name 2**] given satisfactory P/F
   ratios.
   -- would d/c vanc/zosyn today as no e/o PNA
   -- would allow for permissive hypercapnea to initiate some ventilatory
   drive in her
baseline PCO2 likely in 60-80 range
   -- wean off sedation and switch to PSV today
   - continue combivent MDIs q6h
   -- VAP ppx
   # Acute renal failure.  possibly due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Did have a proteus and citrobacter UTI, but less likely to
   contribute to her renal failure
   -- appreciate renal involvement, to continue on CCVH today
   -- lyte management per CVVH protocol
   -- would run negative today given her anasarca
   # Mixed Respiratory/Metabolic Acidosis
 now much improved with return
   to normal range pH with use of bicarb gtt and initiation of CVVH.
   -- would allow for permissive hypercapnea as above to avoid an
   alkalosis
   -- ask renal when ok to d/c bicarb gtt
   # Hyperkalemia.  Resolved, was [**2-11**] renal failure.
   # Leukocytosis
 much improved today, down to 10 from 22.
   -- f/u all culture dats (CVL, blood and urine cx)
   -- negative for C Diff
   -- could also be from solumedrol given at OSH
   -- trend WBC count
   -- monitor fever curve
   # ? COPD flare
 begun on steroids  at OSH.
   -- slow wean; start with 60mg IV Q8 x 3 days, then Q12 x 3 days, then
   Q24 x 3 days, then off
   # DM:  not on insulin at home
   -- was hypoglycemic this AM, given D50

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring RRT. She has a history of COPD and was given steroids at OSH. The patient is also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and is not on insulin at home.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 108/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on her current condition. These include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Close monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the ventilator settings accordingly is important.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is being used to manage her renal involvement.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has resolved hyperkalemia, which was likely related to her renal failure. Regular monitoring of potassium levels is essential to prevent further complications.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was transferred from another hospital due to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's course included shock and acute renal failure (ARF). Upon arrival, the patient required mechanical ventilation and CVVH due to metabolic acidosis. The patient has been weaned off pressors, completed antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and possible pneumonia, and had her central venous catheter replaced.

The patient's current condition shows improvement in respiratory failure, with optimization of PEEP to offset chest wall compliance. A pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial is planned today, targeting minute ventilation to allow permissive hypercapnia. Antibiotics have been stopped since there is no clear evidence of pneumonia. Steroids will be tapered over the coming days.

Regarding shock, the patient has been weaned off pressors and had completed antibiotic therapy for UTI and possible pneumonia. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) will continue today, aiming to transition to hemodialysis soon.

The patient's acidosis will be managed by weaning off IV bicarb to limit fluid intake. Hyperkalemia has resolved, and the patient is no longer on an insulin drip. Monitoring of free sugars and rhabdomyolysis serum levels is recommended if needed.

Other plans include nutrition support with Renal (Full) at 25 mL/hour, glycemic control, and prophyl"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was transferred from another hospital with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient also experienced shock and acute renal failure (ARF) during her course at the other hospital.

The patient's respiratory failure was initially thought to be hypoventilatory with left lung atelectasis and COPD flare. She required a large minute ventilation to compensate for metabolic acidosis, which improved with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Plateau pressures are currently reasonable, and efforts will be made to optimize positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to offset chest wall compliance.

A pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial will be conducted today, aiming to target minute ventilation to allow permissive hypercapnia. The baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) is reportedly in the 70's. Antibiotics will be stopped since there is no clear evidence of pneumonia (PNA) at this point. Steroids will also be weaned off, and the patient will be switched to prednisone 40mg today with a tapering schedule over the coming days.

In terms of shock, the patient has been weaned off pressors overnight. She had completed a course of antibiotics for urinary tract infection (UTI) and possible PNA at the previous hospital. A central venous catheter (CVC) has been replaced.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension,
   now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload
   requiring RRT.
   # Respiratory failure.   Based on report, appears it was hypercarbic
   [**2-11**] hypoventilation. There was initial concern for a pneumonia
   contributing to her respiratory failure, but this was not borne out in
   her microbiological dats from OSH. No e/o [**Doctor Last Name 2**] given satisfactory P/F
   ratios.
   -- d/c'd vanc/zosyn as no e/o PNA
   -- would allow for permissive hypercapnea to initiate some ventilatory
   drive in her
baseline PCO2 likely in 60-80 range
   -- wean off sedation and switch to PSV if tolerates
   - continue combivent MDIs q6h
   -- VAP ppx
   # Acute renal failure.  possibly due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Did have a proteus and citrobacter UTI, but less likely to
   contribute to her renal failure
   -- appreciate renal involvement, to continue on CCVH today
   -- lyte management per CVVH protocol
   -- would run negative today given her anasarca
   # Mixed Respiratory/Metabolic Acidosis
 now much improved with return
   to normal range pH with use of bicarb gtt (now off) and initiation of
   CVVH.
   -- would allow for permissive hypercapnea as above to avoid an
   alkalosis
   # Hyperkalemia.  Resolved, was [**2-11**] renal failure.
   # Leukocytosis
 much improved today, down to 10 from 22.  OSH cultures
   showed Coag-neg staph on BAL [**1-25**], as well as multi-drug sensitive
   citrobacter and proteus in urine
   -- f/u all culture dats (CVL, blood and urine cx)
   -- negative for C Diff
   -- could also be from solumedrol given at OSH
   -- trend WBC count
   -- monitor fever curve
   # ? COPD flare
 begun on steroids  at OSH.
   -- slow wean; start with 60mg IV Q8 x 3 days, then Q12 x 3 days, then
   Q24 x 3 days, then off
   # DM:  not on insulin at home
   -- d/c insulin gtt; on insulin sliding scale

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including renal failure, respiratory failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and possible COPD flare. She is currently in the ICU requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 163/64 mmHg to 177/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of potassium (K+), creatinine (Cr), lactate acid (Lac), and low levels of bicarbonate (HCO3-). The WBC count is slightly elevated at 8.7 K/uL. Imaging shows no evidence of pneumonia, but there is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient appears to have hypercarbic respiratory failure due to hypoventilation. Initially, there was concern for pneumonia contributing to her respiratory failure, but this was not confirmed by microbiological data. The patient is being weaned off sedation and switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV). Combivent MDIs are being continued every 6 hours, and VAP prophylaxis measures are in place.

2. Acute renal failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of renal and respiratory failure. She has been sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has several allergies, including sulfa, diarrhea, anal, pentothal, codeine, Wellbutrin, and confusion/delirium. She is currently on multiple medications and infusions.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient appears to have hypercarbic respiratory failure due to hypoventilation. Initial concerns of pneumonia contributing to respiratory failure were not supported by microbiological data. The patient's PaCO2 levels are likely in the range of 60-80.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient may have acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. The patient had a Proteus and Citrobacter urinary tract infection (UTI), but it is less likely to contribute to renal failure. Her urine eosinophils are negative.

3. Mixed Respiratory/Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had mixed respiratory/metabolic acidosis, which has now improved with the return to normal pH range using bicarbonate gtt and initiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). However, the patient is currently unable to excrete acid due to renal failure.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient had hyperkalemia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with morbid obesity transferred from OSH where she presented
   with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Course there c/b shock
   and ARF.
    Repsiratory failure - Seemed likely to be hypoventilatory at first
   with Left lung atelactasis/ COPD flare.  Needed large minute
   ventilation to compensate for metabolic acidosis which has improved
   with CVVH but she is still ""relatively acidemic"" compared to her
   baseline profound compensatory metabolic alkalosis.   Currently
   tolerating PSV today.
     -SBT today, will likely not extubate today as she will need to become
   more metabolically alkalemic before she can survive with her baseline
   minute ventilation.
     -Will taper steroids this week, starting with decrease to 20mg
   tomorrow.
    Shock - Remains off pressors over the last 36 hours.  Had completed
   course of abx for UTI and ?PNA at OSH.  CVC replaced.
     ARF - suspect ATN related to presenting illness, possible antibiotic
   effect.  Urine eos negative
     -CVVH filter clotted today.  Will hold on further CVVH for now and
   transition to HD.  Monitor pH/bicarb off of CVVH.
     -Renal dosing to meds.
    Hypogylcemia:  Now off insulin drip.
     -Monitor FS, RISS if needed.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital due to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. She also presented with shock and acute renal failure (ARF) at the referring hospital. Upon admission, she required large minute ventilation to compensate for metabolic acidosis, which has improved with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) but is still relatively acidemic compared to her baseline profound compensatory metabolic alkalosis. She is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) today and will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today. However, she is unlikely to be extubated today as she needs to become more metabolically alkalemic before she can survive with her baseline minute ventilation. The plan is to taper steroids this week, starting with a decrease to 20 mg tomorrow.

Regarding her shock, she remains off pressors for the last 36 hours. She had completed a course of antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and possible pneumonia (PNA) at the referring hospital. Her central venous catheter (CVC) has been replaced. Her acute renal failure is suspected to be associated with the presenting illness and possible antibiotic effect. Her urine eosinophils are negative. CVVH filter clotted today, and further CVVH will be held for now. She will transition to hemodialysis (HD) and monitor pH/bicarbonate"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with morbid obesity transferred from OSH where she presented
   with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Course there c/b shock
   and ARF.
    Repsiratory failure - Seemed likely to be hypoventilatory at first
   with Left lung atelactasis/ COPD flare.  Needed large minute
   ventilation to compensate for metabolic acidosis which has improved
   with CVVH but she is still ""relatively acidemic"" compared to her
   baseline profound compensatory metabolic alkalosis.   Currently
   tolerating PSV today.
     -SBT today, will likely not extubate today as she will need to become
   more metabolically alkalemic before she can survive with her baseline
   minute ventilation.
     -Will taper steroids this week, starting with decrease to 20mg
   tomorrow.
    Shock - Remains off pressors over the last 36 hours.  Had completed
   course of abx for UTI and ?PNA at OSH.  CVC replaced.
     ARF - suspect ATN related to presenting illness, possible antibiotic
   effect.  Urine eos negative
     -CVVH filter clotted today.  Will hold on further CVVH for now and
   transition to HD.  Monitor pH/bicarb off of CVVH.
     -Renal dosing to meds.
    Hypogylcemia:  Now off insulin drip.
     -Monitor FS, RISS if needed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was transferred from another hospital due to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. She presented with shock and acute renal failure (ARF) as well. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been in the ICU for an extended period of time.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls should be implemented to prevent this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to a potentially life-threatening PE. Prophylactic measures like subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be administered to reduce this risk.

3. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI): The patient has multiple lines, including arterial lines and dialysis catheters, which can increase the risk of CRBSI. Proper care and maintenance of these lines are crucial to prevent infection.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of ARF and is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). There is a risk of AKI"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently intubated and being mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has been off levophed for over 24 hours and has improved blood pressure. The CVVH filter clotted again, and the decision was made not to restart CVVH. Instead, renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis (HD) will be attempted. 

The patient had a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), but it was deemed unsuccessful due to insufficient respiratory reserve to compensate for the lack of renal excretion of H+. As a result, the patient remains intubated. The ventilator settings include a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, a respiratory rate (RR) set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and a respiratory system resistance compensation (RSBI) of 42. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 52, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 136, base excess of -26, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 340.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature (Tmax) of 37.9°C, heart rate (HR) of 89 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 103/50 mmHg to 181/87 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 28 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 5,791 mL and output of 6,793 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,002 mL. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 210 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.1 g/dL, glucose level of 177 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level of 4.4 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 140 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 99 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 27, BUN of 68 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 4.6 mg/dL, total bilirubin (TBili) of 30, and lactic acid level of 0."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and
   hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.   Likely secondary to hypercarbic respiratory
   failure in the setting of likely pneumonia. Currently with evidence of
   volume loss in the left lung on CXR with possible shifting of
   structures towards the left, raising suspicion for atelectasis and
   collapse of the LLL/lingual, perhaps due to mucous plugging.
   -- bronchoscopy today to evaluate left side
 BAL with culture
   -- d/c'd vanc/zosyn as no e/o PNA
   -- allow for permissive hypercapnea to initiate some ventilatory
   drive
baseline PCO2 likely in 60-80 range
   -- SBT- tolerated; however given her renal failure and inability to
   excrete acid, it is unlikely that she would be able to compensate from
   a resp standpoint given her poor reserve; therefore will remain
   intubated until renal fx improves or back on renal replacement therapy
   - continue combivent MDIs q6h
   -- VAP ppx
   # Acute renal failure.  likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Did have a proteus and citrobacter UTI, but less likely to
   contribute to her renal failure
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- urine eos negative
   -- holding on HD today, urine production has been good today, will
   reevaluate daily
   -- lyte management; tolerate K+ > 3 with gentle replacement below that
   -- goal negative when dialysis begins
   # Mixed Respiratory/Metabolic Acidosis
 now much improved with return
   to normal range pH with use of bicarb gtt (now off) and initiation of
   CVVH.  Did OK on SBT, but since dialysis on hold (CVVH filter clot), no
   way to excrete acid currently.
   -- would allow for permissive hypercapnea as above to avoid an
   alkalosis
   -- given her renal failure and inability to excrete acid, it is
   unlikely that she would be able to compensate from a respiratory
   standpoint given her poor reserve; therefore will remain intubated
   until renal fx improves or back on renal replacement therapy
   # Hyperkalemia.  Resolved, was [**2-11**] renal failure.
   # Leukocytosis
 resolved.    OSH cultures showed Coag-neg staph on BAL
   [**1-25**], as well as multi-drug sensitive citrobacter and proteus in
   urine.  Stopped Vanco/Zosyn
   -- f/u all culture dats (CVL, blood and urine cx)
   -- negative for C Diff
   -- could also be from solumedrol given at OSH; trying to taper this off
   (currenly on prednisone 40mg daily)
   -- trend WBC count
   -- monitor fever curve
   # ? COPD flare
 begun on steroids  at OSH.
   -- slow wean; now 40mg prednisone, switch to 20mg prednisone on [**2-4**] x
   3 days, then 20mg x 3 days, then off
   # DM:  not on insulin at home
   -- d/c insulin gtt; on insulin sliding scale (tightened [**2-3**])

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. She is now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). 

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by evidence of volume loss in the left lung on chest X-ray with possible shifting of structures towards the left, raising suspicion for atelectasis and collapse of the lower left lobe (lingual). Bronchoscopy has been planned to evaluate the left side and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) with culture will be performed. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and is on Combivent MDIs q6h. She also receives VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prophylaxis.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to ATN (acute tubular necrosis) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. She had a Proteus and Citrobacter urinary tract infection, but it is less likely to contribute to her renal failure. Renal involvement is appreciated, and urine eosinophils are negative. Hemodialysis is being held today as urine production has been good, and will be reevaluated daily. The patient's electrolyte management includes tolerating K+ > 3 with gentle replacement below that, and the goal is to achieve negative potassium when dialysis begins. 

The patient also has mixed respiratory/metabolic acidosis, which is now much improved with the return to normal range pH using bicarbonate gtt (now off) and initiation of CVVH. She tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial but given her renal failure and inability to excrete acid, it is unlikely that she would be able to compensate from a respiratory standpoint given her poor reserve. Therefore, she will remain intubated until renal function improves or she is back on renal replacement therapy.

Hyperkalemia has resolved, likely due to renal failure. Leukocytosis has also resolved. The patient has been treated for multiple infections including Coag-neg staph on BAL, as well as multi-drug sensitive Citrobacter and Proteus in urine. Vancomycin/Zosyn has been stopped, and follow-up on all culture dates (CVL, blood, and urine cx) is planned. The patient is negative for C Diff, and the cause of leukocytosis is being investigated further.

The patient is also being treated for a possible COPD flare, which began on steroids at OSH. The weaning plan includes slow wean, currently on prednisone 40mg daily, switching to 20mg prednisone on [**2-4**] x 3 days, then 20mg x 3 days, then off.

The patient has diabetes mellitus and is not on insulin at home. Insulin gtt has been discontinued,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, admitted for electrolyte and fluid disorder, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient was previously on levophed but has been off it for over 24 hours. The CVVH filter clotted again, and the decision was made not to restart CVVH due to improved blood pressure. Renal replacement therapy will be attempted instead.

The patient had a spontaneous breathing trial but did not feel she had enough respiratory reserve to compensate for the lack of renal excretion of hydrogen ions, so she was kept intubated. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/50 mmHg to 181/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her central venous pressure is 28 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance over the past 24 hours shows an input of 5,791 mL and output of 6,793 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,002 mL. She is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions, and other medications include heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and fentanyl.

The patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. She presented with shock and acute respiratory failure (ARF). The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation, currently set at CPAP/PSV mode with a set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 12 cmH2O, RR set at 20, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and RSBI of 42. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/43-181/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 inspiratory/min, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is on several medications including midazolam, fentanyl, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, peridex, colace, albuterol/atrovent, RISS, and prednisone. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for diarrhea, confusion/delirium, and nausea/vomiting. Her allergies include sulfa, codeine, and pentothal. The last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin/tazobactam at 04:39 AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was transferred from another hospital with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. She presented with shock and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's respiratory failure seems to be hypoventilatory initially, with left lung atelectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) flare-up. Current barriers to weaning include edema, effusion, left lower lobe (LLL) atelectasis, and chest wall stiffness.

Plan:
- Bronchoscopy will be performed to evaluate for endobronchial blockage of LLL with secretions.
- The patient will remain off antibiotics for now.
- Weaning of pressure support ventilation (PSV) with serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) will be continued.
- Tapering of prednisone this week will continue.
- For ARF, it is suspected to be associated with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) related to the presenting illness, possible antibiotic effect. Urine eosinophils are negative, and the patient is producing a lot of urine.
- Monitoring of volume status/urine output today without hemodialysis (HD) will be done. If unable to maintain negative volume balance, HD will be considered.
- The rest of the plan is per resident note.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient's nutritional needs will be addressed.
- Glycemic control will be"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and
   hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia. Remains intubated but doing well on
   CPAP/PS throughout yesterday and overnight. Continued need for
   intubation is mainly related to relative metabolic acidosis in the
   setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic
   alkalosis; patient likely does not have the respiratory reserve to
   compensate for the acid load as the result of her renal failure. Now
   with spiking temp and new infiltrate on CXR today (RLL appears worse,
   although official read is pulmonary edema; bronchoscopy yesterday with
   BAL from left side 1+polys and no organisms on gram stain), raises
   concern for VAP. Patient was on vanco/zosyn, but given negative culture
   data, these were d/c
   -- restart coverage for VAP with vanco/zosyn
   -- follow blood, sputum, urine, BAL cultures
   -- can attempt to use bicarb gtt (or lasix when more stable clinically)
   to push her acid-base status in the more alkalemic range to facilitate
   liberation from the vent
   -- allow for permissive hypercapnea to initiate ventilatory
   drive
baseline PCO2 likely in 60-80 range
   -- SBT- tolerated, continue daily
   - continue combivent MDIs q6h
   # Hypotension. Overnight, responded to 1.5L NS bolus and has remained
   stable. In the setting of new fevers. Monitor carefully for further
   signs of decompensation.
   # Volume Overload. Clinically overloaded. Overnight was hypotensive.
   Will hold on any diuresis until stabilized. I/O goal today even.
   # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Creatinine was trending down but bumped slightly
   overnight.
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- holding on HD again today, urine production was about 1.6L
   yesterday, currently about 30-60cc/hr now.
   -- lyte management; tolerate K+ > 3 with gentle replacement below that
   -- goal negative when dialysis begins
   # Chronic Respiratory Acidosis/Compensatory Metablic Alkalosis/Acute
   Metabolic Acidosis
on CVVH now off, holding on HD for now. See above
   discussion of use of bicarb gtt vs. lasix pending clinical stability.
   # Leukocytosis
 initially resolved, but with fevers, wbc bumped from 8
   to 11 with very slight left shift.  OSH cultures showed Coag-neg staph
   on BAL [**1-25**], as well as multi-drug sensitive citrobacter and proteus in
   urine.  Stopped Vanco/Zosyn initially, but have now restarted given new
   infiltrate and fevers.
   -- f/u all culture dats (CVL, blood and urine cx)
   -- negative for C Diff
   -- could also be from solumedrol given at OSH; trying to taper this off
   (currenly on prednisone 40mg daily)
   -- trend WBC count
   -- monitor fever curve
    # ? COPD flare
 begun on steroids  at OSH.
   -- slow wean; now 40mg prednisone, switch to 20mg prednisone on [**2-4**] x
   3 days, then 20mg x 3 days, then off
    # DM:  not on insulin at home
   -- d/c insulin gtt; on insulin sliding scale (tightened [**2-3**])

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. She is now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Summary of Progress:
- The patient remains intubated but is doing well on CPAP/PSV throughout yesterday and overnight.
- She developed a low-grade fever at 8 PM and was pan cultured.
- Blood pressure was labile, with MAPs falling into the 50s in the early evening. She responded well to IV fluids and received a total of 1.5 L NS bolus.
- A bronchoscopy was performed, showing mucous on the left side, and BAL pending.
- The patient has a new infiltrate on chest X-ray today (right lower lobe), which appears worse, although the official read is pulmonary edema.
- She has spiking temperatures and concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Previous antibiotic coverage was discontinued due to negative culture data, but has been restarted with vancomycin and zosyn.
- The patient's acid-base status is being monitored, and bicarb gtt or lasix may be used to push her acid-base status in the more alkalemic range to facilitate liberation from the vent.
- She tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and will continue daily attempts at weaning.
- The patient is on combivent MDIs q6h.
- Her hypotension responded to a 1.5 L NS bolus and has remained stable. She is being monitored for further signs of decompensation.
- She is clinically overloaded and hypotensive overnight. Diuretics will be held until stabilized.
- The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Her creatinine was trending down but bumped slightly overnight.
- Renal involvement is appreciated, and dialysis will be held again today. Urine production was about 1.6 L yesterday, currently about 30-60 cc/hr.
- Lyte management will tolerate K+ > 3 with gentle replacement below that. Goal is negative when dialysis begins.
- The patient has chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, acute metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, and possible COPD flare.
- She is being weaned off prednisone, which she was on for a suspected COPD flare.
- Her diabetes management will involve discontinuing insulin gtt and switching to insulin sliding scale, tightened on [**2-3**].
- The patient's ICU care includes nutrition via Nutren Renal (Full), glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen lines, dialysis catheter, DVT prophylaxis with SQ UF Heparin, and stress ulcer prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and
   hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.   Likely secondary to hypercarbic respiratory
   failure in the setting of likely pneumonia. Currently with evidence of
   volume loss in the left lung on CXR with possible shifting of
   structures towards the left, raising suspicion for atelectasis and
   collapse of the LLL/lingual, perhaps due to mucous plugging.
   -- bronchoscopy today to evaluate left side
 BAL with culture
   -- d/c'd vanc/zosyn as no e/o PNA
   -- allow for permissive hypercapnea to initiate some ventilatory
   drive
baseline PCO2 likely in 60-80 range
   -- SBT- tolerated; however given her renal failure and inability to
   excrete acid, it is unlikely that she would be able to compensate from
   a resp standpoint given her poor reserve; therefore will remain
   intubated until renal fx improves or back on renal replacement therapy
   - continue combivent MDIs q6h
   -- VAP ppx
   # Acute renal failure.  likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Did have a proteus and citrobacter UTI, but less likely to
   contribute to her renal failure
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- urine eos negative
   -- holding on HD today, urine production has been good today, will
   reevaluate daily
   -- lyte management; tolerate K+ > 3 with gentle replacement below that
   -- goal negative when dialysis begins
   # Mixed Respiratory/Metabolic Acidosis
 now much improved with return
   to normal range pH with use of bicarb gtt (now off) and initiation of
   CVVH.  Did OK on SBT, but since dialysis on hold (CVVH filter clot), no
   way to excrete acid currently.
   -- would allow for permissive hypercapnea as above to avoid an
   alkalosis
   -- given her renal failure and inability to excrete acid, it is
   unlikely that she would be able to compensate from a respiratory
   standpoint given her poor reserve; therefore will remain intubated
   until renal fx improves or back on renal replacement therapy
   # Hyperkalemia.  Resolved, was [**2-11**] renal failure.
   # Leukocytosis
 resolved.    OSH cultures showed Coag-neg staph on BAL
   [**1-25**], as well as multi-drug sensitive citrobacter and proteus in
   urine.  Stopped Vanco/Zosyn
   -- f/u all culture dats (CVL, blood and urine cx)
   -- negative for C Diff
   -- could also be from solumedrol given at OSH; trying to taper this off
   (currenly on prednisone 40mg daily)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has since been transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and likely secondary pneumonia. There is evidence of volume loss in the left lung on CXR, raising suspicion for atelectasis and collapse of the left lower lobe.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. There was a previous Proteus and Citrobacter urinary tract infection, but it is less likely to contribute to renal failure. The patient's urine eosinophils are negative, and hemodialysis (HD) is being held as the patient is producing urine well. The goal is to maintain potassium levels below 3 while awaiting renal recovery.
3. Mixed respiratory/metabolic acidosis: The patient's pH has improved with the use of bicarbonate gtt and initiation of CVVH. However, with the hold on dialysis due to a clotted filter, there is no way to excrete acid currently.
4. Hyperkalemia: Res"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa (sulfonamides), codeine, and pentothal (thiopental sodium), as well as nausea/vomiting and confusion/delirium associated with Wellbutrin (bupropion Hcl).

The patient underwent bronchoscopy with mucous noted on the left side and BAL pending. A blood culture was taken, and the patient developed a low-grade fever at 8 PM, which was pan cultured. Blood pressure has been labile, with MAPs falling into the 50's in the early evening. The patient responded well to IVF and received a total of 1.5 L NS bolus.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 107 bpm (66-111 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 138/61 mmHg to 164/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 29 cmH2O. The FiO2 is set at 40"

    Fever:  New rise in temperature and WBC count.  Change in CXR this
   AM.  Concern for VAP in this setting.  Less likely line infections.
     -F/u BAL, spend new sputum culture
     -Empric Vancomycin/Zosyn for now.
     -Follow up blood cultures
    Repsiratory failure - Seemed likely to be hypoventilatory at first
   with Left lung atelactasis/ COPD flare.  Current barriers include
   edema, effusion, LLL atelectasis ?new VAP, and chest wall stiffness.
     -Her bronchoscopy suggested bronchomalacia as well.
     -Empiric treatment for VAP as above
     -Once this new fever/hypotension resolved, will try to diurese.
     -Continue to taper prednisone this week.
   -- hold off on any attempts to extubate until she is stable form
   infection issues and able to defend her ability to protect airway
     ARF - suspect ATN related to presenting illness, possible antibiotic
   effect.  Urine eos negative.  Non-oliguric at present and likely in
   diuretic phase of ATN until sepsis/ hypotension developed.
     -Will monitor volume status/urine output today without HD
     -Volume goal even today.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who presented with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was transferred from another hospital where she experienced shock and acute respiratory failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy that revealed moderate bronchomalacia, mild hypotension overnight, and a spike in fever this morning.

The patient has multiple medical allergies including sulfa (sulfonamides), diarrhea; anal, pentothal (intraven.) (thiopental sodium), codeine, and nausea/vomiting. She is currently on various medications including midazolam (versed) at 4 mg/hour, fentanyl, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), peridex, albuterol, colace, and lansoprazole.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/54 mmHg to 89/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 22 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 207 K/uL, blood glucose level"

   edema, effusion, LLL atelectasis ?new VAP, and chest wall stiffness.
     -Her bronchoscopy suggested bronchomalacia as well.
     -Empiric treatment for VAP as above
     -Once this new fever/hypotension resolved, will try to diurese.
     -Continue to taper prednisone this week.
     ARF - suspect ATN related to presenting illness, possible antibiotic
   effect.  Urine eos negative.  Making a lot of urine lately.
     -Will monitor volume status/urine output today without HD
     -Volume goal even today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. She also presented with shock and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday, which revealed secretions in the left lower lobe and moderate bronchomalacia. She experienced mild hypotension overnight and had a spike in fever this morning. The patient has a history of allergies, including sulfa, diarrhea, pentothal, codeine, and confusion/delirium. She is currently on several medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, peridex, albuterol, colace, and lansoprazole. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/54 mmHg to 164/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 22 mmHg and fluid balance with an input of 3,283 mL and output of 1,677 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 53. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis,
   and volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia.  Slightly more hypoxemic overnight,
   possible etiologies include brewing VAP vs. mucous plugging (although
   vent pressures are not changed), vs. volume overload and vascular
   congestion. Mostly likely, the patient is volume overloaded, but her
   fevers are concerning for new pulmonary source for infection. Continued
   need for intubation is mainly related to relative metabolic acidosis in
   the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic
   alkalosis; patient likely does not have the respiratory reserve to
   compensate for the acid load as the result of her renal failure.
   Patient continues to spike through vanco/zosyn; given that she
   completed about 5-6 days of this regimen and that this could be
   hospital GNR
s at this point, we will expand to Meropenem.
   -- cover for VAP with vanco/meropenem
   -- follow blood, sputum, urine, BAL cultures
   -- lasix today now that BP is stable; will help to correct acid base
   status in an effort to optimize extubation
   -- allow for permissive hypercapnea to initiate ventilatory
   drive
baseline PCO2 likely in 60-80 range
   -- monitor ABG
   -- SBT- tolerated, continue daily
   -- continue combivent MDIs q6h
   # Hypotension. Stable, no further episodes
   # Volume Overload. Clinically overloaded. Will attempt diuresis today
   with lasix.
   # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Creatinine was trending down but  now continues to rise
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- holding on HD again today, urine production was about 1.6L
   yesterday, currently about 30-60cc/hr now.
   -- lyte management; tolerate K+ > 3 with gentle replacement below that
   -- goal negative by 500cc to 1L today
   # Chronic Respiratory Acidosis/Compensatory Metablic Alkalosis/Acute
   Metabolic Acidosis
was on CVVH now off, holding on HD for now. Will
   try to diurese today.
   # Leukocytosis
 initially resolved, but with fevers, wbc bumped from 8
   to 11 with very slight left shift.  OSH cultures showed Coag-neg staph
   on BAL [**1-25**], as well as multi-drug sensitive citrobacter and proteus in
   urine.  Stopped Vanco/Zosyn initially, but restarted given fevers. ?
   drug reaction with maculopapular rash over back with fevers. Switched
   zosyn to Meropenem and will send for diff to look for peripheral
   eosinophilia.
   -- f/u all culture dats (CVL, blood and urine cx)
   -- d/c prednisone today
   -- trend WBC count
   -- monitor fever curve
    # ? COPD flare
 begun on steroids  at OSH.
   -- slow wean; last dose of 20mg today.
    # DM:  not on insulin at home. FS range in high 100
s mostly. Can
   tighten scale slightly today.
   -- d/c insulin gtt; on insulin sliding scale (tightened [**2-3**])
   # FEN: diuresing today; TF
s at goal. Replete lytes with caution given
   renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She was initially admitted for hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, along with hypotension. She is now transferred to the ICU with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient has ongoing respiratory failure due to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of likely pneumonia. There is a slight increase in hypoxemia overnight, and possible etiologies include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), mucous plugging, or volume overload. The patient's fevers are concerning for a new pulmonary source of infection. Continued need for intubation is mainly related to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

The patient continues to spike fevers despite being on vancomycin and zosyn, so meropenem has been added to cover hospital-acquired Gram-negative rods. Blood, sputum, urine, and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures have been sent. Lasix will be given today to correct the acid-base status and optimize extubation. Permissive hypercapnea will be allowed to initiate ventilatory drive, with a baseline PCO2 likely in the 60-80 range. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) will be continued, and Combivent MDIs will be given every"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis,
   and volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia.  Slightly more hypoxemic overnight,
   possible etiologies include brewing VAP vs. mucous plugging (although
   vent pressures are not changed), vs. volume overload and vascular
   congestion. Mostly likely, the patient is volume overloaded, but her
   fevers are concerning for new pulmonary source for infection. Continued
   need for intubation is mainly related to relative metabolic acidosis in
   the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic
   alkalosis; patient likely does not have the respiratory reserve to
   compensate for the acid load as the result of her renal failure.
   Patient continues to spike through vanco/zosyn; given that she
   completed about 5-6 days of this regimen and that this could be
   hospital GNR
s at this point, we will expand to Meropenem.
   -- cover for VAP with vanco/meropenem
   -- follow blood, sputum, urine, BAL cultures
   -- lasix today now that BP is stable; will help to correct acid base
   status in an effort to optimize extubation
   -- allow for permissive hypercapnea to initiate ventilatory
   drive
baseline PCO2 likely in 60-80 range
   -- monitor ABG
   -- SBT- tolerated, continue daily
   -- continue combivent MDIs q6h
   # Hypotension. Stable, no further episodes
   # Volume Overload. Clinically overloaded. Will attempt diuresis today
   with lasix.
   # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Creatinine was trending down but  now continues to rise
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- holding on HD again today, urine production was about 1.6L
   yesterday, currently about 30-60cc/hr now.
   -- lyte management; tolerate K+ > 3 with gentle replacement below that
   -- goal negative by 500cc to 1L today
   # Chronic Respiratory Acidosis/Compensatory Metablic Alkalosis/Acute
   Metabolic Acidosis
was on CVVH now off, holding on HD for now. Will
   try to diurese today.
   # Leukocytosis
 initially resolved, but with fevers, wbc bumped from 8
   to 11 with very slight left shift.  OSH cultures showed Coag-neg staph
   on BAL [**1-25**], as well as multi-drug sensitive citrobacter and proteus in
   urine.  Stopped Vanco/Zosyn initially, but restarted given fevers. ?
   drug reaction with maculopapular rash over back with fevers. Switched
   zosyn to Meropenem and will send for diff to look for peripheral
   eosinophilia.
   -- f/u all culture dats (CVL, blood and urine cx)
   -- d/c prednisone today
   -- trend WBC count
   -- monitor fever curve
    # ? COPD flare
 begun on steroids  at OSH.
   -- slow wean; last dose of 20mg today.
    # DM:  not on insulin at home. FS range in high 100

   tighten scale slightly today.
   -- d/c insulin gtt; on insulin sliding scale (tightened [**2-3**])
   # FEN: diuresing today; TF

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. She has been transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She remains intubated due to respiratory failure, secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of likely pneumonia. The patient's fevers are concerning for a new pulmonary source of infection. She has leukocytosis with a left shift and positive cultures for coag-neg staph on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), as well as multi-drug sensitive citrobacter and proteus in urine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require intubation and mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient is being covered with vancomycin and meropenem.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Her creatinine is rising, and she is oliguric with a urine output of 30-60 cc/hr.
3. Volume Overload: The patient is clinically overloaded, and diuresis with lasix is planned"

   with spiking temp and new infiltrate on CXR today (RLL appears worse,
   although official read is pulmonary edema; bronchoscopy yesterday with
   BAL from left side 1+polys and no organisms on gram stain), raises
   concern for VAP. Patient was on vanco/zosyn, but given negative culture
   data, these were d/c
   -- restart coverage for VAP with vanco/zosyn
   -- follow blood, sputum, urine, BAL cultures
   -- can attempt to use bicarb gtt (or lasix when more stable clinically)
   to push her acid-base status in the more alkalemic range to facilitate
   liberation from the vent
   -- allow for permissive hypercapnea to initiate ventilatory
   drive
baseline PCO2 likely in 60-80 range
   -- SBT- tolerated, continue daily
   - continue combivent MDIs q6h
   # Hypotension. Overnight, responded to 1.5L NS bolus and has remained
   stable. In the setting of new fevers. Monitor carefully for further
   signs of decompensation.
   # Volume Overload. Clinically overloaded. Overnight was hypotensive.
   Will hold on any diuresis until stabilized. I/O goal today even.
   # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Creatinine was trending down but bumped slightly
   overnight.
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- holding on HD again today, urine production was about 1.6L
   yesterday, currently about 30-60cc/hr now.
   -- lyte management; tolerate K+ > 3 with gentle replacement below that
   -- goal negative when dialysis begins
   # Chronic Respiratory Acidosis/Compensatory Metablic Alkalosis/Acute
   Metabolic Acidosis
on CVVH now off, holding on HD for now. See above
   discussion of use of bicarb gtt vs. lasix pending clinical stability.
   # Leukocytosis
 initially resolved, but with fevers, wbc bumped from 8
   to 11 with very slight left shift.  OSH cultures showed Coag-neg staph
   on BAL [**1-25**], as well as multi-drug sensitive citrobacter and proteus in
   urine.  Stopped Vanco/Zosyn initially, but have now restarted given new
   infiltrate and fevers.
   -- f/u all culture dats (CVL, blood and urine cx)
   -- negative for C Diff
   -- could also be from solumedrol given at OSH; trying to taper this off
   (currenly on prednisone 40mg daily)
   -- trend WBC count
   -- monitor fever curve
    # ? COPD flare
 begun on steroids  at OSH.
   -- slow wean; now 40mg prednisone, switch to 20mg prednisone on [**2-4**] x

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. She was transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient remains intubated but is doing well on CPAP/PSV throughout yesterday and overnight. She has a fever and new infiltrate on chest X-ray today, raising concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient was previously on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, but these antibiotics were discontinued due to negative culture data. Coverage for VAP has been restarted with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of likely pneumonia. Continued need for intubation is mainly related to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. The patient likely does not have the respiratory reserve to compensate for the acid load as a result of her renal failure. 

The patient's hypotension responded to a 1.5L normal saline bolus and has remained stable. However, she is clinically overloaded, and any diuresis will be held until she is stabilized. 

The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was transferred from another hospital with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's course included shock and acute renal failure. She presented with hypoventilatory respiratory failure initially, which was later found to be due to left lung atelectasis and COPD flare. 

The current barriers to respiratory improvement include pulmonary edema, effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis, possible new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and chest wall stiffness. A bronchoscopy was performed, which suggested bronchomalacia. 

The patient's treatment plan includes empiric treatment for VAP with vancomycin and zosyn, restarted due to a fever overnight. The antibiotics will be expanded to include meropenem. The patient will be tried on diuretics today, and the tapering of prednisone will continue this week. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) will be attempted if possible, considering the patient's respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's acute renal failure is suspected to be related to the presenting illness, and diuretics will be used today to address this issue. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) will be discontinued. Optimization of antibiotic doses will be pursued. 

Other aspects of the patient's ICU care include nutrition with a renal formula provided by Nutren Renal at a rate of 35"

   overnight. Expand to Vanc and Meropenem.
   - Try to diurese today.
     -Continue to taper prednisone this week.
   -- try daily SBT if possible: resp + metabolic acidosis and metabolic

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was transferred from another hospital with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient also had shock and acute renal failure. Upon arrival, she was intubated due to respiratory failure, which initially seemed to be hypoventilatory with left lung atelectasis/COPD flare. Current barriers to ventilation include edema, effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis, potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and chest wall stiffness with wheeze. A bronchoscopy was performed, suggesting bronchomalacia. Empiric treatment for VAP was started, and the patient's fever overnight prompted a change in antibiotics.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, which is suspected to be associated with the presenting illness. Diuretics will be attempted today, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) will be discontinued. Antibiotic doses will be optimized. If diuresis does not work, the patient will be considered for discontinuation within 24 hours.

Other assessments and plans include electrolyte and fluid disorders, respiratory failure, hypotension (not in shock), hyperkalemia (high potassium), and morbid obesity. The patient's condition requires critical care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen lines, dialysis catheter, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention measures"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis,
   and volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia.  Continued need for intubation is
   mainly related to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic
   respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis; patient
   likely does not have the respiratory reserve to compensate for the acid
   load as the result of her renal failure.  Renal has recommended to
   treat with lasix to increased serum bicarbonate.  Patient was placed on
   a lasix drip with good response.  Patient continued to spike through
   vanco/zosyn and has now been broadened to Vanco/Meropenem.  Sputum and
   urine cultures growing yeast will start fluconazole today
   -- cover for VAP with vanco/meropenem
   -- start fluconazole today
   -- follow blood, sputum, urine, BAL cultures
   -- cont lasix gtt with goal -1L
 1.5L
   -- allow for permissive hypercapnea to initiate ventilatory
   drive
baseline PCO2 likely in 60-80 range
   -- monitor ABG
   -- SBT- not tolerated this morning, continue daily
   -- continue combivent MDIs q6h
   # Hypotension. Stable, no further episodes
   # Volume Overload. Clinically overloaded. Will attempt diuresis today
   with lasix as above
   -- cont lasix gtt.
   -- goal net -1L to 1.5L today
   # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Creatinine was initially trending down but  now continues
   to rise
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- holding on HD again today as patient is producing good urine with
   lasix
   -- follow lytes
   # Chronic Respiratory Acidosis/Compensatory Metablic Alkalosis/Acute
   Metabolic Acidosis
was on CVVH now off, holding on HD for now. Will
   try to diurese today.
   # Leukocytosis
 initially resolved, but with fevers, wbc bumped from 8
   to 11 with very slight left shift.  OSH cultures showed Coag-neg staph
   on BAL [**1-25**], as well as multi-drug sensitive citrobacter and proteus in
   urine.  Stopped Vanco/Zosyn initially, but restarted given fevers. ?
   drug reaction with maculopapular rash over back with fevers. Switched
   zosyn to Meropenem as above
   -- f/u all culture dats (CVL, blood and urine cx)
   -- trend WBC count
   -- monitor fever curve
    # ? COPD flare
 begun on steroids  at OSH.
   -- weaned off ot steroids
    # DM:  not on insulin at home.
   -- cont insulin SS
   # FEN: diuresing today; TF
s at goal. Replete lytes with caution given
   renal failure.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely secondary to her underlying respiratory condition, and has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and meropenem to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Additionally, fluconazole has been started to cover for yeast infections in the sputum and urine.

The patient is still intubated and requires mechanical ventilation due to her inability to compensate for metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis. Lasix has been initiated to increase serum bicarbonate levels and promote diuresis.

The patient has leukocytosis with a slight left shift and fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Cultures have shown growth of coag-neg staph, multi-drug sensitive citrobacter, and proteus.

Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, which is being managed with insulin, and a possible COPD flare that has been treated with steroids.

The patient is being closely monitored with daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and permissive hypercapnea is being allowed to initiate ventilatory drive. Tube feeds have been initiated, and glycemic control is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who presented with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and was transferred from another hospital. The patient experienced shock and acute renal failure during her course of treatment. She is currently diagnosed with respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute renal failure, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to hypoventilation initially, but subsequent findings suggest other causes such as edema, effusion, left lung atelectasis, new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), chest wall stiffness, wheeze, and bronchomalacia. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem for infection, and fluconazole has been added to address yeast growth in sputum and urine. The medical team is also monitoring vancomycin levels and continuing diuresis.

Regarding the acute renal failure, it is suspected to be associated with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) related to the presenting illness. Diuretics are being tried, and the medical team is closely monitoring creatinine levels. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been discontinued.

The patient's fever is being managed by changing antibiotics and looking for potential causes of infection in the ICU, including drug fever, catheter-related bloodstream infection, and Clostridium difficile infection. The medical team is also"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's course includes shock and acute renal failure (ARF). She is currently experiencing respiratory failure with metabolic acidosis, hypoventilation, left lung atelectasis/COPD flare, edema, effusion, and bronchomalacia. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem antibiotics, and fluconazole for yeast in sputum and urine. She is also receiving diuretics and daily sedation/analgesia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and new lung infiltrates may suggest this complication.
2. Ventricular assist device (VAD) malfunction: The patient's TTE was negative for vegetations, but it does not rule out the possibility of VAD malfunction. Monitoring of VAD function and regular assessment are necessary.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has multiple lines and catheters, including an arterial line, multi-lumen catheter, and dialysis catheter. These can serve as potential sources of infection, leading to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rising creat"

   61 yof with morbid obesity, transferred here with hypercarbid
   respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia.  Continued need for intubation is
   mainly related to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic
   respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis; patient
   likely does not have the respiratory reserve to compensate for the acid
   load as the result of her renal failure.  Renal has recommended to
   treat with lasix to increased serum bicarbonate.  Patient was placed on
   a lasix drip with good response.  Patient continued to spike through
   vanco/zosyn and has now been broadened to Vanco/Meropenem.  Sputum and
   urine cultures growing yeast will start fluconazole today

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old with morbid obesity, who was transferred to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. They have been intubated and sedated due to severe pneumonia and respiratory acidosis. The patient's condition is complicated by acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Other medical complications include leukocytosis, chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, acute metabolic acidosis, hypotension, volume overload, and potential COPD flare.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of likely pneumonia. Continued need for intubation is mainly related to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. The patient likely does not have the respiratory reserve to compensate for the acid load as the result of their renal failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile and cultures growing yeast, indicating a possible yeast infection. They have also been treated with vancomycin and meropenem for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to ATN in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Their creatinine levels have been"

2. Hypotension: The patient had stable hypotension, but no further episodes have been reported.

3. Volume Overload: The patient is clinically overloaded and will attempt diuresis today with Lasix to reduce fluid intake.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis,
   and volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia.  She continues with the need for
   intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic
   respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.   Current
   plan has been to diurese her with a goal of improving metabolic
   acidosis.    If patient does not improve over the weekend then plan
   will be for Tracheostomy on Monday.  Husband, who is HCP was called
   today and will make a decision by Monday.
   -- cover for VAP with vanco/meropenem
   -- start fluconazole for yeast in sputum and urine
   -- follow blood, sputum, urine, BAL cultures
   -- cont lasix gtt with goal -1L
 1.5L
   -- monitor ABG
   -- SBT- not tolerated again this morning, continue daily
   -- continue combivent MDIs q6h
   # Volume Overload. Likely in setting of IVF resuscitation over the last
   few weeks in the ICU.  Will attempt diuresis as above
   -- cont lasix gtt.
   -- goal net -1L to 1.5L today
   # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Creatinine was initially trending down but  now continues
   to rise
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- follow lytes
   # Chronic Respiratory Acidosis/Compensatory Metablic Alkalosis/Acute
   Metabolic Acidosis
was on CVVH now off, holding on HD for now. Will
   try to diurese today as above
    # DM:  not on insulin at home.
   -- cont insulin SS
   # FEN: diuresing today; TF

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted for hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure with hypotension. She has now developed acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload, requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She continues to require intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. The current plan is to diurese her to improve metabolic acidosis. If there is no improvement over the weekend, a tracheostomy will be considered. She has also been started on fluconazole for yeast in sputum and urine, and her blood, sputum, urine, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures are being followed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia. She continues to need intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. If she does not improve, a tracheostomy may be planned.

2. Volume Overload: The patient is likely experiencing volume overload due to intravenous fluid resuscitation over the last few weeks in the ICU. The plan is to attempt diuresis using lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of -1L to 1"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity, presenting with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has a history of shock and acute renal failure. Currently, she is experiencing failure to wean from the ventilator with yeast from sputum and urine, raising concerns of potential fungemia. The patient's respiratory failure is associated with metabolic and respiratory acidosis, edema, effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis, possible fungal infection, chest wall stiffness, and wheeze. A bronchoscopy suggested bronchomalacia as well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator, which indicates ongoing respiratory failure. There are several factors contributing to this, including metabolic and respiratory acidosis, edema, effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis, possible fungal infection, chest wall stiffness, and wheeze. These complications may further impair the patient's ability to breathe independently.

2. Fungemia: The presence of yeast in the sputum and urine suggests the possibility of fungemia. If confirmed, this could lead to systemic fungal infection and additional complications such as sepsis.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of ARF, which is likely related to the presenting illness. She is now in the post-ATN diuretic phase, making a lot of urine but with stable creat"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who was transferred from another hospital with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. She had shock and acute renal failure in the past, and now she is experiencing failure to wean from the ventilator, yeast from sputum and urine, and suspected fungemia. She is currently being treated with antibiotics, antifungal medication, and has had a bronchoscopy that suggested bronchomalacia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, as she has difficulty weaning off the ventilator. This may indicate severe lung damage or dysfunction.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of acute renal failure and is showing signs of ongoing kidney dysfunction, such as elevated creatinine levels and fluid overload.
3. Fungemia: The presence of yeast in the sputum and urine raises the possibility of systemic fungal infection, which could lead to fungemia.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.
6. Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI): With multiple lines and catheters in"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with morbid obesity who presented with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was transferred from another hospital where she experienced shock and acute renal failure. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with metabolic acidosis, suspected hypoventilation, left lung atelectasis/COPD flare, edema, effusion, lower lobe atelectasis, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), chest wall stiffness, and wheeze. A bronchoscopic examination revealed bronchomalacia. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem, and additional fluconazole has been added due to the presence of yeast in her sputum and urine. 

The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI) and is experiencing fever. Antibiotics have been changed, and the healthcare team is looking for potential causes of fever in the ICU, such as central lines and Clostridium difficile infection. 

Other notable findings include hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) and an altered mental status, with intermittent delirium. The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has been weaned off prednisone. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), blood pressure ranging from 129/54 mmHg to 170/78 mmHg, heart rate between 73"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis,
   and volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia.  She continues with the need for
   intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic
   respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.   However,
   metabolic acidosis has improved over the past 24 hours.  Plan is to
   continue with diuresis for removal of total body overload.  If she
   continues to improve then plan will be for possible extubation
   tomorrow.    If not then plan  will be for Tracheostomy on Monday.
   Husband, who is HCP was called today and will make a decision by
   Monday.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted for hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient continues to require intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to mechanical ventilation. Coverage with vancomycin and meropenem has been initiated to prevent this.

2. Volume overload: The patient has shown signs of volume overload, likely due to IV fluid resuscitation. Diuretics will be used to manage this condition.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has declined, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is necessary.

4. Chronic respiratory acidosis/compensatory metabolic alkalosis/acute metabolic acidosis: The patient's respiratory condition has led to chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. However, an acute metabolic acidosis has also developed. CVVH will be used to manage this condition.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis,
   and volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia.  She continues with the need for
   intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic
   respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.   Current
   plan has been to diurese her with a goal of improving metabolic
   acidosis.    If patient does not improve over the weekend then plan
   will be for Tracheostomy on Monday.  Husband, who is HCP was called
   today and will make a decision by Monday.
   -- cover for VAP with vanco/meropenem
   -- start fluconazole for yeast in sputum and urine
   -- follow blood, sputum, urine, BAL cultures
   -- cont lasix gtt with goal -1L
 1.5L
   -- monitor ABG
   -- SBT- not tolerated again this morning, continue daily
   -- continue combivent MDIs q6h
    # Volume Overload. Likely in setting of IVF resuscitation over the
   last few weeks in the ICU.  Will attempt diuresis as above
   -- cont lasix gtt.
   -- goal net -1L to 1.5L today
    # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Creatinine was initially trending down but  now continues
   to rise
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- follow lytes
    # Chronic Respiratory Acidosis/Compensatory Metablic Alkalosis/Acute
   Metabolic Acidosis
was on CVVH now off, holding on HD for now. Will
   try to diurese today as above
   # DM:  not on insulin at home.
   -- cont insulin SS
    # FEN: diuresing today; TF
s at goal. Replete lytes with caution given
   renal failure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted for hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. If the patient does not improve over the weekend, a plan for tracheostomy on Monday will be made after discussing it with the husband, who is a healthcare professional.

2. Volume overload: The patient likely has volume overload, possibly due to IV fluid resuscitation over the last few weeks in the ICU. Diuresis with Lasix will be attempted to address this issue.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Creatinine was initially trending down but now continues to rise. Renal involvement should be closely monitored, and electrolyte levels should be followed.

4. Chronic respiratory acidosis/compensatory metabolic alkalosis/acute metabolic acidosis: The patient has chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, along with acute metabolic acidosis. CV"

   61 year old woman with obesity hypoventilation, ARF, possible VAP. Plan
   as per resident note. Briefly, on broad empiric therapy for possible
   VAP. Will add levofloxacin
   today for a second gram negative [**Doctor Last Name 23**]. Appears to be doing well on SBT
   today (RSBI ~80). Will try prolonged SBT today and check gas. If still
   febrile and not making progress
   off the vent will check CT. Continue fluc for now, awaiting speciation
   of yeast in sputm and urine. No indication for RRT at this time. Wil
   aim for some diuresis despite hypernatremia (which we will correcrt
   with free water). Further plans as per resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of obesity hypoventilation, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and hypotension. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has been on broad empiric therapy for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She appears to be doing well on a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with a respiratory support burden index (RSBI) of around 80. The plan is to try prolonged SBT today and check gas exchange. If the patient remains febrile and not making progress off the ventilator, a chest CT will be done. The patient will continue on fluc for now, awaiting the species of yeast in sputum and urine. No indication for renal replacement therapy (RRT) at this time. The goal is to achieve some diuresis despite hypernatremia, which will be corrected with free water. Further plans will be as per the resident note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Broad empiric therapy has been initiated, but there is still a possibility of developing or progressing VAP.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate potential AKI. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old woman with obesity hypoventilation, ARF, possible VAP. Plan
   as per resident note. Briefly, on broad empiric therapy for possible
   VAP. Will add levofloxacin
   today for a second gram negative [**Doctor Last Name 23**]. Appears to be doing well on SBT
   today (RSBI ~80). Will try prolonged SBT today and check gas. If still
   febrile and not making progress
   off the vent will check CT. Continue fluc for now, awaiting speciation
   of yeast in sputm and urine. No indication for RRT at this time. Wil
   aim for some diuresis despite hypernatremia (which we will correcrt
   with free water). Further plans as per resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of obesity hypoventilation, admitted with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- She has been complicated by acute respiratory failure (ARF) and hypotension.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.
- She has developed a fever and is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 114/67 to 147/111 mmHg, heart rate between 74-101 bpm, respiratory rate of 15-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- She has received broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically for possible VAP and will add levofloxacin today for gram-negative coverage.
- The patient appears to be doing well on spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of approximately 80.
- The plan is to continue SBT and check gas exchange. If the patient remains febrile and not making progress off the ventilator, a chest CT will be performed.
- She will continue on fluc for now, awaiting speciation of yeast in sputum and urine.
- There is no indication for renal replacement therapy (RRT) at this time.
- The goal is to achieve some diuresis despite hypernatremia, which will be corrected with"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis,
   and volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia.  She continues with the need for
   intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic
   respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.   However,
   metabolic acidosis has improved over the past 24 hours.  Plan is to
   continue with diuresis for removal of total body overload.  If she
   continues to improve then plan will be for possible extubation
   tomorrow.    If not then plan  will be for Tracheostomy on Monday.
   Husband, who is HCP was called today and will make a decision by
   Monday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. She is now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring CVVH. The patient continues to require intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, now secondary to pneumonia. She continues to need intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure due to ATN in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Creatinine was initially trending down but now continues to rise.
3. Volume overload: The patient has volume overload requiring CVVH. Diuresis is being attempted to remove total body overload.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely in the setting of diuresis. Diuresis will be continued, and 1L free water via PEG will be added for correction of hypernatremia.
5. Chronic respiratory acidosis/compensatory metabolic alkalosis/acute metabolic acidosis: The patient was on CVVH now off, holding on HD for now. Diuresis will be tried today as above.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient is not on insulin at home, so continuous insulin sliding scale will be continued.
7. Feeding: The patient is receiving Nutren Renal (Full) at 35 mL/hour.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis with SQ UF Heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prophylaxis with HOB elevation, mouth care, daily wake up, and RSBI."

   intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic
   respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.   However,
   metabolic acidosis has improved over the past 24 hours.  Plan is to
   continue with diuresis for removal of total body overload.  If she
   continues to improve then plan will be for possible extubation
   tomorrow.    If not then plan  will be for Tracheostomy on Monday.
   Husband, who is HCP was called today and will make a decision by

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload. She is currently in the ICU requiring mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of likely pneumonia. The patient also has chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis and an acute metabolic acidosis that has improved over the past 24 hours. The plan is to continue with diuresis for removal of total body overload. If she continues to improve, the plan is for possible extubation tomorrow. If not, a tracheostomy will be performed on Monday. The patient has several other medical conditions including acute renal failure, volume overload, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus, and stress ulcers. She is currently receiving various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, she is at risk for developing VAP. Covering for VAP with vancomycin and meropenem is recommended.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with rising creatinine levels, indicating potential AKI. Monitoring renal function and following electrolytes is important.
3. Volume overload: The patient has volume overload, which can lead to congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema."

   metabolic acidosis has improved over the past 24 hours.  Plan is to
   continue with diuresis for removal of total body overload.  If she
   continues to improve then plan will be for possible extubation
   tomorrow.    If not then plan  will be for Tracheostomy on Monday.
   Husband, who is HCP was called today and will make a decision by

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis,
   and volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia.  She continues with the need for
   intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic
   respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.   However,
   metabolic acidosis has improved over the past 24 hours.  Plan is to
   continue with diuresis for removal of total body overload.  If she
   continues to improve then plan will be for possible extubation
   tomorrow.    If not then plan  will be for Tracheostomy on Monday.
   Husband, who is HCP was called today and will make a decision by
   Monday.

    # Volume Overload. Likely in setting of IVF resuscitation over the
   last few weeks in the ICU.  Will attempt diuresis as above
   -- cont lasix gtt.
   -- goal net -1L to 1.5L today
    # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Creatinine was initially trending down but  now continues
   to rise
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- follow lytes
    # Chronic Respiratory Acidosis/Compensatory Metablic Alkalosis/Acute
   Metabolic Acidosis
was on CVVH now off, holding on HD for now. Will
   try to diurese today as above
   # Hypernatremia:  likely in setting of diuresis.  Plan is to continue
   diuresis and add 1L free water via PEG for correction of hypernatremia.
   # DM:  not on insulin at home.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). 

The patient continues to require intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. The plan is to continue with diuresis for removal of total body overload. If the patient continues to improve, the plan is for possible extubation tomorrow. If not, the plan will be for tracheostomy on Monday. The husband, who is a healthcare professional, will make a decision by Monday.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated events (VAEs), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and hypernatremia.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, ABG results, fluid balance, renal function, electrolyte levels, and response to diuretics. Regular assessment of respiratory status, including daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), should be performed. Cultures of blood, sputum, urine, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be followed. The patient's glucose levels should be monitored due to her diabetes mellitus (DM) and insulin therapy.

Given the patient's renal failure, caution should be exercised when correcting her hypernatremia and repleting electrolytes. The patient's nutrition should be managed with a renal diet and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Prophylaxis measures should be continued, including stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, and VAP prophylaxis with head of bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up calls, and respiratory system batch interface (RSBI) assessments."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old woman with obesity hypoventilation, renal failure, and
   persistent fever. CT yesterday with two possible sources, some
   consolidation on L as well as atelectasis and sig. mucous
   in airways. No endobronchial lesions noted on bronch [**1-30**]. Also
   possible colonic thickening so will add flagyl and check c. diff again.
   On vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro which we will continue for a total 10 day course.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old woman with obesity hypoventilation, renal failure, and
   persistent fever. CT yesterday with two possible sources, some
   consolidation on L as well as atelectasis and sig. mucous
   in airways. No endobronchial lesions noted on bronch [**1-30**]. Also
   possible colonic thickening so will add flagyl and check c. diff again.
   On vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro which we will continue for a total 10 day course.
   Failing SBT's , we have been diuresing but LOS fluid balance is
   actually negative,  BUN/Cr are both elevated and she has hypernatremia.
   Some wheezes today-we will maximize bronchodilators and consider a
   short course of steroids if not improving.   Will discuss possibility
   of trach with husband. Further plans as per resident note.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis,
   and volume overload requiring CVVH.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   the setting of likely pneumonia.  She continues with the need for
   intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic
   respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.   However,
   metabolic acidosis has improved over the past 24 hours.  Diuresis for
   removal of total body overload. Pt failed SBT over past several days,
   considering Tracheostomy on Monday.  Husband, who is HCP was called and
   will make a decision by Monday.
   -- cover for VAP with vanco/meropenem/cipro/fluconazole
   -- SBT- not tolerated again this morning, continue daily
   -- continue combivent MDIs q6h
   -- cont lasix gtt with goal -1L

   # Ventilator Associated PNA
 Pt has previously completed a course of
   Vanc/Zosyn for PNA. Developed new infiltrates and fever now on
   Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro for planned 10 day course. Start Date [**2-5**]. Also
   on fluconazole for persistent +yeast cultures from sputum and multiple
   RF for fungal infection
   .
   # Fever
 Pt with multiple possible sources of fever including VAP,
   drug fever, pan-scan yesterday showing possible colonic thickening with
   question of early c.diff. C.diff neg X2
   -          resend C.diff, f/u culture data
   -          await final read CT scan torso and sinuses
   -          treat VAP as above
   .
   # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Creatinine was initially trending down but  now continues
   to rise
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- follow lytes
   - Pt may need HD, no urgent indication, renal following
   .
    # Volume Overload. Likely in setting of IVF resuscitation over the
   last few weeks in the ICU.  Pt is currently neg even for LOS. Will
   continue diuretics for goal even in setting of significant INs

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and now transferred with acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), fever, acute renal failure, and volume overload. The patient is currently intubated due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, lasix, and other ICU medications. She has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamides), pentothal, codeine, and wellbutrin. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on February 11th, 2023, at 12:46 AM. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute kidney injury (AKI), hyperkalemia, electrolyte imbalances, and infection control issues such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's ongoing management includes monitoring ABG, daily spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), tracheostomy consideration, and continuation of diuretics for fluid removal."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now with ARF, continued fevers despite broad spectrum
   coverage.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  Patient has now been intubated for > 2weeks and plan is for
   likely tracheostomy tomorrow.  CT [**Doctor First Name **] has been consulted as patient is
   morbidly obese and will require surgical tracheostomy.   She is
   currently on Vanco/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro for presumed PNA.  However, sputum
   cultures, BAL, blood cultures have remained negative for MRSA or gram
   organisms.  Sputum and Urine cultures have grown Yeast so Fluconazole
   was started last week.
   -- cover for VAP with vanco/meropenem/cipro/fluconazole
   -- SBT- not tolerated again this morning, continue daily
   -- continue combivent MDIs q6h

   # Ventilator Associated PNA
 Pt has previously completed a course of
   Vanc/Zosyn for PNA. Developed new infiltrates and fever now on
   Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro for planned 10 day course. Start Date [**2-5**]. Also
   on fluconazole for persistent +yeast cultures from sputum and multiple
   RF for fungal infection.  CT chest shows multiple pulmonary nodules in
   right lung along with left lingular consolidation
   -- cont abx as above
   -- send glucan, galactogamman for ?Aspergillus
   # Fever
 Pt with multiple possible sources of fever including VAP,
   drug fever with drug fevers seeming more likely at this point.  CT scan
   done over the weekend shows possible colonic thickening with question
   of early c.diff. C.diff neg X2.  ?Aspergillus given nodules in lung.
   -    f/u third C.diff for ?c.diff

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, and presumed pneumonia. The patient has been intubated for over 2 weeks and is planned for a tracheostomy tomorrow. She is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and fluconazole.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for pneumonia, but developed new infiltrates and fever. She is now on a new course of antibiotics to cover for VAP.
2. Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT): This is a possible complication of prolonged intubation. The patient's symptoms such as fever and increased secretions may indicate VAT.
3. Aspergillus infection: The presence of multiple pulmonary nodules raises the suspicion of an aspergillus infection. Further testing, such as glucan and galactomannan, is required to confirm this.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has a history of antibiotic use, which increases the risk of C. difficile infection. A negative test result has been obtained so far, but follow-up testing is needed.
5. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She was initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. Currently, she is being treated for acute renal failure, acidosis, and volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of likely pneumonia. She continues to require intubation due to relative metabolic acidosis in the setting of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. However, metabolic acidosis has improved over the past 24 hours. Diuresis for removal of total body overload is also being pursued.

The patient has previously completed a course of vancomycin and meropenem for pneumonia. She developed new infiltrates and fever, so she is now on vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin for a planned 10-day course. Additionally, she is on fluconazole for persistent yeast cultures from sputum and multiple risk factors for fungal infection.

The patient's fever may be due to various causes, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), drug fever, or pancreatitis. A recent CT scan showed possible colonic thickening with a question of early Clostridium difficile infection. However, C. difficile is currently negative. The patient's temperature should be monitored, and further investigations"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation, renal failure off CVVH, and persistent fever not associated with sepsis. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to multiple etiologies, including obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The respiratory support is currently being weaned off, but careful monitoring is required.

2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance, specifically hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further complications.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Renal function needs to be closely monitored, and the need for dialysis should be evaluated.

4. Infection: The patient has persistent fever, and there are concerns about possible infections such as fungal infection, Clostridium difficile (CDiff), drug fever, or atypical fungal infection. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be continued, and further investigations like cultures and imaging studies are needed to identify the source of infection.

5. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to septic shock or other causes. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

6. Hyperthermia: The patient's persistent fever needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications related to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old obese woman with multiple health issues. She is currently in the ICU due to various complications including fever, respiratory failure, renal failure, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient's fever has persisted over the weekend, and she is experiencing an electrolyte and fluid disorder. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not associated with ARDS, and acute renal failure. The patient's blood pressure is low, and her potassium levels are high.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and positive yeast in urine indicate a possible infection. Fungal infection is suspected, and appropriate antifungal medications are being administered.

2. Drug Fever: The patient has a high eosinophil count, which may suggest a drug fever. The ID consult will help determine if any medications are causing this reaction.

3. Atypical Fungal Infection: The patient's CT scan shows ground-glass opacities (GGO) and nodules in the lungs, which could indicate an atypical fungal infection.

4. Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome: The patient's obesity and hypoventilation may contribute to her respiratory failure.

5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal failure. The need for dialysis will be assessed based on the patient's condition.

6. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to multiple"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease stage 3.

The patient was admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. She required mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Upon admission, her vital signs were unstable with a heart rate between 110-160 beats per minute (SVT), blood pressure in the 80s, and fever with a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal with high potassium and low magnesium.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and fever. She has been receiving appropriate treatment including antibiotics, fluids, and renal replacement therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of renal function.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and ongoing management in the ICU. Regular reassessment of her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is essential to guide further interventions and optimize her outcomes."

   coverage.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  Patient has now been intubated for > 2weeks and plan is for
   likely tracheostomy tomorrow.  CT [**Doctor First Name **] has been consulted as patient is
   morbidly obese and will require surgical tracheostomy.   She is
   currently on Vanco/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro for presumed PNA.  However, sputum
   cultures, BAL, blood cultures have remained negative for MRSA or gram
   organisms.  Sputum and Urine cultures have grown Yeast so Fluconazole
   was started last week.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. She now presents with acute renal failure, continued fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and potential medical complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and fungal infection.

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of multi-drug resistant organisms, further deterioration of renal function, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and fungal infection.

It is important to continue aggressive treatment for VAP, including appropriate antibiotic therapy and consideration for tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is crucial due to the patient's acute renal failure and ongoing diuresis. The patient's glycemic control should be managed with insulin therapy, considering her history of diabetes mellitus.

Given the patient's risk factors, such as prolonged immobilization and central venous catheters, there is an increased risk of DVT and subsequent pulmonary embolism. Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy, such as low molecular weight heparin, should be considered to prevent thromboembolic events.

The patient's nutritional status should be assessed,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient now presents with acute renal failure, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, persistent fevers, and multiple pulmonary nodules on CT chest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for more than 2 weeks and requires a tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation due to persistent respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Despite completing a course of antibiotics, the patient developed new infiltrates and fever, suggesting VAP. The patient is being treated with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro and will continue on fluconazole for persistent yeast cultures from sputum.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension. Her creatinine levels are trending down, indicating some improvement.
4. Volume overload: The patient has evidence of volume overload, which has been managed with diuresis. Care will be taken to monitor fluid balance.
5. Chronic respiratory acidosis: The patient has chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation, as seen on ABG analysis.
6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient is not on insulin at home, so insulin therapy will be continued to manage her glycemic control.
7. Fungal infection: The"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation, renal failure off CVVH, and persistent fever not associated with sepsis. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to multiple etiologies. Continuous monitoring and weaning off mechanical ventilation should be done cautiously.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. Dialysis may be required to manage the renal failure.

3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). Close monitoring and correction of electrolytes are necessary.

4. Infection: The patient has a persistent fever and is at risk for various infections, including fungal infections, c-difficile, and drug fever. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and surveillance cultures should be conducted to identify and treat any infections.

5. Cardiac issues: The patient's cardiovascular system may be compromised due to obesity hypoventilation and the use of vasoactive medications. Monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and hemodynamics is crucial.

6. Nutritional concerns: The patient requires nutritional support due to her critical condition and impaired ability to eat. A nutrition plan, such as enteral feeding, should be implemented.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation, renal failure, and persistent fever. She has been off CVVH and all antibiotics except for fluconazole. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa, diarrhea, anal pain, codeine, and confusion/delirium. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 95%. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 141/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's labs show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, Cr, and glucose, along with low levels of albumin and potassium. She also has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated LDH, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's assessment includes fever, electrolyte and fluid disorder, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and possible atypical fungal infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory compromise. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function. This"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. She is in the ICU due to respiratory failure, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and persistent fever. The patient has a history of obesity hypoventilation, and her respiratory failure is attributed to multiple etiologies. She has been taking various antibiotics, but they were discontinued except for fluconazole due to concerns of drug fever. The patient's renal function is improving, but she still requires careful monitoring and potassium replacement. The patient is expected to undergo a surgical tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if her hypoventilation worsens or if there are further complications such as pneumonia or atypical fungal infection.
2. Renal Failure: Although the patient's creatinine levels are decreasing, there is still a risk of further deterioration in renal function. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte balance is necessary.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels require careful management, including replacement and close monitoring of potassium levels.
4. Persistent Fever: Despite discontinuing all antibiotics except fluconazole, the patient's fever persists. This could indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying cause that needs to be investigated.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show fluctuations, indicating potential episodes of hypotension. Close monitoring and"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now with ARF, course c/b difficulty to wean and
   persistent fevers.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  Patient was  intubated for > 2weeks and [**Doctor First Name **] for
   tracheostomy/peg placement yesterday which went well.  Patient has been
   d/c
d from all antibiotics.  Sputum cultures, BAL, blood cultures have
   remained negative for MRSA or gram
 organisms.
   -- wean PS today to previous levels of 12 of PS and 5 of PEEP
   -- continue combivent MDIs q6h
   # Ventilator Associated PNA
 Pt has previously completed a course of
   Vanc/Zosyn for PNA. Developed new infiltrates and fever and was
   transitioned to Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro. ID felt that her persistent
   fevers were likely secondary to drug fever and these medications were
   all d/c
d [**2-11**].  Fluconazole has also been discontinued.  CT chest shows
   multiple pulmonary nodules in right lung along with left lingular
   consolidation.  She should have a repeat CT Chest to look for
   resolution of her pulmonary nodules.
   -- cont to monitor
   # Fever
  AT this point, most likely [**2-11**] drug fever as patient has
   remained with a normal WBC count and cultures have remained negative.
   Antiobiotics have been discontinued as above.  Rash is now extending
   from her back towards her abdomen,  If rash continues to spread then
   will consider derm consult.
   -- monitor rash
   # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Cr stable at 6.5 today and she has excellent Urine
   Output.  Renal has been following and have now removed her HD
   catheter.
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- follow lytes
    # Volume Overload. Has been diuresed well over the weekend.
   However,   has had [**Last Name (un) 3228**] hypotensive episodes over the past two days
   responsive to fluids which argues for intravascular volume depletion.
   Plan is to hold lasix for now with a goal of even today.
   -- hold lasix
   -- goal even
   -- IVF boluses PRN
    # Chronic Respiratory Acidosis/Compensatory Metablic Alkalosis/Acute
   Metabolic Acidosis
 AG gap has elevated again today. Which is likely
   in setting of renal failure.  Will check lactate to rule out lactic
   acidosis.
   -- monitor lytes
   -- check lactate
    # DM:  not on insulin at home.
   -- cont insulin SS
    # FEN: Restart TF this afternoon. Replete lytes with caution given
   renal failure
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: restart tube feeds this afternoon.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. She now has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and peg placement yesterday, which went well. She has completed courses of various antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fever, but cultures have remained negative. The patient's recent CT chest showed multiple pulmonary nodules in the right lung along with left lingular consolidation. She will have a repeat CT chest to look for resolution of her pulmonary nodules. The patient's renal function has improved, and her urine output is excellent. Her Cr level is stable at 6.5 today. She has had hypotensive episodes over the past two days responsive to fluids, indicating intravascular volume depletion. Lasix will be held, and IVF boluses will be given as needed. The patient has an elevated AG gap today, which is likely in the setting of renal failure. Lactate levels will be checked to rule out lactic acidosis. The patient is not on insulin at home and will continue insulin SS. TF will be restarted this afternoon, and lytes will be repleted with caution given renal failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted for hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, as well as hypotension. The patient now presents with acute renal failure, respiratory failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and fever. 

The patient has been on multiple antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but these have been discontinued due to negative cultures. The patient continues to have persistent fevers, and fluconazole has been continued for positive yeast cultures from sputum. A CT scan shows multiple pulmonary nodules in the right lung and left lingular consolidation, with pending tests for Aspergillus infection.

The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. The creatinine level is trending down to 6.4, and it is unlikely that the patient will require dialysis at this time.

There is a mention of volume overload, which has been managed with diuresis over the weekend. The patient had a brief episode of hypotension yesterday that responded to fluid administration.

The patient's ABG results have improved with diuresis, indicating that she may be returning to her baseline with chronic respiratory acidosis and metabolic compensation.

Other assessments and plans include ongoing management of diabetes mellitus, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein throm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old obese woman with multiple health complications, including obesity hypoventilation syndrome, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and persistent fever. She is currently in the ICU and has undergone several procedures such as dialysis catheter insertion, percutaneous tracheostomy, and PEG insertion. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is sedated and unable to provide a medical history. She has a history of allergies to sulfa, codeine, and an unknown medication. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for diarrhea. 

24-hour events include the insertion of a dialysis catheter, PEG insertion, and percutaneous tracheostomy. The patient received fluids overnight due to low blood pressure and responded well. She remains afebrile. Allergies, code status, and disposition remain unchanged.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and receiving supplemental oxygen. Her blood pressure is low, but responding to fluids. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is good.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Other lab values indicate"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with obesity who is critically ill. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently undergoing various interventions. The patient has a history of hypoventilation, renal failure, and persistent fever not associated with sepsis. The fever is likely related to drug fever, as evidenced by the development of a rash and eosinophils on Zosyn/Meropenem. The patient is off all antibiotics except for fluconazole, which is being given for yeast in the sputum and urine.

The patient has undergone several procedures, including dialysis catheter placement, PEG insertion, and percutaneous tracheostomy. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 31 cmH2O. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 80s and heart rate in the 80s. She is receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and has an arterial line and multi-lumen line in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Imaging reveals left lower lobe atelectasis. The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance are also noted to be disordered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. She now presents with acute renal failure, persistent fevers, and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with a maculopapular rash that has been spreading, raising concerns for a drug rash. She has undergone a tracheostomy and peg placement, completed courses of various antibiotics, and had cultures remain negative. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, and she has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Her metabolic acidosis has normalized, and she is currently experiencing volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Drug Rash: The patient's maculopapular rash, which has been spreading from her back to her entire body, raises concerns for a drug rash. This could be a potential complication of one or more medications she has been receiving. A dermatology consult has been ordered for further evaluation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has previously completed a course of antibiotics for VAP but developed new infiltrates and fever. She was transitioned to another combination of antibiotics, which have also been discontinued."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She was initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient now presents with acute renal failure, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, and persistent fevers. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure secondary to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), fever, acute renal failure (ATN), volume overload, chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, acute metabolic acidosis, diabetes mellitus (not on insulin at home), and feeding intolerance.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening respiratory failure leading to further hypoxemia and hypercapnia, development of septic shock due to persistent infection, progression of acute renal failure to chronic renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, and glycemic control issues. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels. Appropriate management strategies should be implemented to address each of the patient's current conditions and prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now with ARF, course c/b difficulty to wean and
   persistent fevers.
   # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  Patient was  intubated for > 2weeks and [**Doctor First Name **] for
   tracheostomy/peg placement yesterday which went well.  Patient has been
   d/c
d from all antibiotics.  Sputum cultures, BAL, blood cultures have
   remained negative for MRSA or gram
 organisms.
   -- wean PS today to previous levels of 12 of PS and 5 of PEEP
   -- continue combivent MDIs q6h
   # Ventilator Associated PNA
 Pt has previously completed a course of
   Vanc/Zosyn for PNA. Developed new infiltrates and fever and was
   transitioned to Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro. ID felt that her persistent
   fevers were likely secondary to drug fever and these medications were
   all d/c
d [**2-11**].  Fluconazole has also been discontinued.  CT chest shows
   multiple pulmonary nodules in right lung along with left lingular
   consolidation.  She should have a repeat CT Chest to look for
   resolution of her pulmonary nodules.
   -- cont to monitor
   # Fever
  AT this point, most likely [**2-11**] drug fever as patient has
   remained with a normal WBC count and cultures have remained negative.
   Antiobiotics have been discontinued as above.  Rash is now extending
   from her back towards her abdomen,  If rash continues to spread then
   will consider derm consult.
   -- monitor rash
   # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Cr stable at 6.5 today and she has excellent Urine
   Output.  Renal has been following and have now removed her HD
   catheter.
   -- appreciate renal involvement
   -- follow lytes
    # Volume Overload. Has been diuresed well over the weekend.
   However,   has had [**Last Name (un) 3228**] hypotensive episodes over the past two days
   responsive to fluids which argues for intravascular volume depletion.
   Plan is to hold lasix for now with a goal of even today.
   -- hold lasix
   -- goal even
   -- IVF boluses PRN
    # Chronic Respiratory Acidosis/Compensatory Metablic Alkalosis/Acute
   Metabolic Acidosis
 AG gap has elevated again today. Which is likely
   in setting of renal failure.  Will check lactate to rule out lactic
   acidosis.
   -- monitor lytes
   -- check lactate
    # DM:  not on insulin at home.
   -- cont insulin SS
    # FEN: Restart TF this afternoon. Replete lytes with caution given

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She was initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, as well as hypotension. Currently, she is experiencing acute renal failure, fever, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), volume overload, chronic respiratory acidosis, and compensatory metabolic alkalosis with an acute metabolic acidosis.

The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, for which she was intubated for over two weeks. A tracheostomy/PEG placement was performed yesterday, which went well. She has been disconnected from all antibiotics, and sputum cultures, BAL, and blood cultures have remained negative for MRSA or gram-positive organisms.

The patient has completed a course of Vanc/Zosyn for PNA but developed new infiltrates and fever. She was then transitioned to Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro. However, these medications were discontinued on 2/11 due to suspected drug fever. Fluconazole has also been discontinued. A CT chest shows multiple pulmonary nodules in the right lung along with left lingular consolidation. She should have a repeat CT chest to look for resolution of her pulmonary nodules.

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation, renal failure off CVVH, and persistent fever not associated with sepsis. She has a worsening rash and eosinophils, suggesting a drug-related fever. All antibiotics have been stopped. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. Her vital signs include a temperature of 102.5°F, blood pressure of 127/55 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 570 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 29 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as low albumin and hemoglobin levels. The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance is also abnormal. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa, pentothal, codeine, and Wellbutrin. She has experienced diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, confusion, and delirium in the past. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on February 11th. The patient's family has been informed and agrees with the plan to move forward with a percutaneous central catheter placement"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation, renal failure, and persistent fever not associated with sepsis. The patient has a worsening rash and eosinophils, suggesting a drug fever. All antibiotics have been discontinued.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: Despite the discontinuation of antibiotics, the patient still has a fever. This could indicate an ongoing or new infection that needs to be further investigated and managed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating possible hypotension. This may require adjustment of fluids and vasopressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium in the blood, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. It is important to monitor potassium levels and take appropriate measures to manage hyperkalemia.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is ongoing weaning of PS (positive end-expiratory pressure). Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and continued weaning process will be necessary to avoid respiratory failure.

5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a need for close monitoring of renal function. Replacement of potassium and following the levels are recommended.

6. Eosinophilia: The presence of eosinophils in the blood can indicate an allergic reaction or drug-induced eosinophilia. Further investigation"

   persistent fevers.
   # Rash:  Patient has had a maculopapular, blanching, coalescing rash
   for one week.  Rash has spread from her back to her entire body.
   Concern is for drug rash given appearance of rash along with continued
   fevers.  Dermatology has been consulted for evaluation.

   multiple pulmonary nodules in right lung along with left lingular
   consolidation.  She should have a repeat CT Chest to look for
   resolution of her pulmonary nodules.
   -- cont to monitor
    # Fever
  At this point, most likely [**2-11**] drug fever as patient has
   remained with a normal WBC count and cultures have remained negative.
   Antiobiotics have been discontinued as above.  Rash is now extending
   from her back towards her abdomen,  If rash continues to spread then
   will consider derm consult.
   -- monitor rash
   # Acute renal failure. likely due to ATN in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension. Cr stable at 6.2 today and she has excellent Urine
   Output.  Renal has been following and have now removed her HD

The patient's chief complaint is fever, which has been present intermittently since admission. The patient also has a rash, diagnosed as a drug hypersensitivity rash. He has a known allergy to sulfa medications, codeine, and pentothal. The patient has been febrile overnight and has not had a PICC line placed due to the PICC RN refusing. The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient is receiving various medications and infusions, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,120 mL and output of 1,835 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 285 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and is receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient's respiratory support parameters are within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results indicate several abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes.

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted for hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. She now presents with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and fever. The patient has been experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator and persistent fevers. She has a maculopapular, blanching, coalescing rash for one week, which has spread from her back to her entire body. Dermatology has been consulted for evaluation. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, and she has been intubated for over two weeks.

The patient's ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been treated with various antibiotics, but she developed new infiltrates and fever. These symptoms may be indicative of a drug fever.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation, renal failure off CVVH, and persistent fever not associated with sepsis. She has a worsening rash and eosinophils, with all antibiotics discontinued. The patient's temperature is 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure is 95/39 mmHg, heart rate is 85 bpm, respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 100. The patient's physical examination reveals a warm skin with a rash over the face and trunk, fluctuating neurologic status, and right and left lower extremities with 2+ edema. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 28600 cells/mm3, elevated creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance is also noted. Imaging shows a stable chest X-ray. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's persistent fever could be due to drug fever, new ICU infection, or sinusitis. Further investigation is required to determine the underlying cause.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She was initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient now presents with acute renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a maculopapular rash covering her entire body. The rash has been stable, and she has been off all antibiotics. Her sputum cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and blood cultures have remained negative for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or gram-positive organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for PNA but developed new infiltrates and fever. She was transitioned to Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro, but these medications were discontinued on [**2-11**]. A repeat CT chest is recommended to look for resolution of her pulmonary nodules.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Her serum creatinine level is stable at 5.2 today, and she has excellent urine output. Renal involvement is being followed, and she will be monitored for electrolyte imbalances.
3. Volume overload: The patient is slightly overloaded but will not be diuresed today due to the presence of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. She now presents with acute renal failure, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, and persistent fevers. The patient has developed a maculopapular rash that has spread from her back to her entire body, and there is concern for a drug rash given the appearance of the rash along with continued fevers. Dermatology has been consulted for evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has previously completed a course of antibiotics for PNA but developed new infiltrates and fever, indicating a possible recurrence of VAP. A repeat CT chest is recommended to look for resolution of pulmonary nodules.
2. Drug fever: The patient's persistent fevers may be secondary to drug fever, especially since cultures have remained negative. Discontinuation of antibiotics and monitoring the rash are appropriate.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is necessary.
4. Volume overload: The patient is slightly overloaded but will not be diuresed today due to the presence of a rash and fevers.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has acute metabolic acidosis, which has normalized. Continued"

   initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hypotension, now with ARF, course c/b difficulty to wean and
   persistent fevers.
   # Rash:  Patient has had a maculopapular, blanching, coalescing rash
   for one week.  Rash has spread from her back to her entire body.
   Concern is for drug rash given appearance of rash along with continued
   fevers.  Dermatology has been consulted for evaluation.

   - Haldol PRN for agitation
   - Sarna lotion
   - Start Triamcinolone 0.1% lotion
    # Respiratory failure.  Secondary to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  Patient was  intubated for > 2weeks and went for
   tracheostomy/peg placement on [**2-12**] which went well.  Patient has been
   d/c

 Pt has previously completed a course of
   Vanc/Zosyn for PNA. Developed new infiltrates and fever and was
   transitioned to Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro. ID felt that her persistent
   fevers were likely secondary to drug fever and these medications were
   all d/c

   multiple pulmonary nodules in right lung along with left lingular
   consolidation.  She should have a repeat CT Chest to look for
   resolution of her pulmonary nodules.

    # Fever
  At this point, most likely [**2-11**] drug fever as patient has
   remained with a normal WBC count and cultures have remained negative.
   Antiobiotics have been discontinued as above.  Rash is now extending

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient now presents with acute renal failure, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, persistent fevers, and a maculopapular rash that has spread from her back to her entire body.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for more than 2 weeks and developed new infiltrates and fever, indicating a possible VAP.
2. Drug rash: The patient's maculopapular rash could be a drug reaction, especially considering the recent discontinuation of antibiotics and other medications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure due to ATN in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is necessary.
4. Volume overload: The patient is slightly overloaded but will not be diuresed today due to the presence of a rash and fevers.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has acute metabolic acidosis that needs to be closely monitored, along with electrolyte levels.

Please note that these are potential medical complications based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by healthcare professionals are required for an accurate diagnosis and management plan."

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. She now presents with acute renal failure, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, persistent fevers, and a maculopapular rash that has been spreading for one week.

The patient's respiratory status is stable with controlled oxygenation and ventilation. However, she is still dependent on the ventilator and has had difficulty weaning. The tracheostomy tube is twisted, with the tip abutting the right posterolateral wall of the trachea. No pneumothorax is present.

The patient has had multiple courses of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has completed a course of Vancomycin (Vanc) and Zosyn. However, she developed new infiltrates and fever, leading to the transition to Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro. These medications were later discontinued due to suspected drug fever.

A CT chest shows multiple pulmonary nodules in the right lung along with left lingular consolidation. Repeat CT chest is recommended to monitor for resolution of the pulmonary nodules. The patient's recent sputum culture and blood cultures have remained negative for MRSA or gram-positive organisms.

The patient also has a maculopapular, blanching, coalescing rash that has spread from her back to her entire body. This rash has been present for one"

They also have hypertension (high blood pressure), with a reading of 147/48 mmHg, and tachycardia (elevated heart rate) with a range of 79-108 bpm.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning as well. They are receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation through a tracheostomy tube, indicating respiratory failure. The PaO2/FiO2 (PF) ratio is mentioned as 59, which suggests significant hypoxemia. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.27, indicating respiratory acidosis.

The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by an elevated serum creatinine level of 6.4 mg/dL and BUN level of 148 mg/dL. Additionally, the patient has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.1 mEq/L.

The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance is also disrupted, with imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels. The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, with a total input of 4,200 mL over the past 24 hours.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old obese woman with a history of obesity hypoventilation, improving renal failure, and persistent fever not associated with sepsis. She has a drug-induced rash with eosinophilia and is currently off antibiotics (ABX). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F (38.8°C), blood pressure ranging from 128/46-147/101 mmHg, heart rate between 79-108 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. Her current medications include haloperidol, heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever, which may indicate an underlying infection or drug reaction. Further investigation is required to identify the cause and determine appropriate treatment.
2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, as evidenced by abnormal laboratory values such as high potassium levels (Hyperkalemia) and altered renal function. Close monitoring and management of fluid and electrolyte balance are necessary.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Weaning off ventilator support should be continued, aiming for decreased dependence on mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Continued monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are crucial.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which may be related to fluid and electrolyte imbalances or cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
6. Drug Reaction: The patient's rash and eosinophilia suggest a possible drug-induced reaction. Discontinuation of potential offending medications and monitoring for further signs or symptoms of drug reactions are important.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. Immediate treatment is required to address this electrolyte imbalance.
8. Nutritional Support: Given the patient's obesity and prolonged ICU stay, nutritional support should be optimized to promote healing and recovery.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition."

","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation, renal failure off CVVH, and persistent fever not associated with sepsis. She has a worsening rash and eosinophils, and all antibiotics have been discontinued. The fever could be due to drug fever, a new ICU infection, or sinusitis. It is recommended to consult dermatology, call ENT to drain sinus, discontinue central line, and check PICC line placement.

The patient also has agitation, and sedation should be decreased. Seroquel and haldol can be used for agitation management. Vent weaning should continue, and renal function should be monitored with a decreasing creatinine level. Sodium level of 149 should be addressed by adding free water.

Nutrition is being provided through Nutren Renal (Full) at 35 mL/hour. The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prophylaxis is also in place.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition remains in the ICU. The attending physician spent a total of 45 minutes with the patient."

   multiple pulmonary nodules in right lung along with left lingular
   consolidation.  She should have a repeat CT Chest to look for
   resolution of her pulmonary nodules.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She was initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient now presents with acute renal failure, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, persistent fevers, and a maculopapular rash that has spread from her back to her entire body. The rash is suspected to be drug-related. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but cultures have remained negative. She has undergone a tracheostomy and peg placement and is currently on a tracheal mask. The patient's condition has improved, and she is being transferred to rehab today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, along with difficulty weaning from the ventilator, suggests the possibility of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate acute renal failure. This may be secondary to sepsis and hypotension.
3. Drug Rash: The patient's maculopapular rash, which has spread to her entire body, is suspected to be drug-related. It is important to monitor the rash and follow dermatology recommendations.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Despite completing a course of antibiotics, the patient developed new infiltrates"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She was initially admitted with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. Currently, she is experiencing acute respiratory failure, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, persistent fevers, and a maculopapular rash that has spread from her back to her entire body. The patient's condition is complicated by chronic respiratory acidosis, compensatory metabolic alkalosis, and acute metabolic acidosis. She also has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. The patient's recent medical interventions include tracheostomy and peg placement, discontinuation of all antibiotics, and removal of her hemodialysis catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed new infiltrates and fever despite being on different courses of antibiotics, indicating a possible VAP.
2. Drug fever: The persistent fevers could be secondary to drug fever, as the patient's white blood cell count remains normal and cultures have remained negative.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, which is likely due to ATN in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.
4. Volume overload: The patient is currently slightly overloaded but will not be diuresed today due to the presence of a rash and fevers.

","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure from pneumonia, obesity hypoventilation, improving renal failure, drug rash, and fever with eosinophilia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period and has undergone tracheostomy placement. She is also receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has had all antibiotics discontinued. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 119/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs with no wheezes, warm skin with a rash over the face and trunk, fluctuating neurologic status, and peripheral edema in both lower extremities. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased blood urea nitrogen, elevated creatinine, elevated potassium, and decreased total CO2. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, abnormal kidney function tests, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with some readings being high and others within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include fever, electrolyte and fluid disorder, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and drug rash with fever and eosinophilia. The patient is expected to be transferred to rehabilitation today"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of respiratory failure from pneumonia, obesity hypoventilation, improving renal failure, drug rash, and fever with eosinophilia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy and has been weaned off continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Her blood pressure is relatively stable, but she experiences episodes of agitation that require haloperidol. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). She has been improving overall, with decreasing creatinine levels and resolution of the drug rash/fever. The patient has been discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy, which helps support her breathing. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilator-associated events if proper infection control measures are not followed.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. It is important to monitor her renal function closely and manage any complications such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of potassium levels and appropriate management to normalize them is essential"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation, improving renal failure off CVVH, and persistent fever not associated with sepsis. She has a drug-related fever with worsening rash and eosinophilia. All antibiotics have been discontinued. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/45-171/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, warm extremities with right 2+ edema, and a rash over the face and trunk that is worse on the arms. Neurologically, the patient is fluctuating and receiving sedation as needed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 6.2-6.5 mg/dL, and potassium levels ranging from 4.5-5.2 mEq/L. Other lab values include a glucose level of 105-187 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation due to respiratory failure,"
