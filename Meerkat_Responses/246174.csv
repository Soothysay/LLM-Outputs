   4) Lung cancer
   5) Fever
   Respiratory symptoms and oxygenation improved with diuretic. CXR shows
   some patchy infiltrates in the right lung consistent with possible
   alveolar leak, perhaps secondary to transfusion related acute lung
   injury and/or volume overload. Patient doing better and tolerating
   lower FIO2. Pulmonary embolism less likely. Patient now on 3L O2 via
   nasal cannula with O2 sat 94%.
   Hct in appropriate range post transfusion.
   Patient on antibiotics for fever. No clear source. Awaiting cultures.
   Fluids even to slightly negative today. BUN/Creat mildly elevated.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 54 year-old female with a history of NSCLC,
   post-obstructive pneumonia, history of PE who presents with hypoxia in
   setting of blood transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure - PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 147-200 assuming FiO2 of
   50-70% on NRB.  Main consideration is TRALI, other consideration is
   volume overload but patient didn't respond to furosemide.  PE unlikely
   given on therapeutic enoxaparin but can consider working up if
   tachycardia/hypoxia persist.  Exacerbation of post-osbtructive
   pneuomonia also possiblity. Pt doing well this AM, much improved after
   measured diuresis
   - Continue enoxaparin therapeutic dose
   - Broaden antibiotics to Vancomycin/Pip-Tazo
   - Continue supplemental O2, and monitor O2 Sats
   - Sputum culture and narrow antibioitics as approriate
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), post-obstructive pneumonia, and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). She presents with hypoxia in the setting of blood transfusion. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius (101.2 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91/67 mmHg to 102/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 93%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (35.2 K/uL), hematocrit (26.6%), platelet count (601 K/uL), creatinine (0.8 mg/dL), glucose (243 mg/dL), and elevated levels of PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, magnesium, and phosphate.

The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, possibly due to transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), volume overload, or exacerbation of post-obstructive pneumonia. The treatment plan includes continuing enoxaparin at therapeutic dose, broadening antibiotics to Vancomycin/Pip-Tazo, providing supplemental oxygen, and monitoring oxygen saturation. S"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), post-obstructive pneumonia, and previous pulmonary embolism. She presented with hypoxia after receiving a blood transfusion. The patient's current vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased breath sounds in the left lung field. Her oxygen saturation is in the upper 90s on 6 liters of supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been febrile and tachycardic overnight, but denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. She reports feeling better this morning and has mild nausea with medications, which is relieved with food. Foley catheter was discontinued yesterday, and her urine output has been good.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. Blood cultures are pending, as well as pleural fluid analysis and cultures.

Chest X-ray reveals complete opacification of the left hemithorax due to a central obstructing mass with associated total collapse and effusion. The right lung shows some decrease in heterogeneous airspace opacity that rapidly developed two days ago.

Plan:

1. Respiratory failure - The main consideration is transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), with other possibilities including volume overload, exacerbation of post-obstructive pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism. The patient was tapped and sent for culture"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), post-obstructive pneumonia, and a previous pulmonary embolism (PE). She presented with hypoxia in the setting of a blood transfusion. She is currently intubated and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at 6 liters per minute. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 118 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is alert, awake, and pleasant, with decreased breath sounds in the left lung field and relatively clear right lung field posteriorly. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Imaging reveals complete opacification of the left hemithorax from a known central obstructing mass with associated total collapse and effusion, as well as decreased heterogeneous airspace opacity in the right lung.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio suggests respiratory failure. Possible causes include TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury), volume overload, exacerbation of post-obstructive pneumonia, or another underlying condition. The patient will need close monitoring and respiratory support as necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 54 year-old female with a history of NSCLC,
   post-obstructive pneumonia, history of PE who presents with hypoxia in
   setting of blood transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure - PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 147-200 assuming FiO2 of
   50-70% on NRB.  Main consideration is TRALI, other consideration is
   volume overload but patient didn't respond to furosemide.  PE unlikely
   given on therapeutic enoxaparin but can consider working up if
   tachycardia/hypoxia persist.  Exacerbation of post-osbtructive
   pneuomonia also possiblity. Pt doing well this AM, much improved after
   measured diuresis
   - Continue enoxaparin therapeutic dose
   - Broaden antibiotics to Vancomycin/Pip-Tazo
   - Continue supplemental O2, and monitor O2 Sats
   - Sputum culture and narrow antibioitics as approriate
   .
   # hyponatremia - present since past week.  Hypovolemia versus chronic
   pulmonary process related SIADH.  Monitor and hold off on aggressive
   fluids for now, given hypoxia.
   .
   # Fevers/leukocytosis - most likely secondary to PNA but C. difficile
   aslo possiblity given recent antibiotics and degree of leukocytosis.
   No history of diarrhea.

   # NSCLC
 f/u onc recs, if any.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN:  Regular diet, electrolyte sliding scale
   .
   # Access - Peripheral IVs, portacath
   .
   # PPx:  Enoxaparin therapeutic dose, PPI for GERD

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer), post-obstructive pneumonia, and a history of PE (pulmonary embolism). She presents with hypoxia during a blood transfusion. Her current condition includes respiratory failure, hyponatremia, fevers/leukocytosis, hypothyroidism, and potential complications related to her underlying conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury): Given the patient's hypoxia during a blood transfusion, there is a possibility of TRALI. This condition is characterized by acute respiratory distress and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema following transfusion.
2. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating possible volume overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory failure.
3. PE (pulmonary embolism): Although the patient is receiving therapeutic enoxaparin (a blood thinner), persistent tachycardia and hypoxia may raise concerns for a possible PE.
4. Exacerbation of post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient's history of post-obstructive pneumonia and current symptoms may indicate an exacerbation of this condition.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use and leukocytosis raise the possibility of a C. difficile infection.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a"

   Patient admitted to ICU with acute respiratory failure hypoxemic in
   nature and with pulmonary edema likely contributor and hydrostatic
   edema may be less likely at this time given current sinus tachycardia
   and fever.  She has continued fevers with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia leading to a picture of ongoing sepsis/infection.  The
   sources for this do include pulmonary parenchyma and pleural space but
   attempts to tap effusion in the past have not succeded.
   Exam
Patient alert, comfortable by sujective report.  She has
   persistent sinus tachycardia and fever.  Lung exam with absence of
   breath sounds in left side and with significant crackles in right lung
   in mid and lower lung fields
   Will
   1)Continue Vanco/Zosyn, follow up cultures, will have to reconsider
   imaging of left lung if concern for abscess is raised with limited
   response and hypdense regions seen previously do raise the possible

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has recurrence, right-sided pulmonary embolism (PE), and loculated left pleural effusion. She was admitted with fever due to presumed post-obstructive pneumonia and transferred to the ICU with worsening hypoxemia after a transfusion. The patient's condition has improved, and she reports feeling excellent this morning with no pain or lightheadedness, but she does report thirst.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), current temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate (HR) of 124 bpm (with a baseline of 88-128 bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 98/54 mmHg to 116/74 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute (with a baseline of 11-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97% on 5 L of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds on the right side and diminished breath sounds on the left side, as well as a soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient has no edema in her extremities, and her neurologic exam is not assessed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 54 year-old female with a history of NSCLC,
   post-obstructive pneumonia, history of PE who presents with hypoxia in
   setting of blood transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure - PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 147-200 assuming FiO2 of
   50-70% on NRB.  Main consideration is TRALI, other consideration is
   volume overload but patient didn't respond to furosemide.  PE unlikely
   given on therapeutic enoxaparin but can consider working up if
   tachycardia/hypoxia persist.  Exacerbation of post-obstructive
   pneuomonia also possiblity. Pt was tapped [**8-3**], with culture NGTD.
   - Continue enoxaparin therapeutic dose
   - Will d/c Vancomycin today. Continue Zosyn (?Day3), and transition to
   PO Augmentin prior to discharge home.
   - Consider changing to Meropenem for better GN coverage if clinically
   worsens
   - Continue supplemental O2, and monitor O2 Sats
   - Pt unable to produce sputum culture
   - Check a urine culture
   - Pt unable to wean down O2 thus far to home baseline of 2-3L. Pt may
   have new increased O2 requirement of 4-6L. Continue to wean as
   tolerated.
   - Attempt to walk pt today to monitor for desats
   - Continue Advair, Spiriva, Albuterol PRN
   .
   #Tachycardia- Initially thought to be secondary to hypovolemia. Now,
   elevated HR yesterday most likely related to fevers, as HR curve
   mirrors trend of fevers.  Pt appears to be euvolemic today.
   - Tylenol PRN fever, Ibuprofen if Tylenol does not break fever
   - Consider EKG to eval if persists, becomes symptomatic, to check for
   arrhythmia
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), post-obstructive pneumonia, and previous pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxia. Over the past 24 hours, the patient experienced fever spikes that did not respond to Tylenol but broke with Ibuprofen. Her oxygen saturation levels were weaned from 6L to 3L, but she desaturated to the upper 80s and was placed back on 6L, maintaining mid-90s saturation. The patient also passed a bowel movement this morning without gross blood, which was her first since admission. Blood cultures were obtained at 12:29 PM and 04:19 PM on 08-07-2184. An ultrasound was performed at 11:06 PM on 08-07-2184, showing no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities.

Allergies:
The patient has allergies to morphine and related medications, causing hives, and itching from Levaquin (levofloxacin). The last dose of antibiotics given was Vancomycin on 08-07-2184 at 08:30 PM and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 08-08-2184 at 04:05 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 54 year-old female with a history of NSCLC,
   post-obstructive pneumonia, history of PE who presents with hypoxia in
   setting of blood transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure - PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 147-200 assuming FiO2 of
   50-70% on NRB.  Main consideration is TRALI, other consideration is
   volume overload but patient didn't respond to furosemide.  PE unlikely
   given on therapeutic enoxaparin but can consider working up if
   tachycardia/hypoxia persist.  Exacerbation of post-obstructive
   pneuomonia also possiblity. Pt was tapped [**8-3**], with culture NGTD.
   - Continue enoxaparin therapeutic dose
   - Continue  Vancomycin/ Zosyn (Day 2
   - Consider changing to Meropenem for better GN coverage if clinically
   worsens
   - Continue supplemental O2, and monitor O2 Sats
   - Sputum culture and narrow antibioitics as appropriate
   - Will try to wean O2 as tolerated to home baseline requirement of
   2-3L.
   - Continue Advair, Spiriva, Albuterol PRN
   .
   #Tachycardia- Likely secondary to hypovolemia. Will try to improve HR
   with volume repletion.  Has also been persistently febrile today, so HR
   may be elevated secondary to increased metabolic demand. Pt has hx of
   PE. CXR this a.m. without tracheal shift. O2 requirement persists at 5L
   with sat in low 90s.
   - Continue fluid boluses
   - Tylenol PRN fever, Ibuprofen if Tylenol does not break fever
   - Consider EKG to eval if persists, becomes symptomatic, to check for
   arrhythmia
   .
   # hyponatremia - present since past week.  Hypovolemia versus chronic
   pulmonary process related SIADH.
   - Will continue fluid hydration today with NS boluses.
   - Re-check lytes in p.m.
   .
   # Fevers/leukocytosis - most likely secondary to PNA but C. difficile
   also possiblity given recent antibiotics and degree of leukocytosis.
   No history of diarrhea.
   - f/u pending blood culture
   - C.Diff, sputum, urine culture ordered. Pending collection.
   .
   # NSCLC
 f/u onc recs, if any.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   #Pain control- well-controlled. Dilaudid PRN, Oxycodone
   .
   # FEN:  Regular diet, electrolyte sliding scale
   .
   # Access - Peripheral IVs, portacath
   .
   # PPx:  Enoxaparin therapeutic dose, Ranitidine for GERD, bowel regimen
   (Docusate, Lactulose, Senna PRN), Insulin SS
   .
   # Code:  Full code; however, given the tenuous nature of pt
s pulmonary
   status, will discuss with pt and family regarding goals of care.
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU for now as HR still elevated to 130s.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with metastatic lung cancer and left lung collapse due to endobronchial occlusion, accompanied by a large left pleural effusion. She was admitted with persistent fever presumed secondary to post-obstructive pneumonia.
- The patient's hospital course was complicated by worsening hypoxemia after receiving transfusions. However, her hypoxemia has been relatively stable, and there doesn't appear to be anything reversible by exam or imaging. She may have reached a new baseline due to the progression of her lung cancer.
- She has a history of allergies to morphine and related medications, as well as levaquin (levofloxacin). She received piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin on August 8th.
- The patient is currently receiving various medications, including hydromorphone (Dilaudid), enoxaparin (Lovenox), ranitidine (prophylaxis), MVI, colace, spiriva, oxycodone, synthroid, advair, and RISS.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.
- Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate between 104-132 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 83/46 to 121/63 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-31 breaths per minute"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with metastatic lung cancer and a history of right pulmonary embolism (PE), left lung collapse, and large left pleural effusion. She was admitted with persistent fever presumed secondary to post-obstructive pneumonia. 

The patient has been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure and has shown stable oxygen saturation levels at 97% while on nasal cannula. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.25, which indicates respiratory acidosis. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate between 104-132 bpm, and her blood pressure is within normal limits at 65/59 mmHg. She has a fever of 102.0 F, which has improved with the use of ibuprofen. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles on the right base and absent breath sounds on the left side. Her neurological assessment is normal, with attentiveness and ability to follow simple commands. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 35.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 609 K/uL. Her blood glucose levels are elevated at 243 mg/dL and 203 mg/dL. The rest of her lab values are within normal limits.
