","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman who underwent a vaginal delivery and was admitted to the ICU with fevers, pyometrium, and retained products of conception. The patient's condition was complicated by significant vaginal bleeding and an atonic uterus.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has been receiving fluids and blood transfusions.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. There are also abnormalities in platelet count, coagulation factors, and electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures have been obtained, and she is receiving antibiotic coverage.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including shock (likely a combination of septic and hemorrhagic physiology), pyometrium/endometritis, uterine atony, and retained products of conception. The patient's bleeding has slowed significantly, and she continues to receive methergin for uterine atony management. The plan includes monitoring HCTs and DIC labs every 6 hours, transfusing as necessary for low hemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen, and high INR levels. Antibiotic coverage will be continued, and follow-up"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old female who recently gave birth vaginally and is experiencing fevers, pyometrium (pus-filled womb), retained products of conception, significant vaginal bleeding, and an atonic uterus. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 103.1°F, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, mild suprapubic tenderness, and warm skin. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated lactate, and prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic and hemorrhagic shock, which may be due to a combination of infection and blood loss.

2. Pyometrium/Endometritis: The patient has purulent drainage after a dilation and curettage procedure. Antibiotic coverage will be continued, and cultures will be followed up.

3. Uterine atony: The patient is experiencing ongoing bleeding due to an atonic uterus. Methergin will be continued to manage this condition.

4. Fluid and electrolyte balance: Fluid resuscitation has been initiated, and blood products have been administered. Monitoring"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill female with a chief complaint of septic and hypovolemic shock. The patient is experiencing lower abdominal and pelvic pain, as well as passing blood and clots through the vagina. The Hct remains at 20-21, indicating ongoing bleeding. The patient has received transfusions of blood products, and there has been an infusion of fluids to maintain euvolemia. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is receiving antibiotics for pyometrium. There is also a concern for DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), uterine atony, and preserved renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): DIC is a serious condition characterized by widespread activation of the clotting cascade, leading to the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. This can result in multiple organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock may worsen if the infection is not adequately controlled or if there is a resistance to the antibiotics being used.
3. Hypovolemic Shock: The ongoing bleeding and low Hct levels indicate hypovolemic shock. If the bleeding continues or if the patient does not receive adequate fluid resuscitation, this can lead to further deterioration in the patient's condition.
4. Uterine Atrophy: The patient's uterine atony (failure of the uterus to contract after childbirth)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 22-year-old female who presented with fevers, retained products of conception, and blood loss anemia after a postpartum hemorrhage. She was treated with broad antibiotic coverage, pitocin, and methylsergide for uterine atony and ongoing bleeding. The patient developed hypotension and was transferred to the ICU for management of mixed septic/hypovolemic shock.

On examination, the patient's temperature is 105.0°F, blood pressure is 92/55 mmHg, heart rate is 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. Her cardiovascular exam shows a hyperdynamic precordium, normal S1 and S2 sounds, and no murmurs or extra heart sounds. Her peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Her respiratory exam reveals clear breath sounds with no wheezing or crackles. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. There is no lower extremity edema or cyanosis.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 135 K/uL,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old female who presented with fevers, blood loss anemia, and retained products of conception following a recent postpartum delivery. She was treated with broad antibiotic coverage and pitocin for uterine atony and ongoing bleeding. The patient developed hypotension and was transferred to the ICU.

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate. Her vital signs at that time were as follows: temperature 105.0°F, blood pressure 92/55 mmHg, heart rate 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The physical examination revealed no jugular venous distention, flat cervix, regular heart rhythm, and soft bowel sounds.

The laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 10,000 cells/mm³, hematocrit (HCT) of 25%, potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L, international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.6, and fibrinogen level of 97 mg/dL.

The patient's condition is being managed with broad antibiotic coverage for pyometrium, including ampicillin, gentamicin,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female who underwent a vaginal delivery and is now experiencing fevers, pyometrium, and retained products of conception. The patient also had significant vaginal bleeding and an atonic uterus. She received a total of 6.5 liters of fluid and 3 units of blood. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 100% FiO2. The patient's blood pressure is in the 80s-90s, heart rate is around 84 beats per minute, and temperature is spiking to 104.6°F. She has a history of allergies to ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.2 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 33, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 62 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis. The combination of septic and hemorrhagic physiology may have led to shock, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old African American female who was admitted to the ICU following a vaginal delivery. She experienced fevers, pyometrium, and retained products of conception, which complicated by significant vaginal bleeding and uterine atony. The patient underwent a dilation and curettage procedure with bilateral uterine artery ligation. She received a total of 6.5 liters of fluid and 3 units of blood. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, and shock. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and being monitored closely for DIC. The plan includes continuing with antibiotic coverage, monitoring the trend in fever curve and white blood cell count, following obstetric recommendations, and considering a CT scan of the pelvis with contrast to rule out septic thrombophlebitis.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pyometrium/endometritis: The patient's retained products of conception and subsequent dilation and curettage procedure may increase the risk of developing pyometrium/endometritis. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for this infection.
2. Uterine atony: The patient's significant blood loss and hypotension indicate that she has uterine atony, which is the failure of the uterus to contract after delivery. This condition can lead to continued bleeding and hemorrhage. The patient has received blood transfusions and methergin has been started to help manage uterine atony.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with a complex recent course of spontaneous vaginal delivery, endometritis, continued hemorrhage, and hypotension. She has undergone multiple surgical interventions including D&C, D&E, and bilateral uterine artery ligation and compression sutures. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and is on antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. Given her recent surgery and the presence of endometritis, sepsis should be closely monitored and managed promptly.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive, which may be due to a combination of sepsis and hypovolemia from blood loss. Fluid responsiveness has been observed, but close monitoring is necessary to maintain blood pressure.
3. Anemia: Secondary to blood loss and possible hemolysis/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the patient's hemoglobin levels are low. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness.
4. Uterine atony: Despite multiple surgical approaches, the patient's uterine atony persists. Continuing pitocin and methergine will help contract the uterus and reduce bleeding.
5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate levels indicate possible organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of organ function, particularly renal and hepatic function, is necessary.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman who presented with endometritis, uterine hemorrhage, hypotension, and respiratory failure. She underwent several surgical interventions including a D&C, D&E, and bilateral uterine artery ligation and compression sutures. The patient is currently critically ill, requiring invasive ventilation and has been receiving multiple infusions and antibiotics. Her condition is complicated by hypotension, pyometrium/endometritis, anemia, shock, uterine atony, and potential renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of endometritis and ongoing infection, which increases the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is essential.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and history of hemorrhage indicate a risk of further hemodynamic instability. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient has persistent low hematocrit levels, suggesting ongoing bleeding. Regular transfusion and close monitoring of hemoglobin levels are required.
4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's clinical course suggests the possibility of DIC, which is a serious complication characterized by abnormal clotting and bleeding. Monitoring fibrinogen levels, platelet counts, and other coagulation parameters is important.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored,"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 22yo AAF s/p vaginal delivery complicated by pyometrium and
   retained POCs, continued hemorrhage d/t uterine atony s/p d&c, d&e and
   b/l uterine atery ligation, hemodynamically stable and clinically
   improving.
   1. Pyometrium/ endometritis- s/p D&E w/ US showing fluid collection in
   pelvis
   - will continue Abx Vanc/ Gent/ Clinda broad coverage
   - continue trend fever curve (101s now from 104) and WBC
   - f/u OB recs- wanted ID c/s
   - f/u ID recs
   - CT pelvis w/ contrast showed no evidence of septic thrombophlebitis,
   known pyometrium
   - plan for SBT and extubation today
   - pain control w/ extubation, oxycodone, fentanyl +/- PCA
    2. Uterine atony-  profuse blood loss, hypotension and shock [**2-27**]
   septic and hemorrhagic physiology.
   - Continue monitor HCTs and DIC labs  [**Hospital1 **] instead of q4 h as per OB
   recs
   - Transfuse for HCT < 25, plt < 100, fibrinogen <100, INR >2
   - continue methergin and pitocin for management of uterine atony
   - f/u OB recs
   - if hemodynamically unstable, low threshold to call OB for OR-> pt
   consented for hysterectomy
   - for anemia, since HCT increasing could be [**2-27**] hemoconcentration or
   due to folate and iron deficiency, so will
   Supplement with iron and folate.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 22-year-old female who recently underwent a vaginal delivery and is now in the ICU due to complications related to postpartum hemorrhage. The main medical issues and potential complications include:

1. Pyometrium/endometritis: The patient has fluid collection in the pelvis, which suggests an infection in the uterus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been prescribed to cover the possible pathogens.

2. Uterine atony: The patient experienced profuse blood loss due to uterine atony, leading to hypotension and shock. The current management includes continuous monitoring of hematocrit levels, coagulation profile, and fibrinogen levels. Transfusion may be required if the patient's hematocrit drops below 25, platelet count below 100, fibrinogen below 100, or if the INR exceeds 2. Methergin and pitocin are being administered to manage uterine atony.

3. Hemodynamic instability: Given the history of shock and ongoing hemorrhage, the patient is at risk of recurrent hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt intervention with blood transfusions and uterine massage or additional surgical interventions may be necessary.

4. Thromboembolic events: The patient has received prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

5. Nutritional support: The patient's"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 22-year-old female who recently had a vaginal delivery and is currently admitted to the ICU with fevers, pyometrium (inflammation of the uterus), and retained products of conception (POCs). The patient also experienced significant vaginal bleeding and uterine atony, which is a condition where the uterus fails to contract properly after delivery. 

The patient underwent a dilation and evacuation procedure (D&E) with bilateral uterine artery ligation to manage the retained POCs. She has been doing well and is hemodynamically stable. However, the patient still has an elevated temperature and white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. 

The plan includes continuing antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Gentamicin, and Clindamycin. The fever trend and white blood cell count will be monitored, and further obstetric recommendations will be followed. A CT pelvis with contrast was performed, showing no evidence of septic thrombophlebitis, but confirming known pyometrium.

Regarding the uterine atony, the patient received a total of 6.5 liters of fluid and 3 units of blood. She had 2 units of packed red blood cells transfused this morning. The plan is to continue monitoring hematocrits and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs from Hospital1 instead of every 4 hours. If the patient's hemodynamic status becomes unstable, there"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old female who underwent a dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedure after experiencing significant vaginal bleeding and uterine atony following a vaginal delivery. The patient's condition has been complicated by pyometrium (inflammation of the uterine lining) and retained products of conception (POCs).

The patient's fever has improved from 104 degrees Fahrenheit to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken at 08:00 PM on [**2102-11-25**]. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure in the high 90s to low 100s, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Fluid balance shows an input of 9,684 mL and output of 6,080 mL since 12 AM. The patient's weight is currently 67 kg, with a decrease from the admission weight of 68.2 kg. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 4 mmHg.

The patient is receiving various medications, including propofol, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), famotidine (Pepcid), and fentanyl. She is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics for pyometrium/endometritis.

          Seen after extubation.
          She is doing well from a respiratory and hemodynamic
   standpoint.
          Pain is controlled on present regimen.
          She has two specific complaints:
   1)       Her right wrist hurts at the site of prior arterial
   punctures.  On exam, there is no erythema or fluctuance, but it is
   tender.  Distal sensation in the radial distribution is completely
   intact.  We will follow clinically for now since there are no signs of
   infection.  However, if pain is not improved soon, or if any signs of
   infection or neurologic signs develop, will ask hand surgery to see.
   2)       She is upset that she received a central line.  Although I was
   not caring for Ms. [**Known lastname 9674**] when the line was placed, the
   decisionmaking is well-documented (see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 529**]
s note from
   [**2102-11-25**] 05:33), as is the fact that
 since Ms. [**Known lastname 9674**] was
   intubated, sedated, hypotense, and septic
 the ICU team discussed the
   issue with her mother/HCP, who wished to proceed.  I reviewed this with
   her and significant other [**Name (NI) **], and answered all questions about how
   and why the decision was made.
   We will keep in ICU and monitor closely, since she is at meaningful
   risk for recrudescent sepsis or hemorrhage, and has just been
   extubated.
   35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman who has been experiencing uterine hemorrhage, uterine infection, hypotension, sepsis, and respiratory failure following a spontaneous vaginal delivery. The patient underwent a D&C, D&E, and bilateral uterine artery ligation with compression sutures. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Recrudescent sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with endometritis and has undergone surgical intervention to control the infection. However, the blood supply to the site of infection has been decreased due to the surgical intervention, so there is a risk of recurrence of sepsis.
2. Hemorrhage: The patient continues to have bleeding and requires close monitoring for any signs of rebleeding.
3. Respiratory failure: Although the patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial and will be extubated, she may still be at risk for respiratory complications.
4. Anemia: The patient may develop anemia due to ongoing blood loss and possible hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
5. Complications related to central line placement: The patient received a central line, which carries the risk of infection and other complications.
6. Arterial puncture site complications: The patient complains of pain at the site of arterial punctures, although there are no signs of infection or neurologic deficits at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   22-year-old woman with complex recent course of spontaneous vaginal
   delivery, endometritis, continued hemorrhage, and hypotension.  S/P
   D&C, D&E, and most recently bilateral uterine artery ligation and
   compression sutures.  Has been hemodynamically stable without bleeding
   overnight
   PYOMETRIUM / ENDOMETRITIS
   Continue present antibiotics (vanco, gent, clinda)
   Follow cultures
   Has undergone surgical control of site of infection.  However, blood
   supply to the site of infection is decreased because of surgical
   intervention, so need to maintain vigilance for recrudescent sepsis.
   Overall though, fever curve appears to be improving.
   ANEMIA
   secondary to blood loss and possible hemoloysis/DIC
   s/p uterine artery ligation and compression sutures
   DIC appears to be improving
 follow Hct, fibrinogen, etc. today
   UTERINE ATONY
   s/p multiple surgical approaches.  Continue pitocin and metherginE.
   Obstetrical service following very closely.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with a complex recent course of spontaneous vaginal delivery, endometritis, continued hemorrhage, and hypotension. She has undergone multiple surgical interventions including D&C, D&E, bilateral uterine artery ligation, and compression sutures. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection such as fever, elevated white blood cell count, and ongoing uterine hemorrhage. The presence of endometritis and the recent surgical procedures increase the risk of sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate support due to respiratory failure. This could be attributed to the underlying infection, hypotension, and possible adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Anemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss during delivery and subsequent surgical procedures, leading to anemia. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed is crucial.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's laboratory results show decreased fibrinogen levels and elevated lactic acid, which could indicate DIC. Close monitoring of clotting parameters and organ function is necessary.

5. Uterine atony: Despite multiple surgical interventions, the patient continues to experience uterine atony, leading to persistent bleeding. Continued administration of uterotonic agents like Pitocin and methylene blue"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 22-year-old African American female who underwent a vaginal delivery that was complicated by pyometrium (infection of the uterus) and retained placental fragments (POCs), leading to continued hemorrhage due to uterine atony (weakness of the uterus).
- The patient has undergone a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure, a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), and bilateral uterine artery ligation (tying off the blood vessels supplying the uterus) to control bleeding.
- The patient's condition has been hemodynamically stable and clinically improving.
- The patient was successfully extubated and is now breathing on her own.
- Antibiotic therapy has been adjusted based on recommendations from the Infectious Disease (ID) team, who also recommended discontinuing Vancomycin once blood cultures are negative for 72 hours. However, due to the high number of MRSA cases in postpartum women at this hospital, Vancomycin was restarted.
- Daily ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) levels are being monitored per ID recommendations.
- The patient's CRP level in the morning is 122.
- Pain control is being managed with IV Dilaudid as per obstetric recommendations.
- The patient is receiving D51/2NS (normal saline) at a rate of 100 cc/hr via IV fluid.
- The patient's blood cultures are all pending.
- A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed known post-surgical changes, pyometrium with heterogeneous enlarged irregular appearance of the uterus, fluid-filled endometrial cavity with irregular walls, associated pelvic free fluid, and mild wall thickening involving the adjacent bladder, sigmoid colon, and loop of small bowel within the right lower quadrant, which may represent mild associated inflammatory changes.
- The patient experienced another fever spike to 102.7°F at night, and the obstetrician wanted to take the patient to the operating room for a hysterectomy. However, the patient refused until her mother arrived, at which point a decision was made to delay surgery for now until the patient has another febrile episode.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The last doses of antibiotics administered to the patient were Gentamicin on 11/25/2102 at 11:36 PM, Clindamycin on 11/26/2102 at 10:00 AM, Doxycycline on 11/26/2102 at 7:11 PM, Vancomycin on 11/26/2102 at 9:00 PM, and Meropenem on 11/27/2102 at 3:03 AM.
- The patient is receiving other ICU medications, including Fentanyl and Famotidine (Pepcid).

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 22yo AAF s/p vaginal delivery complicated by pyometrium and
   retained POCs, continued hemorrhage d/t uterine atony s/p d&c, d&e and
   b/l uterine artery ligation, hemodynamically stable and clinically
   improving.
   1. Pyometrium/ fevers -  continued febrile episodes suggesting
   persistent infection
   - will continue broad Abx coverage with Vanc, Meropenem and Doxycycline
   per ID recs.  Increase Vanc dose to q8hrs .
   - F/u Vanc levels tomorrow AM
   -Continue to f/u Cultures
   - continue trend fever curve and WBC
   -F/u daily ESR and CRP
   - f/u OB recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - switch to PO oxycodone PRN for pain control.
   - Family meeting today at 1pm
   - F/u TTE to evaluate for endocarditis
    2. Uterine atony - The patient has remained hemodynamically stable
   with stable Hct and no evidence of active vaginal bleed.
   - Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **] and Transfuse for HCT < 25, or signs of active bleed
   - F/u DIC labs daily given several negative DIC labs at this point
   -Maintain active T&S
   - f/u OB recs
   - if hemodynamically unstable, evidence of worsening infection or
   bleed, low threshold to call OB for OR
   - Continue supplementation with iron and MVI.
   3. The patient has developed area on R wrist with significant amount of
   discomfort and parathesias, likely hematoma seconday to ABG, with
   concern for a possible median nerve compression
   - Vascular consult to evaluate hematoma/area of tenderness.
   FEN: Start the patient on clears, stop IVFs if pt. tolerates PO, blood
   products, replete lytes PRN

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 22-year-old female who is postpartum with complications including pyometrium and retained placental tissue. She underwent a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure, as well as bilateral uterine artery ligation due to persistent hemorrhage caused by uterine atony. The patient remains hemodynamically stable and clinically improving.

The patient continues to experience febrile episodes, suggesting a persistent infection. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated, including vancomycin, meropenem, and doxycycline, as recommended by the infectious disease team. The dosage of vancomycin will be increased to every 8 hours, and vancomycin levels will be monitored tomorrow morning. Cultures will be continued, and the trend of fever curve and white blood cell count will be followed. Daily ESR and CRP levels will also be monitored.

The patient's uterine atony has resolved, as she remains hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit levels and no evidence of active vaginal bleeding. However, daily monitoring of hematocrit and blood transfusion for hematocrit levels below 25 will be continued. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs will be monitored daily since previous DIC labs were negative. Active tissue and surgical consultation will be maintained.

Additionally, the patient has developed a wrist hematoma with discomfort and paresthesias, likely secondary to arterial blood gas (AB"

","The patient is a critically ill female with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient was previously in shock due to a combination of sepsis and hypovolemia, resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient underwent a dilation and curettage (D&C) and ligation of the uterine artery to control bleeding. 

The patient is currently receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy for pyometrium, which is an infection within the uterus. The patient's fluids are being closely monitored to maintain euvolemia and prevent hypovolemia. 

The patient's right wrist pain is attributed to arterial blood gas (ABG) attempts and is suspected to be a hematoma. Local compression and consideration of vascular surgery for possible compartment syndrome are recommended.

The patient is also experiencing uterine atony, which is a condition where the uterus fails to contract after delivery. Pittocin and methergin are being administered to aid in uterine contraction.

Renal function is preserved, and the patient's potassium levels have been repleted. Arterial lines have been placed for ongoing monitoring.

Nutritional support is being advanced as tolerated. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently admitted to the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   SHOCK
 Resolved.  Combination of sepsis (pyometrium) and hypovolemia
   (blood loss).  s/p DIC.  Continue current management and level of
   support.
   PYOMETREIUM -- Continue antimicrobials
   (Vanco/Meropenim/Doxicycline/Clinda).  Monitor exam.  Hopefully will
   avoid hysterectomy.  OB service following.
   ANEMIA -- following initial D&C, returned to OR for ligation of uterine
   arteries.  Now with no further evidence for active bleeding.  Transfuse
   if Hct <25.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Euvolemic.  Monitor I/O, maintain balance.
   RIGHT WRIST PAIN -- related to ABG attempts.  Suspect hematoma with
   local compression.  Heat or cold pack.  Consider Vascular Surgery to
   evaluate for possible compartment syndrome.
   UTERINE ATONY
 s/p D&C.  a/p pittocin and methergin, and most recently
   surgical ligation of uterus.  Obstetrical service following.
   RENAL FUNCTION
 preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0
   LINES
 consider discontinuation of A-line and cordis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- advance diet as tolerated.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill female with a chief complaint of sepsis. She has a history of pyometrium, anemia, fluids repletion, right wrist pain, uterine atony, renal function preservation, hypokalemia, and lines. The patient underwent a D&C procedure and subsequently developed DIC. She was transfused and her uterus was ligated. Her vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. She is currently extubated and experiencing moderate pain in the right wrist area, with paresthesias in the right thumb. The patient's neurological status is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time, movement is purposeful, and tone is normal. Laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities. The patient's renal function is preserved. The plan includes continuing antimicrobials, monitoring examination, and possibly avoiding hysterectomy. She will be followed by the OB service. The patient's anemia has been managed with initial D&C and ligation of uterine arteries. Fluids are replete, and she is euvolemic. Right wrist pain is suspected to be due to a hematoma with local compression. The patient also has uterine atony post-D&C, which has been managed with pitocin and methergin, and surgical ligation of the uterus. The"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Vacomycin dose was changed to 1000mg q8hrs.  Diet was advanced to
   clears.
   TTE showed no endocarditis, not vascular regurg and normal systolic
   function.
   Pt. was switched to PO oxycodone PRN for pain control.  Arterial line
   and cordis were d/c
d.  Famotidine was d/c
d.  Vascular surgery  was
   consulted about right wrist pain and parasthesias, and determined that
   there was no vascular injury.
   Wrist symptoms were also evaluated by plastic surgery, and identified a
   likely injury to sensory branch of radial nerve, recommend splinting of
   wrist.  X-ray of wrist  (3 views of wrist ) showed no fracture.
   The patient was febrile overnight to 101.2, the patient was made NPO,
   given IVF fluids, am dose of Heparin SC held, because of possibility
   that the patient may require TAH in AM.
   However, this AM the pt. fevers subsided.  She reports that her
   abdominal pain is under control.  Denies SOB, CP, n/v.  Small amount of
   bloody abdominal discharge on pad.  Reports right neck pain at the site
   of R IJ catheter insertion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old female who underwent a vaginal delivery complicated by pyometrium and retained placental fragments. She experienced hemorrhage due to uterine atony and underwent a dilation and curettage (D&C), dilation and evacuation (D&E), and bilateral uterine artery ligation. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and clinically improving.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Pyometrium/fevers: The patient initially had fevers, but they have subsided. Broad antibiotic coverage should be continued as per Infectious Disease recommendations, with an increased dose of Vancomycin every 8 hours.

2. Uterine atony: The patient's uterine atony has been managed, but close monitoring of hemoglobin (Hct) levels is necessary. If the Hct falls below 25 or if there are signs of active bleeding, transfusion should be considered. Daily labs for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) should be followed up on, and maintenance of active transfusion and suspension with iron and Multivitamins (MVI) is advised. Low threshold should be maintained for calling obstetrics for an operation room (OR) if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, shows signs of worsening infection or bleed.

3. Wrist pain: The patient has developed discomfort and paresthesias in the right wrist, likely due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old female who underwent a vaginal delivery complicated by pyometrium and retained placental fragments. She experienced continued hemorrhage due to uterine atony after a dilation and curettage procedure, as well as bilateral uterine artery ligation. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and clinically improving.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the progress note are as follows:

1. Pyometrium/fevers: The patient continues to have febrile episodes, which suggest persistent infection. This could lead to further complications such as sepsis or endometritis if not properly managed.

2. Uterine atony: Although the patient has remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit levels and no evidence of active vaginal bleed, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or persistent uterine atony. This could potentially lead to hypovolemic shock or the need for additional blood transfusions.

3. Discomfort and paresthesias in the right wrist: The patient has developed an area on her right wrist with significant discomfort and paresthesias, likely due to a hematoma secondary to arterial blood gas (ABG) insertion. There is concern for possible median nerve compression. If left untreated, this could lead to persistent pain, nerve damage, or even compartment syndrome.

Overall, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include persistent infection with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has shown improvement over the past 24 hours, including being up in a chair and tolerating small quantities of clear liquids. Fever has also been managed.

The patient's medical history includes endometritis, anemia, fluids management, right wrist pain, uterine atony, shock, renal function, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and lines. The patient's current condition indicates that the shock has resolved and renal function is preserved. However, there are ongoing concerns regarding nutritional support, activity level, and lines management.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 97/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on sinus tachycardia.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of jaundice, rash, or edema. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and regular heart rhythm. Respiratory examination is clear, and abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender bowel sounds. Neurologic examination demonstrates attentiveness, purposeful movement, and normal tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemat"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis. The patient has been improving overall, including being up in a chair and tolerating small quantities of clear liquids. Her fever has also decreased. The patient has a history of endometritis, anemia, fluids repletion, right wrist pain, uterine atony, shock, renal function preservation, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 97/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endometritis: The patient has been diagnosed with endometritis, which is an infection of the uterine lining. It is important to monitor for worsening symptoms such as fever, increased uterine tenderness, and foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Antibiotics should be continued as prescribed.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can be managed through blood transfusion if the hematocrit (Hct) level falls below 25%. Close monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin and Hct levels is necessary to determine if transfusion is needed.
3. Fluids: The patient's fluid balance needs to be maintained to prevent dehydration or fluid overload. Monitoring intake and output is crucial in this regard.
4. Right Wrist Pain: The patient's right wrist pain is likely due to a hematoma from attempts at obtaining blood gases. Local compression and heat or cold packs can provide symptomatic relief. Vascular and Plastic Surgery evaluation is recommended to assess for compartment syndrome and consider hand splinting if necessary.
5. Uterine Atony: The patient has uterine atony, which is a common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Medications such as oxytocin and methylergonovine can be used to promote uterine contraction. Surgical ligation of the uterus may be considered if medical management fails.
6. Shock: The patient had resolved shock due to sepsis and hypovolemia. Continued monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is essential to ensure the patient remains stable.
7. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is preserved, but it is important to monitor urine output and serum creatinine levels to detect any changes in kidney function.
8. Hypokalemia and Hypocalcemia: The patient's potassium and calcium levels are low and require repletion. Intravenous administration of potassium and calcium is necessary to correct these electrolyte imbalances.
9. Lines: The patient has multiple lines, including a central line. Once peripheral lines are established, the central line can be discontinued to reduce the risk of infection.
10. Nutritional Support: The patient's nutritional status should be monitored, and diet advancement should be done gradually as tolerated.
11. Activity: The patient should be encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and promote overall recovery."
