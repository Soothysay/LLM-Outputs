   52 y/o M with severe COPD on home O2 s/p trach, tracheomalacia s/p
   tracheal stent, and right phrenic nerve dysfunction presented with
   acute respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has some mild chemical
   irritation from blood inhalation and manipulation of his tracheostomy
   yesterday resulting in easily triggered bronchospasm. He has very
   little reserve so likely very small disruptions can initiate
   exacerbation. He is unlikely to have an acute pulmonary infection at
   this time. Currently, he is doing well on MMV which is an appropriate
   mode given his periods of apnea (likely due to pain meds), but we will
   need to calculate the auto-peep and make sure that his peep is
   appropriate.
   - treat for COPD exacerbation with IV steroids, frequent MDI's, rest on
   trach overnight before attempting wean, and azithromycin.
   - pain control will help with preventing hyperventilation and
   hyperinflation/auto-peep
   - IP is aware that patient is here and will come by to take a look at
   trach
   - No need for meropenem, patient is likely colonized with multi-drug
   resistant pseudomonas, but not currently actively infected
   - wean gently tomorrow as tolerated
   .
   # Cellulitis: patient's right lower extremity is usually slightly more
   edematous. There is evidence of stasis. The erythema is worse per the
   patient, has been treated for MRSA cellulitis in the past.
   - vanco 1g q12 x 7-10 days
   .
   # DM2: patient is on a lispro sliding scale as an outpatient. Continue
   sliding scale here and monitor fingersticks.
   # FEN:  NPO for now. In the morning if we can wean, perhaps we can
   advance diet at that time. replete lytes prn. IVF as needed for BP
   support.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with severe COPD, tracheostomy, tracheomalacia, and right phrenic nerve dysfunction. He presented with acute respiratory distress and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents. He has been treated for MRSA cellulitis in the past.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience exacerbation of respiratory failure due to easily triggered bronchospasm, chemical irritation from blood inhalation, and manipulation of his tracheostomy.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has evidence of cellulitis in his right lower extremity, which has been treated for MRSA in the past. It is important to monitor and treat this condition with appropriate antibiotics.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DM2): The patient's diabetes management should be continued with lispro sliding scale and monitoring fingersticks.
4. Feeding Intolerance (FEN): The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), but may be advanced to a diet if weaning from the ventilator is successful. It is important to replete electrolytes as needed.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may require IV fluid support.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was started on invasive ventilation due to a COPD exacerbation precipitated by aspiration. The patient has shown improvement and is now on intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) mode. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 111/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's pain level is moderate at 5-15 on a scale of 1-10, primarily in the back.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, likely due to hypovolemia. This could compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management should be implemented to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

3. Right Lower Extremity Cellulitis: The patient has a diagnosis of right LE cellulitis. This infection needs to be treated promptly to prevent worsening and potential sepsis. Intravenous antibiotics, such as vancomycin, should"

The patient is a 52-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who has undergone tracheostomy and tracheal stent placement. He also has right phrenic nerve dysfunction, which has resulted in respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress last night and was given medication therapy and placed back on the ventilator with pressure support.

The patient has allergies to codeine, Compazine (Prochlorperazine Maleate), penicillins, and metformin. He is currently on various medications including hydromorphone (Dilaudid) and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 95/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is still on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy collar and is receiving supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination reveals diffuse coarse rhonchi and mild end expiratory wheezing in the lungs, but the patient is not showing signs of labored breathing. His abdomen is soft with good bowel sounds, and there are no abnormalities noted in the cardiovascular or extremity assessments. However, the patient does have bilateral erythema and warmth around both shins, consistent with erythema and warmth, but without any lesions or edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with severe COPD, who underwent tracheostomy and tracheal stenting. He presented with respiratory distress and LE cellulitis. He was placed on mechanical ventilation but experienced a single episode of respiratory distress and was given MDI treatment before being placed back on ventilatory support with pressure support (PS 5-14). The patient has allergies to codeine, Compazine, penicillins, and metformin. He is currently on hydromorphone for pain control.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, transition from mechanical ventilation to tracheal collar, and resolution of respiratory distress with the use of MDI treatment. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/66 mmHg to 73/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse coarse rhonchi, mild-to-moderate end expiratory wheezing, nonlabored breathing, and bilateral erythema and warmth around both shins without any apparent lesions or edema. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and glucose levels. Microbiology tests are pending.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual experiencing respiratory distress and failure. The patient has a history of severe COPD and underwent a tracheotomy due to upper airway obstruction caused by granulation tissue. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's vital signs show a stable heart rate (69 bpm), blood pressure within normal limits (101/69 mmHg), respiratory rate within expected range (14 breaths per minute), and slightly low oxygen saturation (92%). The patient's temperature is within normal limits (36.9°C).

The patient has received various treatments including antibiotics (Vancomycin), pain medications (Hydromorphone), and anticoagulants (SQ UF Heparin). The patient's laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Blood glucose levels are also within normal range.

The patient has shown some improvement in their condition, as they were able to tolerate being off ventilator support for more than six hours and briefly used a Passy-Muir valve to communicate during rounds. However, the patient remains anxious.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include worsening respiratory failure, further episodes of upper airway obstruction, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the possibility of diastolic heart failure due to the patient's positive fluid balance.

It is important for the medical team to closely monitor the patient's respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress, upper airway obstruction (granulation tissue
   associated with tracheotomy tube), COPD exacerbation.
   Respiratory Failure -- acute on chronic resp failure.  Underlying COPD
   (severe), granulation tissue around tracheotomy tube.  Possible
   componant of diastolic CHF.
   Fluids -- net positive fluid balance.  Concerns for diastolic
   dysfunction, will hold fluids.  [**Month (only) 60**] require net diuresis.
   Cellulitis -- chronic, improved.  iv antimicrobials (Vanco)
   Nutrition -- hope to resume PO meds now that on trach collar.
   Back pain -- chronic.  Continue pain meds.
   Anxiety

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and failure. The patient has a history of COPD, and there is evidence of upper airway obstruction due to granulation tissue around the tracheotomy tube. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy.

24-hour events:
- The patient had a PICC line inserted on 08/04/2125 at 02:00 PM.
- The patient tolerated the trache collar for over 6 hours but developed anxiety and resumed intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPSB) mode on the ventilator.
- The patient tolerated the passage of a Passé-Muir valve during rounds.
- The patient has allergies to codeine, Compazine, penicillins, and metformin.
- The patient received vancomycin as the last dose of antibiotics on 08/04/2125 at 08:00 PM.
- The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including hydromorphone (Dilaudid), which was started on 08/05/2125 at 07:59 AM.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of"

   CXR [**2125-8-6**]:  Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2125-8-5**].
   The lung volumes remain very low. The bibasal opacities are consistent
   with
   atelectasis that might be related to low lung volumes. The
   cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is unchanged. The tracheostomy is at the midline with its
   tip
   terminating approximately 5 cm above the carina. The right PICC line
   tip is
   most likely in the proximal right atrium but precise evaluation is
   difficult
   due to low lung volumes. Small bilateral pleural effusion cannot be
   excluded.
   No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated but engorged perihilar vessels
   are
   and again might be related to low lung volumes. No pneumothorax.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a history of tracheostomy, tracheomalacia, and right phrenic nerve dysfunction. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing intermittent shortness of breath and chest tightness overnight. His right lower leg shows increased erythema compared to yesterday, but he reports no significant pain. The patient has allergies to codeine, Compazine (oral), penicillins, and metformin. He is currently receiving hydromorphone (Dilaudid) infusion for pain management. The patient has expressed a desire to transition to oral oxycodone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and recent respiratory failure indicate a high risk for recurrent respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory effort, and ABG analysis will be necessary.
2. Tracheomalacia: The patient's tracheomalacia, along with the tracheostomy, increases the risk of airway collapse and obstruction. Close monitoring of respiratory status and tracheal stability is crucial.
3. Right Phrenic Nerve Dysfunction: The patient's right phrenic nerve dysfunction can lead to diaphragmatic paralysis or weakness on the right side. This may contribute to respiratory difficulties and the need for ventilatory support.
4. Cellulitis: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with severe COPD who is currently on home oxygen and has undergone tracheostomy, tracheomalacia repair, and right phrenic nerve dysfunction. The patient required ventilator support due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic back pain and is currently on IV Dilaudid for pain control. The patient also has bilateral lower extremity cellulitis with a history of MRSA, and is currently being treated with vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of severe COPD and required ventilator support in the past. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if the patient does not achieve adequate pain control and experiences anxiety, tachypnea, and hyperinflation.

2. Bacterial Infection: The patient has bilateral lower extremity cellulitis with a history of MRSA. There is a risk of bacterial infection spreading to other parts of the body if appropriate antibiotics are not administered.

3. Chronic Back Pain: The patient has a history of chronic back pain and is currently on IV Dilaudid for pain control. There is a risk of inadequate pain management if the patient transitions to oral pain medications and experiences breakthrough pain.

   The lung volumes remain very low. The bibasal opacities are consistent
   with
   atelectasis that might be related to low lung volumes. The
   cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is unchanged. The tracheostomy is at the midline with its
   tip
   terminating approximately 5 cm above the carina. The right PICC line
   tip is
   most likely in the proximal right atrium but precise evaluation is
   difficult
   due to low lung volumes. Small bilateral pleural effusion cannot be
   excluded.
   No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated but engorged perihilar vessels
   are
   and again might be related to low lung volumes. No pneumothorax.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and tracheal stent placement due to tracheomalacia, as well as right phrenic nerve dysfunction.

The patient's current condition includes continued intermittent shortness of breath (SOB) and chest tightness, with mild expiratory wheezes and rhonchi bilaterally, and mild bibasilar crackles on lung examination. The patient also has large patches of erythema on the right lower leg and smaller patches on the left lower leg, which are mildly tender but predominantly flat without visible sores or drainage.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on tracheostomy collar.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 249 K/uL, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, glucose level of 94 mg/dL, and C-reactive"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with severe COPD who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress after manipulation of a tracheal stent. The patient's current condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD and was admitted with respiratory distress. Although his symptoms have improved, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to bronchospasm or exacerbation of COPD.

2. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis on his right lower extremity. It is important to continue the current treatment plan, including completing a 7-day course of vancomycin.

3. Back Pain: The patient has chronic back pain that has been exacerbated by lying in bed for several days. There may be an element of medication seeking involved. The plan is to transition to a home regimen of PO opiates.

4. Tracheomalacia: The patient also has tracheomalacia, which can lead to airway collapse and obstruction, potentially causing respiratory distress.

5. Medication Allergies: The patient has known allergies to codeine, Compazine (Oral), penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents. These allergies need to be considered when prescribing medications in the future.

6. Potential Infections: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay, there is a risk of developing infections such"

   52M with severe copd on trach, also with tracheomalacia, admitted to
   micu with respiratory distress after manipulation of tracheal stent.
   Etiology of respiratory decompensation is likley due to bronchospasm
   from upper airway debris from trach manipulation. Pt also intially
   treated for COPD exacerbation with increase on chronic prednisone and
   abx, but abx stopped because on reassessment there was little evidence
   of bronchitis. The symptoms have imrpved dramatically and patient has
   alsmost returnt to his baseline. Other acive issues include acute on
   chronic back pain, that is also improving while he is being
   transitioned from IV to PO pain meds:
   Respiratory Failure:
   -continue prednisone with a very slow taper
   -continue trach collar

   Cellulitis:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with severe COPD and tracheomalacia, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress after manipulation of tracheal stent. The patient's symptoms have improved, but he still experiences intermittent tachypnea. He is currently on tracheal collar, and his condition is expected to improve with continued care. Other issues include acute on chronic back pain and cellulitis on the right lower leg, which are both improving. The patient will be transferred to pulmonary rehabilitation and long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and tracheomalacia put him at risk for respiratory failure. Continuous use of tracheal collar and slow tapering of prednisone are planned to manage this condition.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis on the right lower leg, which requires completion of a 7-day course of vancomycin.
3. Back Pain: The patient has chronic back pain, exacerbated by prolonged bed rest. Transitioning to home regimen of PO opiates is planned to manage this condition.
4. Medication Seeking Behavior: There is an element of medication seeking behavior contributing to the patient's back pain.
5. Prolonged ICU Stay: The patient's prolonged ICU stay may lead to complications such as ICU-acquired infections, delirium, or pressure ulcers.
6. Weaning off Ventilatory Support: The patient"
