","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe COPD and chronic respiratory failure. She presents with pneumonia and an acute exacerbation of COPD, requiring admission to the MICU. The patient has been on invasive ventilation and has shown signs of hypotension, requiring the use of pressors. She has also experienced difficulty in ventilating, with increasing respiratory rate and tidal volume. An arterial line was placed, and the patient was given antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin for broad bacterial coverage. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and possible endobronchial lesion contributing to respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and multilobar pneumonia have led to respiratory failure. The use of invasive ventilation and appropriate antibiotics will be crucial in managing this condition. Potential complications include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in gas exchange.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis indicate sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care are essential to manage sepsis and prevent organ dysfunction.

3. Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest chronic kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate fluid management will be necessary to prevent further deterioration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory failure and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypoxemia, and respiratory distress. She is on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen catheter, and arterial line. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 85-90 mmHg, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 50% FiO2. The patient's physical examination reveals moderate respiratory distress, speaking in three-word phrases, pursed-lipped breathing, and accessory muscle use. Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 59.7 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 1.4 mmol/L, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 113 mEq/L. The patient's medical history includes idiopathic right upper lobe collapse, smoking history, and chronic respiratory disease.

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   A 67 yo woman with a history of very severe COPD on home O2 presents
   with pneumonia and COPD exacerbation requiring MICU admission.
   .
   #  Pneumonia:  Multilobar infiltrates on CXR.  Labs with significant
   leukocytosis and L shift, likely indicative of bacterial infection.
   Afebrile currently, although report of ""chills"" at home.  Current SBP
   95-105 is likely low for patient (SBP 120-150 in clinic notes)  and may
   be a signal of impending sepsis.  Regarding the pneumonia itself, given
   history of idiopathic RUL collapse in [**5-4**], it is possible that she
   has some sort of endobronchial lesion (? malignancy given smoking hx)
   contributing.  In any case, because of her very severe baseline
   obstructive disease, she is in a very tenuous respiratory place right
   now.
   - vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin for broad bacterial coverage
   including atypical pathogens.  (Lives in [**Hospital3 22**] facility,
   chronic respiratory disease so will treat as if HCAP.)
   - blood cx
   - sputum cx
   - urinary legionella antigen
   - IVF - will give 1 L NS bolus now and continuing with goal MAP >65,
   goal uop >35 cc/h.  Previous echo with NL EF.
   - repeat CXR in AM (will get PA/Lat for better visualization)
   - serial ABG (will not repeat overnight unless O2 Saturation falls)
   - trend WBC (will be complicated by steroids)
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] whether CT and/or bronchoscopy may be
   indicated for better visualization of possible endobronchial lesion
   that may be contributing to recurrent pathology in that lobe
   .
   #  COPD:  very severe COPD with FEV1 <30% predicted.  No history
   intubation.  Currently very tachypneic with poor air movement.
   - serial ABG as above
   - methylprednisolone 40 mg q8h (will hold off on 125mg given
   concominant infecitious picture)
   - fluticasone inh
   - albuterol nebs q1h for now, decrease to q6h as tolerated
   - ipratropium nebs q6h
   - may require intubation if tires

   #  hx hypertension:  borderline hypotensive currently
   - hold all antihypertensives

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. She is currently on invasive ventilation and has been intubated due to difficulty ventilating. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 97.6°F, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 96/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). 

The patient's physical examination reveals moderate respiratory distress, speaking in three-word phrases, pursed-lipped breathing, and the use of accessory muscles. Her chest examination shows very poor air movement and diffusely present expiratory wheezes. The cardiac examination is difficult to assess under breath sounds but is described as distant and regular with no murmurs audible. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 59.7 thousand cells per microliter, elevated glucose levels at 174 mg/dL, hyponatremia with sodium levels at 113 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with potassium levels at 4.7 mEq/L, and an elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.21"

   67 yo w/ prior smoker w/ severe COPD on home O2 admitted w/ resp
   failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
   1. Resp failure- severe COPD exac due to pneumonia. Prior partial RUL
   collapse from [**5-4**] will need further evaluation down the road and might
   have predisposed to current pna
   -will have asymmetric lung physiology as L lung is emphysematous and R
   lung is infected, so will need to be cautious of L lung volu- and
   [**Doctor Last Name **]-trauma
   -stay as close to ARDSnet ventilation as acidemia allows, currently at
   about 8-9cc/kg for Vt
   -wean FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60
   -tolerate autoPEEP for now as Pplat < 30 and hemodyn stable
   -vanco + cefepime + azithro (change to IV) for now
   -f/u GPCs in sputum, other cx data
   -tx COPD exac w/ Solu-Medrol --> incr to 125 q8 and scheduled nebs
   -will need CT scan at some point to re-evaluate
   2.  Shock- likely multifactorial, sepsis vs meds
   -recent echo [**10-4**] w/ nl echo
   -CVP goal, MAP goals reached; wean norepi gtt as tolerated
   -might become more conservative w/ fluids (will use LR given high Cl)
   given high FiO2 req't and little gross pulse pressure variation or CVP
   variation

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with severe COPD who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His condition has been complicated by fluid-unresponsive hypotension, requiring norepinephrine infusion. He also has persistent autoPEEP of 9. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, high glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function. Imaging reveals right-sided opacification and left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. The plan includes staying close to ARDSnet ventilation, weaning FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60, tolerating autoPEEP, and conducting further evaluation of the partial right upper lobe collapse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation and pneumonia can lead to worsening respiratory failure, requiring close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings.
2. Shock: The patient's likely multifactorial shock may be due to sepsis or medications. It is important to monitor hemodynamic parameters and adjust fluid and vasopressor therapy accordingly.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine and low urine output suggest possible ARF, which could be secondary to hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion. Supportive"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo w/ prior smoker w/ severe COPD on home O2 admitted w/ resp
   failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
   1. Resp failure- severe COPD exac due to pneumonia. Prior partial RUL
   collapse from [**5-4**] will need further evaluation down the road and might
   have predisposed to current pna
   -will have asymmetric lung physiology as L lung is emphysematous and R
   lung is infected, so will need to be cautious of L lung volu- and
   [**Doctor Last Name **]-trauma
   -stay as close to ARDSnet ventilation as acidemia allows, currently at
   about 8-9cc/kg for Vt
   -wean FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60
   -tolerate autoPEEP for now as Pplat < 30 and hemodyn stable
   -vanco + cefepime + azithro (change to IV) for now
   -f/u GPCs in sputum, other cx data
   -tx COPD exac w/ Solu-Medrol --> incr to 125 q8 and scheduled nebs
   -will need CT scan at some point to re-evaluate
   2.  Shock- likely multifactorial, sepsis vs meds
   -recent echo [**10-4**] w/ nl echo
   -CVP goal, MAP goals reached; wean norepi gtt as tolerated
   -might become more conservative w/ fluids (will use LR given high Cl)
   given high FiO2 req't and little gross pulse pressure variation or CVP
   variation
   3. ARF- supportive mgmt, due to #2 as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe COPD and prior smoking, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 80% to maintain SpO2 levels. The patient is also receiving norepinephrine for fluid-unresponsive hypotension. Her ABG results show respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.21. There is evidence of infection with GPCs found in her sputum, and she is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock and acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis or pre-renal causes. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 107/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation and pneumonia have resulted in respiratory failure. The ongoing management includes staying close to ARDSnet ventilation, weaning FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60, tolerating autoPEEP for now as Pplat < 30 and hemodynamics stable, and continuing with antibiotics.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial shock, possibly due to"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   A 67 yo woman with a history of very severe COPD on home O2 presents
   with pneumonia and COPD exacerbation requiring MICU admission.
   #  Respiratory failure: Multilobar Pneumonia & COPD. Possible that she
   has some sort of endobronchial lesion (? malignancy given smoking hx)
   contributing.  In any case, because of her very severe baseline
   obstructive disease, she is in a very tenuous respiratory place right
   now.  GPCs in pairs, Legionella (-)
   - vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin for broad bacterial coverage
   including atypical pathogens.  (Lives in [**Hospital3 22**] facility,
   chronic respiratory disease so will treat as if HCAP.)
   - F/U blood cx
   - ABG on current settings, tolerate large tidal volumes
   - Plateaus <30 as most ventilation is going to the L lung, maintain
   ARDSnet ventilation as pH tolerates
   - methylprednisolone to 125 mg q8h
   - fluticasone inh
   - albuterol nebs q1h for now, decrease to q6h as tolerated
   - ipratropium nebs q6h
   #. Shock: Septic from PNA, leukocytosis, requiring pressors but is
   fluid responsive.  No recent abx exposure.
   - Abx as above
   - Norepi as needed to keep MAP >65, allow for sedation
   - trend WBC (will be complicated by steroids)
   - Send C. Diff
   - Measure SvO2 to r/o cardiogenic shock
   # kidney injury:  Unclear if this is acute or chronic, but did improve
   with signficant fluid hydration.
   -  F/U urine lytes
   -  trend creatinine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with pneumonia and acute exacerbation of COPD. She is currently intubated and admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has multilobar pneumonia and severe baseline obstructive disease, which places her in a tenuous respiratory state.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's severe COPD and pneumonia put her at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and worsening hypoxemia.
2. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's age and underlying hypertension, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
3. Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney injury, which could be exacerbated by fluid resuscitation or other interventions.
4. Infection: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for developing new infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
5. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility due to intubation increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can predispose the patient to DVT"

   A 67 yo woman with a history of very severe COPD on home O2 presents
   with pneumonia and COPD exacerbation requiring MICU admission.
   #  Respiratory failure: Multilobar Pneumonia & COPD. Possible that she
   has some sort of endobronchial lesion (? malignancy given smoking hx)
   contributing.  In any case, because of her very severe baseline
   obstructive disease, she is in a very tenuous respiratory place right
   now.  GPCs in pairs, Legionella (-)
   - vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin for broad bacterial coverage
   including atypical pathogens.  (Lives in [**Hospital3 22**] facility,
   chronic respiratory disease so will treat as if HCAP.)
   - F/U blood cx
   - ABG on current settings, tolerate large tidal volumes
   - Plateaus <30 as most ventilation is going to the L lung, maintain
   ARDSnet ventilation as pH tolerates
   - methylprednisolone to 125 mg q8h
   - fluticasone inh
   - albuterol nebs q1h for now, decrease to q6h as tolerated
   - ipratropium nebs q6h
   #. Shock: Septic from PNA, leukocytosis, requiring pressors but is
   fluid responsive.  No recent abx exposure.
   - Abx as above
   - Norepi as needed to keep MAP >65, allow for sedation
   - trend WBC (will be complicated by steroids)
   - Send C. Diff
   - Measure SvO2 to r/o cardiogenic shock
   # kidney injury:  Unclear if this is acute or chronic, but did improve
   with signficant fluid hydration.
   -  F/U urine lytes
   -  trend creatinine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for pneumonia and an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 73 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%. Her temperature is 37.7°C and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 20 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, azithromycin, cefepime, and vancomycin. She is also receiving methylprednisolone, fluticasone, albuterol nebs, ipratropium nebs, and other medications as per her treatment plan.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 42.2 K/uL and a platelet count of 375 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 24 mg/dL, glucose is 139 mg/dL, sodium is 135 mEq/L, potassium is 4.1 mEq/L, chloride is 102 mEq/L, calcium is 7.8 mg/dL, and magnesium is 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH 7.29, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 51 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 125 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) 93%. Her lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia and COPD exacerbation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. She also has a history of hypertension and possible kidney injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, atelectasis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).

The patient's overall condition requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, hemodynamics, infection, and other comor"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, with an acute exacerbation. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/60 to 112/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 6,768 mL and total output of 1,520 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,248 mL. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 42.2 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels at 1.1 mg/dL, and elevated glucose levels at 161 mg/dL. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, vasopressors, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. The patient's blood pressure is being supported with norepinephrine. She has leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels, indicating possible sepsis. Her kidney function has improved with significant fluid hydration. The patient's condition remains tenuous, and further investigations are needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and multilobar pneumonia put her at high risk for respiratory failure. Maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation while weaning off mechanical ventilation will be crucial.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and pressor requirement suggest possible sepsis secondary to the pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of organ dysfunction and continued antibiotic therapy are essential.
3. Kidney Injury: Although the patient's kidney function has improved, close monitoring of renal parameters and fluid balance is"

   failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
   1. Resp failure- severe COPD exac due to pneumonia. Prior partial RUL
   collapse from [**5-4**] will need further evaluation down the road and might
   have predisposed to current pna
   -will have asymmetric lung physiology as L lung is emphysematous and R
   lung is infected, so will need to be cautious of L lung volu- and
   [**Doctor Last Name **]-trauma
   -wean FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60
   -tolerate autoPEEP for now as Pplat < 30 and hemodyn stable
   -assess spont breathing tolerance today but caution on weaning
   -will lighten sedation and assess breathing
   -vanco + cefepime + azithro (change to IV) for now --> narrow tommorrow
   based on cx data
   -tx COPD exac w/ Solu-Medrol --> cont 125 q8 today and scheduled nebs
   -will need CT scan at some point to re-evaluate, poss bronch
   2.  Shock- likely multifactorial, sepsis vs meds
   -recent echo [**10-4**] w/ nl EF
   -CVP goal, MAP goals reached; wean norepi gtt as tolerated
   -might become more conservative w/ fluids (will use LR given high Cl)

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old individual with a history of severe COPD and prior smoking. They were admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. The patient requires mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and inotropic support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of weaning off the ventilator.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which could potentially lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection. It is crucial to monitor the response to antibiotics and adjust treatment based on culture results.

3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation needs to be carefully managed to prevent further complications, such as respiratory failure or lung damage. Regular assessment of respiratory function and appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions should be implemented.

4. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock, possibly due to sepsis or medication-related factors. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, including blood pressure and cardiac output, will be essential to guide fluid and inotropic therapy.

5. Sedation and Delirium: The patient is receiving sedatives, which can increase the risk of delirium and prolonged sedation. Frequent assessments of mental status and gradual reduction of sedation should"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo w/ prior smoker w/ severe COPD on home O2 admitted w/ resp
   failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
   1. Resp failure- severe COPD exac due to pneumonia. Prior partial RUL
   collapse from [**5-4**] will need further evaluation down the road and might
   have predisposed to current pna
   -will have asymmetric lung physiology as L lung is emphysematous and R
   lung is infected, so will need to be cautious of L lung volu- and
   [**Doctor Last Name **]-trauma
   -wean FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60
   -tolerate autoPEEP for now as Pplat < 30 and hemodyn stable
   -assess spont breathing tolerance today but caution on weaning
   -will lighten sedation and assess breathing
   -vanco + cefepime + azithro (change to IV) for now --> narrow tommorrow
   based on cx data
   -tx COPD exac w/ Solu-Medrol --> cont 125 q8 today and scheduled nebs
   -will need CT scan at some point to re-evaluate, poss bronch
   2.  Shock- likely multifactorial, sepsis vs meds
   -recent echo [**10-4**] w/ nl EF
   -CVP goal, MAP goals reached; wean norepi gtt as tolerated
   -might become more conservative w/ fluids (will use LR given high Cl)
   given high FiO2 req't and little gross pulse pressure variation or CVP

   67 yo women with severe COPD, admitted with respiratory failure and
   multifocal PNA.   Slow improved, but has weaned off pressors.  Still
   with significant oxygen requirement.  Acting like he has a shunt may be
   intrapulmonary through lung or intracardiac.  Had echo on [**10-4**] with
   bubble study that showed no shunt.
   Exam:  patient sedated, unresponsive.  Lung exam with coarse rales
   throughout right lung.
   A/P
   Respiratory failure:  Slow improvement, WBC coming down.  Given
   severity of PNA and significant shunt, likely will have continued slow
   recovery.

   with pneumonia and COPD exacerbation requiring MICU admission.
   #  Respiratory failure: Multilobar Pneumonia & COPD. Possible that she
   has some sort of endobronchial lesion (? malignancy given smoking hx)
   contributing.  In any case, because of her very severe baseline
   obstructive disease, she remains a very tenuous respiratory place right
   now.  She now requires PEEP of 10 for adequate O2.  CXR unchanged. GPCs
   in pairs, Legionella (-)

   - methylprednisolone to 125 mg q8h
   - fluticasone inh
   - albuterol nebs ,decrease to q4h

   -continue vent; trial of PSV
   - try to diurese if pressors are weaned
   .
   # PNA:  GPCs in pairs, Legionella (-) in sputum, other cx negative.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin for broad bacterial
   coverage including atypical pathogens.
   - redose abx renally per pharmacy
   - plan to reconsider abx tomorrow when sputum speciation returns
   - consider bronch prior to extubation if stabilizes tomorrow
   #. Shock:  Pressor requirement lessening.  Septic from PNA,
   leukocytosis, requiring pressors but is fluid responsive.  No recent
   abx exposure.
   - Abx as above
   - Norepi as needed to keep MAP >60, allow for sedation
   - LOS 6 L positive; plan to avoid excessive IVF unless UOP falls (and
   diurese if off pressors)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe COPD and pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and pneumonia may lead to worsening respiratory failure, requiring increased ventilatory support or mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: As the patient is diagnosed with sepsis, there is a risk of progression to severe sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
3. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient currently does not have organ dysfunction, sepsis can lead to organ failure if not promptly treated.
4. Infection control: Due to the presence of pneumonia and potential for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), measures should be taken to prevent and manage any infections.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate a kidney injury, which requires close monitoring and appropriate management.
6. Hypotension and shock: The patient's requirement for pressors suggests hypotension, and there is a risk of developing shock if not managed appropriately.
7. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension needs to be considered while managing her condition, especially during the use of pressors.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU, there is a risk of developing D"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with pneumonia and COPD exacerbation requiring admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). 

Key findings and potential medical complications include:
1. Respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia and acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. There is poor air movement and diffuse expiratory wheezes.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction, possibly secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin.
3. Chronic kidney injury, evidenced by an elevated creatinine level of 1.1. The patient has received significant fluid hydration, leading to improvement.
4. Hypertension, which has been recently hypotensive on pressors but is now normotensive. Antihypertensive medications have been held.
5. Hypernatremia with a free water deficit of about 4L. The patient is receiving 250 cc free water boluses every 4 hours.
6. The patient has a history of COPD, pneumonia, and bronchitis. She is obese, with"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo w/ prior smoker w/ severe COPD on home O2 admitted w/ resp
   failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
   1. Resp failure- severe COPD exac due to pneumonia. Prior partial RUL
   collapse from [**5-4**] will need further evaluation down the road and might
   have predisposed to current pna. desat yest w/ poss aspiration? will
   have to monitor for infxn but so far clinically defervescing and no new
   infiltrate
   -will have asymmetric lung physiology as L lung is emphysematous and R
   lung is infected, so will need to be cautious of L lung volu- and
   [**Doctor Last Name **]-trauma
   -wean FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60
   -tolerate autoPEEP for now as Pplat < 30 and hemodyn stable
   -assess spont breathing tolerance today but caution on weaning
   -start aggressive diuresis w/ goal -1-2L neg today; will check pm lytes
   -vanco + cefepime + azithro (change to IV) for now --> plan for empiric
   8d course pending cx data
   -tx COPD exac w/ Solu-Medrol --> cont 125 q8 today and scheduled nebs;
   wean steroids tomorrow
   -will need CT scan at some point to re-evaluate, poss bronch
   2.  Shock- resolved, likely multifactorial, sepsis vs meds
   -recent echo [**10-4**] w/ nl EF
   3. HyperNa- monitor w/ diuresis; may need need free H2O boluses
   4. Possible aspiration- has not had BM since admit; constipation might
   be contributing
   -replace OGT
   -aggressive bowel regimen w/ Dulcolax and PO Narcan; hold on enteral
   feee H20 and tube feeds till bowels are moving

   collapse from [**5-4**] will need further evaluation down the road and might
   have predisposed to current pna. desat yest w/ poss aspiration? will
   have to monitor for infxn but so far clinically defervescing and no new
   infiltrate
   -will have asymmetric lung physiology as L lung is emphysematous and R
   lung is infected, so will need to be cautious of L lung volu- and
   [**Doctor Last Name **]-trauma
   -wean FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60
   -tolerate autoPEEP for now as Pplat < 30 and hemodyn stable
   -assess spont breathing tolerance today but caution on weaning
   -start aggressive diuresis w/ goal -1-2L neg today; will check pm lytes
   -vanco + cefepime + azithro (change to IV) for now --> plan for empiric
   8d course pending cx data
   -tx COPD exac w/ Solu-Medrol --> cont 125 q8 today and scheduled nebs;
   wean steroids tomorrow
   -will need CT scan at some point to re-evaluate, poss bronch
   2.  Shock- resolved, likely multifactorial, sepsis vs meds
   -recent echo [**10-4**] w/ nl EF

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of severe COPD and prior smoking, who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The primary medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation and pneumonia put him at high risk for respiratory failure. The goal is to wean FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60, tolerate autoPEEP for now, assess spontaneous breathing tolerance today, and start aggressive diuresis with a goal of -1-2L negative today.

2. Shock: The patient experienced resolved shock, which was likely multifactorial, possibly due to sepsis or medications. Monitoring for signs of recurrent shock is essential.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be monitored with diuresis and may require free water boluses.

4. Possible aspiration: The patient may have aspirated, as indicated by suctioning tube feed-like material from the endotracheal tube. This increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The plan is to replace oral gastrointestinal tube, initiate an aggressive bowel regimen, and hold enteral feeds until bowel movements resume.

5. Constipation: The patient might be experiencing constipation, which can contribute to possible aspiration. It is important to manage this issue promptly.

6. Infection: The patient has G"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe COPD, on home oxygen, who presented with pneumonia and COPD exacerbation requiring MICU admission. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, kidney injury, hypernatremia, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. She is being treated with antibiotics, diuretics, bronchodilators, and steroids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to COPD and acute exacerbation caused by pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic inflammatory response due to infection. This can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially septic shock.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is a high concentration of sodium in the blood. This can cause dehydration and neurological symptoms.
4. Constipation: The patient is constipated, which can increase the risk of bowel ischemia and impaction.
5. Kidney Injury: The patient has an improved kidney injury but still requires monitoring and management to prevent further renal dysfunction.
6. Shock: The patient previously had shock but has been resolved with treatment.
7. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a risk of progression or development of antibiotic-resistant organisms.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. The patient has allergies to penicillins and is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, furosemide, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs show a stable heart rate within normal range (77 bpm), blood pressure slightly elevated but within acceptable limits (138/69 mmHg), respiratory rate within normal range (17 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation at 94%, and temperature within normal range (36.8°C or 98.3°F).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory issues. The flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and input/output measurements. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with set volume (Vt) of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Plateau) of 25 cmH2O, and compliance of 30 cmH2O/mL. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 56 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 95.

The physical examination is incomplete due to the patient's inability to assess certain parameters such as peripheral vascular status, skin, neurologic responses"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. She presents with pneumonia and COPD exacerbation requiring medical intensive care unit (MICU) admission. The patient has respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia and COPD, likely volume overload, and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) requirement increasing. She also has hypernatremia, constipation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and chronic kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilation support are necessary.
2. Volume Overload: The patient may have volume overload, as indicated by a net positive fluid balance of 2.5 liters for the day. This can contribute to respiratory distress and worsen pulmonary edema. Diuretic therapy with furosemide and adjusting ventilator settings may be required.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a high serum sodium level. Free water deficit is approximately 4 liters. Hydration with D5W and free water boluses is necessary to correct the hypernatremia.
4. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which may be exacerbated by immobilization and medication use"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with severe COPD who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. The patient has undergone several events, including an air leak on the ventilator that required changing the endotracheal tube. She denies pain and is not sedated. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 117/89 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications as per the plan. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals no significant changes in the chest X-ray, while microbiology shows yeast and gram-positive cocci in pairs from sputum. The assessment includes respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbation with ARDS, shock (possibly multifactorial), hypernatremia, and constipation. The plan includes aggressive diuresis, weaning of FiO2, and continuation of antibiotics. A CT scan is planned at some point to re-evaluate the right upper lobe collapse seen previously.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation with ARDS puts her at risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adherence to the ARDSnet ventilation strategy will be crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen who presented with pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation requiring medical intensive care unit (MICU) admission. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has developed hypernatremia, constipation, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she requires ongoing management and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to her underlying COPD and the presence of pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to adjust ventilator settings and provide adequate respiratory support.

2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is necessary to identify any signs of worsening sepsis or organ dysfunction. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics is crucial.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is characterized by elevated sodium levels in the blood. This condition can lead to neurological complications if not corrected promptly. Close monitoring of serum sodium levels and careful fluid management are required to restore normal sodium balance.

4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and previous pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She remains intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia and COPD exacerbation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic hypernatremia, constipation, and kidney injury.

The patient has received various treatments including antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin), diuretics (furosemide), sedatives (midazolam), pain medication (fentanyl), and antacids (pantoprazole). She also receives continuous nebulizer treatments and has been given methylprednisolone followed by Flovent puffs.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/59 mmHg to 151/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. Her fluid balance indicates an input of 3,362 mL and output of 4,150 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -788 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (28.5 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (9.7 g"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old prior smoker with severe COPD who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been intubated for five days. Key events include the administration of Lasix last night, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 800cc, and the replacement of the endotracheal tube due to injury and air leak. The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies. Antibiotics were given including cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin. The patient is receiving various medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin, and furosemide. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for the mentioned above. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but they show a slightly low oxygen saturation level of 91%. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and controlled mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 340 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a slightly elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) level. Physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally and a reducible hernia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell"

","The patient is a 67-year-old former smoker with severe COPD who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has received Lasix 80mg IV, which resulted in a negative fluid balance of 800cc. The endotracheal tube (ETT) had to be replaced last night due to injury to the cuff and air leak.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergens. The last doses of antibiotics administered were cefepime at 10:33 AM on 03/30/2192, vancomycin at 08:00 PM on 03/30/2192, and azithromycin at 07:30 AM on 03/31/2192.

The patient is receiving several infusions, including midazolam (Versed) at 6 mg/hour and fentanyl at 200 mcg/hour.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old former smoker with severe COPD on home oxygen who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, pain management, diuretics, and aggressive diuresis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation and pneumonia have led to respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet ventilation, which aims to improve oxygenation and lung protection. The healthcare team needs to carefully monitor the patient's lung function and adjust ventilation settings accordingly.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's current respiratory condition and the presence of pneumonia, there is a risk of developing ARDS. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation parameters, such as PaO2/FiO2 ratio, is essential.

3. Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI): Due to the patient's asymmetric lung physiology, where the left lung is emphysematous and the right lung is infected, there is a risk of VILI. The healthcare team should ensure appropriate ventilation strategies are implemented to minimize lung injury.

4. Fluid Management: The patient has been receiving aggressive diuresis to manage fluid balance. Close monitoring of fluid status and electrolyte levels is crucial to avoid complications related to fluid overload or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old former smoker with severe COPD who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
- The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergens.
- The patient received various medications including cefipime, vancomycin, azithromycin, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin, and furosemide.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/59mmHg to 146/89mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 340 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 56 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 71 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 34%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 4.5 mEq/L.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 28.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.2%, platelet count (Plt) of 446, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 29 mmHg, and blood glucose levels ranging from 149 to 150 mg/dL.
- Other lab values include prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low albumin, normal electrolyte levels, and low magnesium (Mg++) level.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows new infiltrates in the right lower lobe.
- The patient is expected to stay in the ICU for an extended period of time.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is immobile and has risk factors such as severe COPD and recent surgery, which increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
3. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive devices increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
4. Barotrauma: The patient's high plateau pressure and PEEP may increase the risk of barotrauma to the lungs.
5. Acidosis: The patient's ABG shows a slightly low pH, indicating the possibility of developing acidosis.
6. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation and high FiO2 requirements indicate a risk of persistent hypoxemia.
7. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a negative balance, indicating a potential risk of dehydration.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently elevated, which may indicate the need for closer monitoring and management of blood sugar levels.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status"

","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 103/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on 50% FiO2. She is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 340 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 27 cmH2O.

The patient has trace bilateral pitting edema, improving, and prominent bowel sounds. Her abdominal examination reveals a well-healed scar on the right side of the umbilicus, obesity, softness, and tenderness. Her cardiac examination shows a distant regular heart sound without murmurs. Her chest examination reveals poor air movement, expiratory wheezes diffusely, and difficulty auscultating under breath sounds.

The patient's laboratory results indicate hyponatremia (low sodium), elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit and platelet count, normal creatinine and glucose levels, and altered liver function tests. Her arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 68 mmHg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe COPD, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and other medical conditions. She has been intubated and sedated since admission. The patient continues to have respiratory failure with difficulty in oxygenating without high PEEP/FiO2. She requires PEEP of 14 cmH2O. The patient has been on Lasix gtt to promote diuresis, but she is still net positive for fluid balance. Her sodium levels are high, and she has hypernatremia. The patient also has constipation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation. She is being treated with multiple antibiotics, steroids, bronchodilators, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with ongoing difficulty in oxygenation. There is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient is septic without organ dysfunction, and there is a potential risk of progression to severe sepsis or septic shock.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be managed carefully to avoid complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological disturbances.
4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing obstipation, which can lead to complications like fecal impaction, perforation, or infection if not managed appropriately"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is complicated by hypernatremia (high sodium levels), constipation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and chronic respiratory failure. He is receiving various medications including furosemide, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and others. The patient is being closely monitored with hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and multiple lab tests.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory condition may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress or failure.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently without organ dysfunction, there is a risk of progression to severe sepsis or septic shock if infection spreads or becomes more widespread.
3. Hypernatremia: The high sodium levels can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially neurological complications if not properly managed.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation could progress to obstipation (complete cessation of bowel movements), increasing the risk of complications such as fecal impaction or perforation.
5. ICU-acquired infections: Prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of severe COPD and prior smoking, who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by asymmetric lung physiology, with the left lung being emphysematous and the right lung being infected. There is a concern for lung volume trauma in the left lung.

The patient has shown improvement in respiratory failure, but still requires FiO2 supplementation to maintain PaO2 above 60. PEEP has been increased to 12 cmH2O. Aggressive diuresis is being continued with a goal of -1 to -2 liters negative fluid balance today. Lasix infusion has been changed to a low rate for slow continuous diuresis.

The patient's antibiotic regimen has been changed to vancomycin and cefepime due to concern for resistant organisms. Solu-Medrol has been added for treatment of COPD exacerbation, but will be transitioned to oral prednisone once the patient is weaned off sedation. A CT scan is planned to re-evaluate the patient's condition and possibly perform a bronchoscopic evaluation of the right upper lobe collapse seen on previous imaging.

The patient also had a brief episode of shock, which has resolved and was likely multifactorial, possibly related to sepsis or medication effects. An echoc"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old former smoker with severe COPD who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been intubated for 5 days and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure and heart rate, but within normal limits. The patient's urine output has been good on Lasix, but only negative 500cc. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. The patient is improving slowly, but there is still a need to wean FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60 and increase PEEP to 12 since O2 saturation is on the low side.

2. Shock: The patient had shock, which has now resolved, likely due to multifactorial causes such as sepsis or medications. A recent echo showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which has improved. It is recommended to decrease free H2O boluses and continue diuresis.

4. Constipation: The patient had constipation, which is resolving. An aggressive regimen for constipation management should be continued.

Overall, the patient's condition is"

","The patient is a 67-year-old prior smoker with severe COPD on home oxygen admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. The patient has been intubated for 5 days. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/54 to 131/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 68 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 142, and Ve of 7.7 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are intubated and lightly sedated but can awaken to voice and nod yes/no. There are no murmurs or gallops heard on cardiovascular examination. Pulmonary examination shows clear to auscultation bilaterally. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender. Extremities show no rashes or clubbing, and neurologic examination reveals that the patient is sedated but able to answer questions.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 28.5 K/uL, Hct of 30.2%, Plt of 446, Cr of 0.9 mg/dL, TCO2 of 33, glucose levels ranging from 133 to 194 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits. Chest X-ray shows continued failure with fluid in fissure on the right, but pneumonia substantially improved from the film on [**3-27**].

The patient's assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbation with ARDS, now improving slowly. Weaning FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 60, increasing PEEP to 12 since O2 saturation is on the low side. Continuing aggressive diuresis with a goal of -1-2L negative today, and checking post-laser electrolytes. Continuing lasix gtt (low rate) for slow continuous diuresis. Vanco + cefepime + azithro --> plan for empiric 8-day course pending CX data. Prednisone 40mg daily pNGT. Will decrease to 30mg in 2 days. Flovent.
2. Shock resolved, likely multifactorial, sepsis vs. meds. Recent echo [**10-4**] with normal ejection fraction.
3. HyperNa improved. Decreasing free H2O boluses, continue diuresis.
4. Constipation resolving. Continue aggressive regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and is currently on multiple medications including furosemide, fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/54 to 131/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid administration and blood product transfusions. The patient's urine output is within normal limits, but there is a slight imbalance in fluid intake and output. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation set at a tidal volume of 340 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 142, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 71.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable except for the presence of an arterial line and multi"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She continues to be intubated and sedated. The patient's oxygenation has been difficult, requiring high levels of FiO2 and PEEP. Despite fluid restriction, she remains net positive for fluid balance. Her blood pressure was previously hypotensive but has now stabilized. Laboratory results show elevated sodium levels and signs of kidney injury, which have improved with fluid hydration. The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating. She is currently on multiple antibiotics for suspected sepsis and has a history of hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia have led to acute respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The patient is being treated for suspected sepsis with a combination of antibiotics. There is a potential for progression to septic shock if infection is not adequately controlled.
3. Kidney Injury: The patient's initial elevated creatinine levels indicate kidney injury. Continued monitoring is required to assess renal function and prevent further deterioration.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia. Care must be taken to manage fluid balance and electrolyte levels to avoid complications associated with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-inch tall individual with a weight of 180 pounds. They are currently admitted to the ICU for various medical conditions.

The patient has been experiencing difficulty with oxygenation throughout the day, requiring increased FiO2 from 50% to 70%. The chest X-ray remains unchanged. The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative fluid intake of approximately 1.5 liters over the past 24 hours, with ongoing lasix infusion at a rate of 10 gtt. However, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 90/60 mmHg, prompting the discontinuation of lasix. Despite this, the patient is still experiencing negative fluid balance.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/59 to 90/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their height and weight are within normal ranges.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (VT) of 412 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 26 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (AB"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. She continues to be intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient has been experiencing difficulty with oxygenation, requiring higher levels of FiO2. Her fluid balance is negative, indicating ongoing fluid losses. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume (Vt) of 412 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 26 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct) levels. The patient's sodium level is high, indicating hypernatremia. Other lab values are within normal range.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may require careful management.
2. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation, and a laxative (FOS) should be considered.
3. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient's underlying COPD has led to acute exacerbation and respiratory failure. She requires continued respiratory support.
4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient experienced difficulty with oxygenation in the afternoon, requiring an increase in the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) from 50% to 70%. She also had decreased fluid removal with furosemide (Lasix) boluses, indicating ongoing fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure (hypotension) at 90/60 mmHg, likely due to her recent shock state, which has resolved. Her respiratory support consists of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 26 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and a FiO2 of 50%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory acidosis with compensated respiratory alkalosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals general signs of being intubated and sedated but easily arousable. There are very poor air movements, expiratory wheezes, and distant heart sounds. The abdomen is soft, nontender, and obese with prominent bowel sounds. Trace bilateral pitting edema is present, which is improving.

Laboratory results show hypernatremia (high sodium), elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count within normal range. Other lab values such as creatinine, total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are mostly within normal limits.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and constipation. The assessment plan includes continuing respiratory support, managing hypernatremia, addressing constipation, and weaning off sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include further deterioration of respiratory function, worsening hypernatremia, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential kidney injury due to fluid overload and sepsis.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, requiring close monitoring and management of her respiratory, electrolyte, and kidney functions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. She has been receiving diuretics for fluid overload to optimize ventilation. The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies. She has been receiving antibiotics (cefipime, vancomycin, and azithromycin) as per the ICU protocol. The patient is on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/53 mmHg to 129/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. She is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 343 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 27 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient has evidence of right and left lower extremity edema. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and normal creatinine levels. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation put her at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to further pulmonary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and previous acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's main concerns include respiratory failure, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), constipation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require high levels of oxygen and positive airway pressure support. This indicates ongoing difficulty in oxygenating the blood and maintaining adequate breathing. The presence of multilobar pneumonia and ARDS suggests a high risk of further respiratory deterioration.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to various complications such as dehydration, altered mental status, seizures, and kidney dysfunction.

3. Constipation: The patient is experiencing obstipation (difficulty passing stool), which may increase the risk of fecal impaction and subsequent bowel ischemia or perforation.

4. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently without organ dysfunction, the presence of sepsis indicates an ongoing infection. If not promptly treated, it can progress to septic shock and multiple organ failure.

5. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD is worsening, leading to increased symptoms and impaired lung function. This puts the patient at higher risk for respiratory"

","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. She has been experiencing respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia and COPD exacerbation, requiring high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's sodium levels are high, and she is also dealing with constipation. Her sepsis without organ dysfunction is being managed with appropriate antibiotics. The patient's kidney injury has improved with significant fluid hydration, and her creatinine levels are now within normal range. Her blood pressure has stabilized, and antihypertensive medications have been held. The patient's nutritional status is being addressed through repletion with fiber, and she is receiving tube feeds. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) care. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with severe COPD who was admitted with respiratory failure due to ARDS from pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her lung function is being supported with a ventilator set at a tidal volume of 350 mL and a respiratory system compliance of 38.9 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (24.5 K/uL), hemoglobin level (9.3 g/dL), and platelet count (557 K/uL). Her blood glucose levels are within normal range, but she has slightly elevated levels of lactate (1.2 mmol/L), creatinine (0.9 mg/dL), and potassium (4.2 mEq/L). The imaging reveals a worsened right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include continuing ARDSnet ventilation, weaning FiO2 and PEEP to maintain PaO2 > 60, aggressive diuresis with a goal of -1-2L negative fluid balance today, and checking post-diuretic electrolytes. The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old former smoker with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen who was admitted with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet ventilation, aggressive diuresis, and azetazolamide for HCO3 wasting in contraction alkalosis. Antibiotics have been completed, and steroid weaning is being planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient already has severe respiratory failure due to ARDS, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for increased ventilatory support or other interventions.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls are being implemented to reduce this risk.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to immobility and prolonged bed rest, the patient is at risk for developing DVT. Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin has been started to reduce this risk.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged mechanical ventilation. A proton pump inhibitor has been initiated for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet indicates an overall positive balance"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She continues to be intubated and sedated. The patient has respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation. She requires high PEEP/FiO2 to oxygenate and is still significantly positive for fluid balance with a loss of 4.5 liters. An ultrasound was performed today to evaluate for effusion, which may contribute to the fluid balance issue. The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia (high sodium), constipation, and kidney injury. She has an improved creatinine level of 0.9 and is no longer in shock, as her blood pressure is now normotensive. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications. She has multiple lines, including an arterial line, and is receiving nutrition and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and ARDS, persistent fluid imbalance leading to electrolyte disturbances, constipation, kidney injury, and sepsis. The patient's high sodium levels indicate hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with severe COPD and a history of smoking. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with assisted spontaneous breathing, receiving 50% oxygen, and has a PEEP level of 10 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate between 60-79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/53-108/75 mmHg, respiratory rate at 16-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, midazolam, and heparin sodium. She is also on pantoprazole, Atrovent, Peridex, RISS, Albuterol PRN, Narcan PO, Flovent, Lasix gtt, Diamox, and Prednisone 30 qd. The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged from admission, except for the addition of pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except as noted below.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of +2,898 mL total in, with 1,168 mL via PO, 1,050 mL via IVF, and 953 mL via tube feeding. Total out is 4,550 mL, including 1,330 mL of urine output. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 350 mL, RR set at 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 91%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 68, HCO3 of 57, SaO2 of 49%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 114. The patient's blood gases also show a ventilation efficiency (Ve) of 7.8 L/min.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with the patient being overweight and obese. Her eyes, head, ears, nose, and throat are within normal limits. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral vascular examination reveals no assessed pulses. Respiratory/chest examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally. Abdominal examination indicates a soft abdomen with non-tender findings. Extremities show no edema. Neurologic examination reveals the patient follows simple commands, responds to stimuli, and demonstrates sedation with no assessed movement or tone.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 24.5-24.7 thousand cells/mm3, hematocrit of 30"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. She has been on mechanical ventilation for 9 days due to multilobar pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her arterial line stopped at 4:18 AM, and she experienced increasing carbon dioxide levels despite decreasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Her blood pressure is borderline, and she required a decrease in lasix gtt due to this. The arterial line was also lost.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies. She received antibiotics including azithromycin, vancomycin, and cefepime. She is currently on several infusions such as furosemide (lasix), midazolam (versed), and fentanyl. She also receives pantoprazole (protonix) and heparin sodium prophylactically.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 90/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and plateau pressure of 11 cmH2O.

Her physical examination reveals that she is intubated and sedated but easily arousable and following commands. Her chest sounds reveal poor air movement and expiratory wheezes diffusely. Her cardiac examination shows distant heart sounds without murmurs. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and obese with prominent bowel sounds. She has trace bilateral pitting edema, which is improving.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (24.7), slightly low hemoglobin (9.7 g/dL), elevated blood urea nitrogen (115 mg/dL), and creatinine (1.1 mg/dL). Her electrolytes show hypernatremia (high sodium level) and hypokalemia (low potassium level). Other labs are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypernatremia, constipation, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. She continues to be intubated and sedated. The team plans to continue lasix gtt, perform daily lab tests including electrolytes, continue acetazolamide, and continue prednisone. They will also continue the current antibiotics for another 8 days.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, atelectasis, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent and minimize these complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old prior smoker with severe COPD on home oxygen who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. The patient has been intubated for 10 days and is currently on assisted ventilation with a tidal volume of 6cc/kg and permissive hypercapnia. The goal is to maintain a PaO2 of greater than 60 while weaning FiO2 and PEEP. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's blood glucose level is 115 mg/dL, white blood cell count is 21.5 K/uL, hematocrit is 29.3%, platelet count is 432, creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, and sodium level is 143 mEq/L.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation and pneumonia have led to respiratory failure. There is a risk of continued respiratory compromise if the patient does not respond to current treatment measures.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures are in place to prevent VAP, including elev"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe COPD and pneumonia. She has been intubated and sedated for the past 10 days due to respiratory failure caused by multilobar pneumonia and acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient continues to have difficulty oxygenating without high PEEP/FiO2.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there is a concern about her ability to oxygenate without high PEEP/FiO2. This indicates a risk of continued respiratory distress and potential worsening of her condition.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which means she has high levels of sodium in her blood. This can lead to dehydration and neurological complications if not properly managed.

3. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to her limited mobility and possible medication use. This can increase the risk of bowel obstruction and other gastrointestinal complications.

4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: Although the patient's sepsis is currently without organ dysfunction, it is important to monitor for any signs of deterioration or progression to septic shock.

5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: The patient has an acute exacerbation of COPD, which can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multilobar pneumonia, and acute exacerbation of COPD. She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since day 10 due to respiratory failure. She has been treated for pneumonia but still has difficulty oxygenating without high PEEP/FiO2. The patient has been given diuretics to manage her fluid balance, and there is a plan to wean PEEP as tolerated. She is also being given lasix, acetazolamide, and prednisone. The patient's blood work shows elevated sodium levels, constipation, and an increased white blood cell count. The assessment includes hypernatremia, constipation, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute exacerbation of COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty in oxygenating without high PEEP/FiO2 indicates ongoing respiratory distress. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: Although the patient has been treated for pneumonia, the elevated white blood cell count suggests ongoing infection. If sepsis progresses, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels need"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old with respiratory failure, COPD, and MRSA PNA. They are currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been weaned down to PEEP of 8 and their FiO2 is set at 50%. Their current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 89/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and an incarcerated hernia. They are receiving multiple medications including furosemide, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and others. Their lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's agitation is being managed with medication drips and boluses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular chest X-rays may be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and presence of lower extremity edema increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe COPD, who continues to be intubated and sedated. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode with a set tidal volume of 350 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her blood pressure is within normal range, heart rate is stable, respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation is 90%. The patient has been diagnosed with hypernatremia (high sodium levels), respiratory failure due to chronic COPD with acute exacerbation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. Kidney function appears to be normal, but liver function tests are slightly abnormal. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with high sodium and low potassium levels.

The assessment and plan include addressing the patient's hypernatremia, constipation, respiratory failure, sepsis, and chronic COPD with acute exacerbation. The healthcare team is considering the possibility of extubation today or tomorrow, but if unsuccessful, a tracheostomy may be necessary. The patient will continue with acetazolamide and prednisone therapy, and diuretics will be continued as well. Other plans include administering PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis, heparin for deep vein thrombosis prevention"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe COPD, who is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. She has been on mechanical ventilation for 11 days due to multilobar pneumonia and ARDS. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/67 to 143/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient has been diuresed with 2 liters negative yesterday and continues to be somewhat negative today.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by multilobar pneumonia and ARDS. There is a possibility of attempting extubation today or tomorrow. If extubation fails, a tracheostomy may be needed.
2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has hypernatremia, which requires further evaluation and management.
3. Constipation (Obstipation, FOS): The patient is at risk for constipation, and a bowel regimen has been initiated.
4. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has sepsis secondary to multilobar pneumonia, but without organ dysfunction.
5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has severe COPD with an acute exacerbation.
6. Chronic Respiratory Failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, and other medical conditions. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and required prolonged intubation. She is now extubated but continues to experience respiratory difficulties. Her vital signs show elevated blood pressure, normal heart rate, slightly elevated respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. She has been prescribed benzodiazepines for anxiety, and BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) is being used as needed. She also has metabolic alkalosis, which is improving, and a history of pneumonia that has been treated with antibiotics. Other medical issues include hypernatremia, constipation, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and recent ARDS increases the risk of respiratory failure. Since she is experiencing tachypnea and anxiety after extubation, close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support are necessary.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient has received a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is still a risk of complications related to pneumonia, such as worsening lung infection or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis secondary to aggressive diuresis. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and adjusting diuretic therapy will be important to manage"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-inch tall, 90.1 kg individual currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute exacerbation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypernatremia, constipation, and obesity. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate 89 bpm, blood pressure 160/88 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 93% on high flow nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. 

The patient has been extubated to bipap after being intubated and was comfortable on it initially. However, the patient stated feeling uncomfortable and was taken off bipap for six hours. During this time, the patient's oxygen saturation remained stable, but the respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute. The arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.43, PaCO2 53 mmHg, and PaO2 294. The patient was then put back on bipap for a short period before being placed on a face tent.

The patient is receiving continuous infusion of furosemide (Lasix) at 3 mg/hour and has been making approximately 150 cc/hour urine. 

The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated but is now extubated. The patient has been experiencing agitation and restlessness, which resolved after receiving diazepam for suspected benzodiazepine withdrawal. She also has a history of hypertension and constipation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 152/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula. She is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, lorazepam, diazepam, and heparin sodium. Laboratory results show hypernatremia and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory alkalosis and ongoing metabolic alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to severe COPD. Her recent ABG values suggest respiratory alkalosis on top of ongoing metabolic alkalosis from hyperventilation. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was previously intubated but is now extubated. 

The patient's vital signs show that she has a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 152/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Her laboratory results indicate hypernatremia (high sodium level), elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal kidney function. Other lab values such as blood glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and albumin are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, pneumonia, metabolic alkalosis, hypertension, and is at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and pressure ulcers.

The plan of care includes monitoring the patient closely, providing benzodiazepine for anxiety, using BiPAP as needed, continuing diuretics for pulmonary edema, and ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte balance. The patient is also being fed through a feeding tube and receiving appropriate medications for her conditions"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was recently extubated after prolonged intubation and is now experiencing respiratory failure with tachypnea. Her most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results show respiratory alkalosis on top of ongoing metabolic alkalosis from hyperventilation. The patient has been prescribed benzodiazepines for anxiety and possible withdrawal, as well as bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for respiratory support. She will continue to receive supplemental oxygen to maintain a goal SpO2 of 88-92%. The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative daily output, indicating potential dehydration. Her metabolic alkalosis is secondary to aggressive diuresis, which is improving. The patient also has a history of hypertension and is on medication for it. She has hypernatremia, for which she is encouraged to drink oral water and continue monitoring. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through intravenous fluids (IVF) with planned advancement of her diet as tolerated. She is also on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for her gastrointestinal health and has been prescribed heparin for thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient's central venous and arterial lines will be managed accordingly. She has a full code status and emergency contact information. The patient's ICU consent and disposition are documented."

The patient has a history of right-sided pneumonia and ARDS/respiratory failure. She is currently receiving various medications, including lorazepam, diazepam, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, blood pressure ranging from 127/79 to 169/96 mmHg, heart rate between 95 and 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows normal values, and her fluid balance is within acceptable limits. The patient's weight has decreased from 100.9 kg at admission to 90.1 kg currently. The patient is able to follow simple commands and is attentive. Her breath sounds are clear, but crackles are heard on the right basal area. There is no evidence of edema in her extremities. The patient's laboratory results indicate normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and other parameters. Imaging shows a resolving right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and previous pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated but is now extubated and on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. Her respiratory status remains stable, but she continues to require supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation levels between 88-92%. BIPAP will be continued overnight.

She is still receiving a prednisone taper, which will be reduced to 10mg daily today for three days before tapering off. She will continue taking albuterol and fluticasone, and incentive spirometry will be encouraged. Prior to discharge, she should be switched to Spiriva and off of atrovent.

The patient also has a history of pneumonia, for which she has already received a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

In terms of her blood pressure, she has a history of hypertension, but her current blood pressure readings are running low normal. As a result, she will discontinue her antihypertensive medications, except for having only received one dose of captopril due to low normal blood pressures.

She has resolved hypernatremia with intravenous fluids and free water intake. Her hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 33% to 28% today, indicating anemia. No source of bleeding has been identified. She will continue taking home proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and her condition will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe COPD and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been extubated after prolonged intubation and remains stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. Her current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate at 70 bpm (59-99 bpm), blood pressure at 91/54 mmHg (79-118/77 mmHg), respiratory rate at 20 breaths per minute (17-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's weight is currently 90.1 kg, and her height is 67 inches.

Laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 22.7 thousand/mm3 (19.2-16.9 thousand/mm3)
- Hematocrit: 32.9% (33.4-28.4%)
- Platelet count: 465 thousand/mm3 (446-415 thousand/mm3)
- Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL (0.9-1.0 mg/dL)
- Total CO2: 39 mmHg (43-39 mmHg)
- Blood glucose: 121 mg/dL (93-127 mg/dL)
- Other labs: PT/PTT/INR within normal range, ALT/AST within normal range, Alk Phos/TBili within normal range, differential showing 90.0% neutrophils, 5.0% lymphocytes, and 3.0% monocytes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been extubated and is stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. She will continue to receive continuous oxygen to maintain saturation levels between 88-92%. BIPAP will be used overnight, and she will be encouraged to use incentive spirometry. The prednisone taper will be reduced to 10 mg daily for three days, then tapered further.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has completed a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is running low normal, so antihypertensives will be discontinued.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have resolved with IV fluid administration and free water intake.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 33% to 28% today. No source of bleeding has been identified. Home PPI will continue, and further evaluation for anemia will be considered.
6. Nutrition: The patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding.
7. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels will"

","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of very severe COPD, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated but is now extubated and on nasal cannula oxygen with a saturation of 93%. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 91/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air.

The patient has decreased urine output, which has been addressed by increasing her intravenous fluid intake. Her fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1452 mL. She has received a total of 2389 mL of fluids since 94 AM, with 1029 mL given through intravenous fluids and 77 mL lost from drains. Her urine output has been 937 mL since 94 AM, with 350 mL lost from the Foley catheter.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (22.7 K/uL), hemoglobin (9.3 g/dL), and platelet count (465 K/uL). Blood glucose levels are within normal range (121 mg/dL), but other lab values such as sodium (142 mEq/L), potassium (3.9 mEq/L), chloride (96 mg/dL), calcium (9.0 mg/dL), magnesium (2.2 mg/dL), and phosphorus (3.6 mg/dL) are within normal limits. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of severe COPD, pneumonia, and ARDS. She has been extubated after prolonged intubation and is currently on 4L NC with continuous O2 to maintain sats at 88-92%. She has been prescribed BIPAP overnight and a prednisone taper. The patient also has hypertension and hypernatremia, which have been managed accordingly. Her Hct has dropped from 33 to 28 today. No source of bleeding has been identified. The patient is on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. 

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains stable on 4L NC, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent any deterioration.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient has received a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is still a risk of pneumonia recurrence or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is running low normal, so it is important to regularly monitor and adjust antihypertensive medications if needed.
4. Anemia: The significant drop in Hct from 33 to 28 suggests anemia, but no source of bleeding has been identified. Further investigation is required to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Fluid balance: Close monitoring of the patient's fluid intake and output is crucial to maintain fluid balance and prevent complications such as"
