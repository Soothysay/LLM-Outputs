   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F s/p fall on [**12-13**] with recent left total hip replacement on
   Aspirin and Lovenox with episode of hematemesis and hematocrit 16 with
   guaiac positive stool.
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: Hct 16.6 down from baseline in low 30s last year.
   Etiologies include GIB given guaiac positive stool, active blood loss
   at surgical site given recent THR, hematemesis. Small concern for
   aorto-enteric fistula as has had in past.  Concern for varicoele bleed,
   gastritis, PUD.
   - GI consult - EGD in unit tonight
   - Continue massive transfusion protocol, hct > 25-28
   - Trend hematocrit q4hr
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Volume resuscitation with blood and fluids
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient indubated semi-electivly for GI procedure.
   Prior she has expressed with to be DNR/DNI.  She agreed to be intubated
   for her EGD.  Currently she is satting well on 50% FiO2 and a PEEP of
   5.  She did appear volume up on CXR after receiving blood products.
   -While in the setting of hypotension and patient is intubated will
   continue to volume replete.  If desats will increase PEEP first then
   FiO2.
   -Once HD stable can gently diurese to wean off vent, but will hold for
   now.
   .
   # s/p left total hip replacement: Recent surgery likely contributing to
   anemia.
   - Follow up surgery recs regarding trauma
   - Currently holding anticoagulation in the setting of GI bleed.  Will
   have to discuss with Orhto what to antcoagulate with given Gi bleed.
   -PT when Extubated.
   .
   # CAD/Chest pain: Signs of demand ischemia on EKG. Will re-assess
   - Continue massive transfusion protocol, hct > 21
   .
   # CHF: EF is 30-35% based on echo in 08.  Likely ischemic.  Currently
   needs fluids and blood.  Intubated and on low PEEP.  If trouble will
   increase PEEP. Hold diuretics for now.
   .
   # A fib: Currently rate controlled.  Will continue to give volume
   overnight.  If tachy likely sign of re-bleeding and will need more
   blood.  Hold on AV nodal agents overnight in setting of hypotension.
   # FEN: IVF bolus, replete electrolytes prn, NPO for procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no subcutaneous heparin [**1-18**] bleed
   # Access: PIVs, cordis
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (need to clarify with family as concern previously about
   DNR/DNI)

   *****
   Acute blood loss anemia with hypotension
 severe UGI bleed, likely
   from bleeding antral ulcers.
   - Transfuse prn, keeping Hct 25-29, check Hct q4h, GI would repeat
   endoscopy
   - Follow coags, platelets, unlikely septic, leukocytosis likely stress
   response.
   Hypotension
 likely from hemorrhage +/- volume depletion. Will give NS
   though has signs of CHF. [**Month (only) 8**] need to increase Peep/FiO2. Doubt need for
   pressors. Would aim to keep MAP >65
   Pt has been DNR but accepted intubation for procedure. Will need to
   clarify code status going forward. If DNR directive is confirmed, would
   not escalate care.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female who presented with a history of recent left total hip replacement and had an episode of hematemesis and a hematocrit level of 16. She also had a positive guaiac test in her stool. The assessment and plan indicate that she has an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely due to a gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), active blood loss at the surgical site, or a potential aorto-enteric fistula. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for acute blood loss anemia with hypotension.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5. She is also on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 450 mL and a respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 21.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 322 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose (Glucose) of 173 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal range.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case. These include:

1. Continued bleeding from the upper GI source, leading to further blood loss and hypotension.
2. Development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to massive transfusion and ongoing bleeding.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to fluid overload and/or pneumonia.
4. Cardiac complications such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure due to hypotension and fluid resuscitation.
5. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further bleeding, organ dysfunction, and infection while in the ICU. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these potential complications will be crucial for her care."

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), anemia possibly due to recent surgery, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30-35%, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and possible femoral head necrosis (FEN). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of CHF if the patient does not improve, re-bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, and further deterioration of renal function due to hypotension and fluid resuscitation. The patient's code status is reported to be DNR/DNI, but there seems to be some confusion regarding this, as the patient agreed to be intubated for the GI procedure. 

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions and complications. It is important to address the gastrointestinal bleeding, optimize cardiac function, manage the patient's coagulation status, and provide appropriate pain control and rehabilitation for her recent hip surgery."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F s/p fall on [**12-13**] with recent left total hip replacement on
   Aspirin and Lovenox with episode of hematemesis and hematocrit 16 with
   guaiac positive stool.
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: Hct 16.6 down from baseline in low 30s last year.
   Etiologies include GIB given guaiac positive stool, active blood loss
   at surgical site given recent THR, hematemesis. Small concern for
   aorto-enteric fistula as has had in past.  Concern for varicoele bleed,
   gastritis, PUD.
   - GI consult - EGD in unit tonight
   - Continue massive transfusion protocol, hct > 25-28
   - Trend hematocrit q4hr
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Volume resuscitation with blood and fluids
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient indubated semi-electivly for GI procedure.
   Prior she has expressed with to be DNR/DNI.  She agreed to be intubated
   for her EGD.  Currently she is satting well on 50% FiO2 and a PEEP of
   5.  She did appear volume up on CXR after receiving blood products.
   -While in the setting of hypotension and patient is intubated will
   continue to volume replete.  If desats will increase PEEP first then
   FiO2.
   -Once HD stable can gently diurese to wean off vent, but will hold for
   now.
   .
   # s/p left total hip replacement: Recent surgery likely contributing to
   anemia.
   - Follow up surgery recs regarding trauma
   - Currently holding anticoagulation in the setting of GI bleed.  Will
   have to discuss with Orhto what to antcoagulate with given Gi bleed.
   -PT when Extubated.
   .
   # CAD/Chest pain: Signs of demand ischemia on EKG. Will re-assess
   - Continue massive transfusion protocol, hct > 21
   .
   # CHF: EF is 30-35% based on echo in 08.  Likely ischemic.  Currently
   needs fluids and blood.  Intubated and on low PEEP.  If trouble will
   increase PEEP. Hold diuretics for now.
   .
   # A fib: Currently rate controlled.  Will continue to give volume
   overnight.  If tachy likely sign of re-bleeding and will need more
   blood.  Hold on AV nodal agents overnight in setting of hypotension.
   # FEN: IVF bolus, replete electrolytes prn, NPO for procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no subcutaneous heparin [**1-18**] bleed
   # Access: PIVs, cordis
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (need to clarify with family as concern previously about
   DNR/DNI)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
   *****
   Acute blood loss anemia with hypotension
 severe UGI bleed, likely
   from bleeding antral ulcers.
   - Transfuse prn, keeping Hct 25-29, check Hct q4h, GI would repeat
   endoscopy
   - Follow coags, platelets, unlikely septic, leukocytosis likely stress
   response.
   Hypotension
 likely from hemorrhage +/- volume depletion. Will give NS
   though has signs of CHF. [**Month (only) 8**] need to increase Peep/FiO2. Doubt need for
   pressors. Would aim to keep MAP >65
   Pt has been DNR but accepted intubation for procedure. Will need to
   clarify code status going forward. If DNR directive is confirmed, would
   not escalate care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female who recently underwent a left total hip replacement. She presented with an episode of hematemesis and was found to have a hematocrit of 16, indicating significant blood loss. The patient has a history of falls and has been on aspirin and Lovenox for her recent surgery. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted blood loss.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and an elevated heart rate. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and an FiO2 of 50%. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, low platelet count, elevated white blood cell count, and altered coagulation parameters. Her blood glucose level is also elevated at 173 mg/dL.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), acute blood loss anemia, respiratory distress, recent total hip replacement, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure (CHF).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the UGIB, leading to further blood loss and hypotension.
2. Development of sepsis due to stress ulcers or other infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F s/p fall on [**12-13**] with recent left total hip replacement on
   Aspirin and Lovenox with episode of hematemesis and hematocrit 16 with
   guaiac positive stool and GI EGD with non-bleeding ulcerations in
   antrum and clots.
   # Upper GI bleed: Hct 16.6 down from baseline in low 30s last year.
   Etiologies include GIB given guaiac positive stool, active blood loss
   at surgical site given recent THR, hematemesis. Negative CT abdomen
   decreases likelihood of concern for aorto-enteric fistula as has had in
   past.  Concern for varicoele bleed, gastritis, PUD. BP measurements
   different on right and left; presume that left a-line with chronic
   vascular flow issues as patient otherwise shows signs of good hydration
   including not tachycardic and with good UOP
   - Appreciate GI recommendations; will continue to follow, continue
   serial hematocrit
   - Continue transfusion hct goal > 25
   - Continue to trend hematocrit q4hr
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Continue to assess BPs on right vs left and volume resuscitation with
   blood/fluid based on clinical status, MAP >65
   # Respiratory: Patient intubated semi-electively for GI procedure.
   Prior she has expressed wish to be DNR/DNI.  She agreed to be intubated
   for her EGD.  Currently she is saturating well on 50% FiO2 and a PEEP
   of 5.  She did appear volume up on CXR after receiving blood products.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial
   - Trial 0/0 for extended period prior to extubation attempt; change to
   PSV
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   # s/p left total hip replacement: Recent surgery likely contributing to
   anemia.
   - Follow up surgery recs regarding trauma
   - Consider getting in touch with OSH ortho with anticoagulation
   recommendations; we will, however, plan to hold anticoagulation given
   GI bleed
   # CAD/Chest pain: Signs of demand ischemia on EKG. Anticipate will
   improve given resuscitation.
   - Check repeat EKG
   # CHF: EF is 30-35% based on echo in
08.  Likely ischemic.  Currently
   needs fluids and blood.  Intubated and on low PEEP.  If trouble will

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F s/p fall on [**12-13**] with recent left total hip replacement on
   Aspirin and Lovenox with episode of hematemesis and hematocrit 16 with
   guaiac positive stool and GI EGD with non-bleeding ulcerations in
   antrum and clots.
   # Upper GI bleed: Hct 16.6 down from baseline in low 30s last year.
   Etiologies include GIB given guaiac positive stool, active blood loss
   at surgical site given recent THR, hematemesis. Negative CT abdomen
   decreases likelihood of concern for aorto-enteric fistula as has had in
   past.  Concern for varicoele bleed, gastritis, PUD. BP measurements
   different on right and left; presume that left a-line with chronic
   vascular flow issues as patient otherwise shows signs of good hydration
   including not tachycardic and with good UOP
   - Appreciate GI recommendations; will continue to follow, continue
   serial hematocrit
   - Continue transfusion hct goal > 25
   - Continue to trend hematocrit q4hr
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Continue to assess BPs on right vs left and volume resuscitation with
   blood/fluid based on clinical status, MAP >65
   # Respiratory: Patient intubated semi-electively for GI procedure.
   Prior she has expressed wish to be DNR/DNI.  She agreed to be intubated
   for her EGD.  Currently she is saturating well on 50% FiO2 and a PEEP
   of 5.  She did appear volume up on CXR after receiving blood products.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial
   - Trial 0/0 for extended period prior to extubation attempt; change to
   PSV
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   # s/p left total hip replacement: Recent surgery likely contributing to
   anemia.
   - Follow up surgery recs regarding trauma
   - Consider getting in touch with OSH ortho with anticoagulation
   recommendations; we will, however, plan to hold anticoagulation given
   GI bleed
   # CAD/Chest pain: Signs of demand ischemia on EKG. Anticipate will
   improve given resuscitation.
   - Check repeat EKG
   # CHF: EF is 30-35% based on echo in
08.  Likely ischemic.  Currently
   needs fluids and blood.  Intubated and on low PEEP.  If trouble will
   increase PEEP/FiO2. Hold diuretics for now.
   # A fib: Currently rate controlled.  If tachy, likely sign of
   re-bleeding and will need more blood.  Hold on AV nodal agents in
   setting of hypotension.
   # FEN: IVF bolus, replete electrolytes prn, will put in NG tube to

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female who presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) after falling and undergoing a left total hip replacement surgery. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a protected airway due to the risk of aspiration. She is hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 66/43 mmHg and a heart rate of 77 bpm. Her respiratory status is stable with an oxygen saturation of 99% on 50% FiO2 and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her hematocrit levels have been fluctuating between 16.6 and 36.3, indicating ongoing blood loss and transfusion requirements.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (23.3 K/uL) and platelet count (295 K/uL), but otherwise normal electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals no evidence of aortoenteric fistula, but there are non-bleeding ulcerations in the antrum and clots present.

The patient has been started on antibiotics for H. pylori eradication and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Her blood products have been cross-matched and she is being actively transfused to maintain a hematocrit goal of >25. Serial hematocrit checks are being"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F s/p fall on [**12-13**] with recent left total hip replacement on
   Aspirin and Lovenox with episode of hematemesis and hematocrit 16 with
   guaiac positive stool and GI EGD with non-bleeding ulcerations in
   antrum and clots.
   # Upper GI Bleed
   EGD revealed antral ulcers, most consistent with H. pylori infection.
   This, in conjunction with ASA and lovenox s/p hip repair, likely
   resulted in UGIB. Hct 16.6 at presentation, down from baseline in low
   30s last year. OG demonstrated blood in stomach to complete picture.
   - Appreciate GI recommendations; will continue to follow, continue
   serial hematocrit
   - Continue transfusion hct goal > 21, or evidence of end-organ hypoxia
   - Continue to trend hematocrit, now [**Hospital1 **]
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Maintain good access
   - Continue to assess BPs on right vs left and volume resuscitation with
   blood/fluid based on clinical status, MAP >65
   # Respiratory
   Patient is DNR/DNI, but we confirmed with her nephew that it would be
   acceptable to re-intubate in the peri-extubation period. She agreed to
   be intubated for her EGD. She has been doing well with minimal pressure
   support. She appeared volume up on CXR after receiving blood products.
   - Extubate
   - Small dose of Lasix prior to extubation
   - Re-intubate if fails
   # S/P
   Left total hip replacement: Recent surgery likely contributing to
   anemia. ASA and lovenox likely contributed to UGIB.
   - Follow up surgery recs regarding trauma
   - Consider getting in touch with OSH ortho with anticoagulation
   recommendations; we will, however, plan to hold anticoagulation given
   GI bleed
   # CAD/Chest pain
   Signs of demand ischemia on EKG. Anticipate will improve given
   resuscitation.
   - Check repeat EKG
   # CHF
   EF is 30-35% based on echo in
08.  Likely ischemic. Currently needs
   fluids and blood. Intubated and on low PEEP. If trouble will increase
   PEEP/FiO2. Appears near euvolemic.
   - Small dose Lasix then continue to hold diuretics for now
   # A fib. and rhythm
   Currently rate controlled. If SVT suspect volume depletion.
   - Hold on AV nodal agents in setting of hypotension.
   # FEN: IVF bolus, replete electrolytes prn, will put in NG tube to
   drain and prevent possible aspiration
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no subcutaneous heparin [**1-18**] bleed

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female who presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) after a fall and recent left total hip replacement. She was found to have antral ulcerations on EGD, most consistent with H. pylori infection, which likely resulted in the UGIB. The patient is currently intubated and receiving blood transfusions to maintain a hematocrit goal of greater than 21 or evidence of end-organ hypoxia. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 66/43 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 23.3, hemoglobin of 11.4 g/dL, platelet count of 295,000/mm3, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose of 173 mg/dL, and sodium of 17 mEq/L. Imaging shows a CXR consistent with recent blood products received. Microbiology is pending for MRSA screen. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of UGIB, respiratory support, and monitoring for any complications such as re-bleeding, infection, or organ dysfunction. The patient is DNR/DNI but has agreed to be intubated for her EGD. The plan is to extubate if she stabilizes, but re-intubation"

","The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of recent left total hip replacement. She presented with an episode of hematemesis and was found to have a hematocrit of 16, indicating significant blood loss. A gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed antral ulcers, most consistent with Helicobacter pylori infection, which likely resulted in an upper GI bleed. The patient was given aspirin and Lovenox post-hip repair, which further contributed to the bleeding. Her initial hematocrit level was in the low 30s.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Her initial chest X-ray showed evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions. She was given vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics after obtaining a sputum culture positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Her vital signs have been unstable, with low blood pressure and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. She has been transfused with blood products and maintained on a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to maintain adequate oxygenation. Her blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 54/37 mmHg to 109/78 mmHg. Her heart rate has been relatively stable, ranging from 76 to 112 beats per minute.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F s/p fall on [**12-13**] with recent left total hip replacement on
   Aspirin and Lovenox with episode of hematemesis and hematocrit 16 with
   guaiac positive stool and GI EGD with non-bleeding ulcerations in
   antrum and clots.
   .
   # Upper GI Bleed. EGD revealed antral ulcers, most consistent with H.
   pylori infection. This, in conjunction with ASA and lovenox s/p hip
   repair, likely resulted in UGIB. Hct 16.6 at presentation, down from
   baseline in low 30s last year. OG demonstrated blood in stomach to
   complete picture.
   - Appreciate GI recommendations; will continue to follow, continue
   serial hematocrit
   - Continue transfusion hct goal > 21, or evidence of end-organ hypoxia
   - Continue to trend hematocrit, now [**Hospital1 **]
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Maintain good access
   - Continue to assess BPs on right vs left and volume resuscitation with
   blood/fluid based on clinical status, MAP >65
   - Follow up c. diff, h. pylori
   .
   # Respiratory. Patient is DNR/DNI, but we confirmed with her nephew
   that it would be acceptable to re-intubate in the peri-extubation
   period. She agreed to be intubated for her EGD. She has been doing well
   with minimal pressure support. She appeared volume up on CXR after
   receiving blood products.
   - Stable s/p extubation
   - Obtain BNP
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # ARF. Likely pre-renal secondary to volume loss. Can also represent
   other etiologies, AIN/ATN/pre-renal.
   - D5W bolus
   - Check PM electrolytes
   - Trend Cr
   - Remove foley later this PM
   .
   # s/p left total hip replacement: Recent surgery likely contributing to
   anemia. ASA and lovenox likely contributed to UGIB.
   - Follow up surgery recs regarding trauma
   - Consider getting in touch with OSH ortho with anticoagulation
   recommendations; we will, however, plan to hold anticoagulation given
   GI bleed
   .
   # CAD/chest pain. Signs of demand ischemia on EKG. Anticipate will
   improve given resuscitation.
   - Check repeat EKG this am
   .
   # CHF. EF is 30-35% based on echo in
08.  Likely ischemic. Currently
   needs fluids and blood. Intubated and on low PEEP. If trouble will
   increase PEEP/FiO2. Appears near euvolemic.
   - Small dose Lasix then continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # A fib. and rhythm
   Currently rate controlled. If SVT suspect volume depletion.
   - Hold on AV nodal agents in setting of hypotension.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient underwent a left total hip replacement surgery and experienced a fall, resulting in hematemesis and a significantly low hematocrit level of 16. This was likely due to an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) caused by antral ulcerations consistent with H. pylori infection, as well as the use of aspirin and lovenox post-hip repair.

The patient also has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and chest pain suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD). Her ejection fraction (EF) is estimated to be 30-35%, indicating possible ischemic heart disease. The patient's renal function is impaired, evidenced by acute kidney injury (ARF), which may be pre-renal in nature. Additionally, the patient has evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 67/44 to 109/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and a sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including invasive ventilation, extubation, administration of Lasix, antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin), pantoprazole"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F s/p fall on [**12-13**] with recent left total hip replacement with
   episode of hematemesis and hematocrit 16 with guaiac positive stool and
   GI EGD with non-bleeding ulcerations in antrum and clots, called out
   from MICU yesterday but had episode of acute onset shortness of breath.
   .
   # SOB/Dyspnea. Improved. Likely secondary to fluid overload, consistent
   with CXR obtained during episode and on exam and by BNP. Less likely PE
   although not on heparin, air embolus from removing right femoral line.
   - Received IV lasix 40mg
   - Continue to monitor UOP
   - Interval improvement s/p lasix; very unlikely to need further workup
   such as CTA
   .
   # Upper GI Bleed. EGD revealed antral ulcers, most consistent with H.
   pylori infection. This, in conjunction with ASA and lovenox s/p hip
   repair, likely resulted in UGIB. Hct 16.6 at presentation, down from
   baseline in low 30s last year. OG demonstrated blood in stomach to
   complete picture.
   - Appreciate GI recommendations; will continue to follow, continue
   serial hematocrit
   - Continue transfusion hct goal > 21, or evidence of end-organ hypoxia
   - Continue to trend hematocrit, now [**Hospital1 **]
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Maintain to maintain good access
   - Continue to assess BPs on right vs left and volume resuscitation with
   blood/fluid based on clinical status, MAP >65
   - Follow up c. diff, h. pylori cultures
 still pending
   .
   # Respiratory. Patient is DNR/DNI, but we confirmed with her nephew
   that it would be acceptable to re-intubate in the peri-extubation
   period. She agreed to be intubated for her EGD. She has been doing well
   with minimal pressure support. She appeared volume up on CXR after
   receiving blood products. BNP
   - Stable s/p extubation
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # ARF. Improving, currently 1.3. Likely pre-renal secondary to volume
   loss. Can also represent other etiologies, AIN/ATN/pre-renal.
   - D5W bolus
   - Trend Cr
   - Remove foley later this PM if able
   .
   # s/p left total hip replacement: Recent surgery likely contributing to
   anemia. ASA and lovenox likely contributed to UGIB.
   - Continue to plan to hold anticoagulation given GI bleed
   .
   # CAD/chest pain. Previously with signs of demand ischemia on EKG.
   Repeat EKG showed interval resolution/improvement; poor baseline.
   .
   # CHF. EF is 30-35% based on echo in
08.  Likely ischemic. Currently
   needs fluids and blood. Appears near euvolemic/slight hypervolemic.
   - Continue lasix
   .
   # A fib. and rhythm. Currently rate controlled. If SVT suspect volume
   depletion.
   - Hold on AV nodal agents in setting of hypotension.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female who presented with shortness of breath, hematemesis, and anemia after a fall and left total hip replacement. She was found to have non-bleeding ulcerations in the antrum and clots. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and a previous myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed (UGIB): The patient had an episode of hematemesis and a positive guaiac test, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The EGD revealed antral ulcers, which are consistent with H. pylori infection. This, along with the use of aspirin and lovenox after hip repair, likely resulted in the UGIB. The patient's hematocrit level was 16.6 at presentation, down from her baseline in the low 30s last year.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.6, indicating possible acute kidney injury. The cause could be pre-renal secondary to volume loss, but other etiologies such as acute tubular necrosis or allergic interstitial nephritis should also be considered.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of 30-35% based on an echocardiogram from 08/20."

   - Small dose Lasix then continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # A fib. and rhythm
   Currently rate controlled. If SVT suspect volume depletion.
   - Hold on AV nodal agents in setting of hypotension.
   .
   # FEN: IVF bolus, replete electrolytes prn, will put in NG tube to
   drain and prevent possible aspiration
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no subcutaneous heparin [**1-18**] bleed
   # Access: PIVs, cordis removed
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  DNR/DNI confirmed with nephew [**Doctor First Name 10959**] health care proxy);
   nephew confirmed that re-intubation in the peri-extubation period would
   be acceptable.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: [**Age over 90 **]F recent hip fx on asa / lovenox p/w UGIB -
   required intubation for EGD / injection of ulcers, now extubated with
   stable HCT but ongoing respiratory distress from ? aspiration /
   nosocomial pneumonia.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.5 BP 130/50 HR 86 RR 18 with sat 94 on 2LNC. WD
   woman, alert and oriented, c/o thirst. JVD to mid neck at 90 deg.
   Coarse BS c rales B bases. RRR s1s2 2/6SM. Soft +BS. Trace edema. Labs
   notable for WBC 30K (from 17), HCT 33, K+ 3.1, Cr 1.6 (from 1.3). CXR
   with ? volume overload.
   Agree with plan to manage UGIB / blood loss anemia with HCT [**Hospital1 **],
   transition to PPI IV BID, ADAT. Respiratory distress improved, but
   acute bump in WBC concerning for nosocomial pneumonia - will continue
   abx for now, hold on diuresis and check BNP. Acute bump in WBC - will
   recheck with PM labs, pan cx, check UA, and follow abdominal exam
   closely given recent EGD / injection. For hypernatremia, will give IV
   D5 today as we advance her diet and allow her to drink to thirst.
   Chronic systolic CHF - hold lasix / ACEI given ARF today, recheck PM
   labs. PAF stable, hold and anticoag and dig for now. Remainder of plan
   as outlined above.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent left total hip replacement. She presented with hematemesis and a hematocrit of 16, indicating an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient also has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions.

Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient had an episode of hematemesis and a low hematocrit level, indicating an upper GI bleed. The cause of the bleed is suspected to be antral ulcers, possibly due to Helicobacter pylori infection. The patient has been treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and will continue to follow GI recommendations.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced an episode of shortness of breath, likely secondary to fluid overload. Her chest X-ray showed increased pleural effusion bilaterally. She was treated with IV Lasix and is currently stable. The respiratory distress may be due to aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has pre-renal acute kidney injury, possibly secondary to volume loss. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact etiology, and measures will be taken to manage it appropriately.
4. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of chronic systolic CHF with"
