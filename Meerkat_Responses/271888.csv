   include PE, hemoptysis from alveolar hemorrhage but none of this was

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on [**1-6**] and subsequently developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical issues.

The patient has a history of hypoxia and tachypnea, which were initially attributed to post-operative complications but have now recurred with left-sided pulmonary effusions. The presence of elevated white blood cell counts (WBCs) and growth of E. coli and Acinetobacter in sputum samples suggests a possible infection. Other potential causes for the patient's symptoms, such as pulmonary embolism or alveolar hemorrhage, have been considered but not confirmed.

The patient also exhibits leukocytosis and fever, which may be related to a pulmonary etiology. However, other possibilities, including urinary tract infection (UTI), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, or localized pneumonia/effusions, should also be considered.

Additionally, the patient has a history of cardiac issues, including hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. These conditions require ongoing management with appropriate medications and monitoring.

Finally, the patient has iron-deficiency anemia, which will need further evaluation and management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery on [**1-6**]. She has been experiencing multiple complications post-surgery, including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). 

The patient recently presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and developed a loculated left pleural effusion. She also has persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin and Tigecycline.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current problems include pulmonary hypoxia/tachypnea, likely secondary to recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. Other possible causes such as infection, fluid overload, pulmonary embolism (PE), and alveolar hemorrhage are being considered. The patient's recent sputum culture grew E. coli and Acinetobacter species.

The plan includes continuing lasix infusion for fluid overload, repeating a chest X-ray, and following up with bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis. The patient will continue to receive tobramycin and Tigecycline.

Other issues include leukocytosis/fever, which could be related to a pulmonary etiology or other sources such as urinary tract infection (UTI), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, or loculated pneumonia/eff"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with chronic respiratory failure after undergoing CABG surgery and experiencing post-operative complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheal bleeding, and left-sided exudative effusion. She has also been recently treated for E.coli and Acinetobacter infections in her sputum.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fevers, and being grossly fluid overloaded. Her vital signs show a temperature of 101.4Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 165/72 to 107/47 mmHg, heart rate between 68-81 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 367 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 100.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Other lab values, such as creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, blood glucose, electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl-, HCO3-), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST), are within normal ranges.

   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin and Tigecycline.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (crackles on exam, gross
   edema) and decompensation. Other etiologies include PE, hemoptysis from
   alveolar hemorrhage but none of this was seen on recent
   imaging/diagnostics. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and
   have bronched and performed thoracentesis. Current thought is that this
   all may related to her complicated post-op CABG course.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who has a history of CABG surgery. She was admitted to the ICU with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin and Tigecycline. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to infection, fluid overload, or complications from her post-operative CABG course. She has an elevated temperature and white blood cell count, indicating a possible pulmonary etiology. Other potential causes include urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile, loculated pneumonia/effusions, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient's cardiac status includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. She also has iron-deficiency anemia and is being monitored for any changes. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, leukocytosis, and positive cultures for Acinetobacter baumannii, suggest a possible pulmonary infection. This could be exacerbated by her recent surgery and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's edematous extremities and crackles on examination may indicate fluid overload. This can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential heart failure.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient's history of"

   infection-although pleural fluid without positive cultures, but
   elevated WBCs. Sputum growing E.coli and actinobacter. Recent sputum
   from [**3-28**] growing GNRs. Likely other components include fluid overload
   (crackles on exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Other etiologies
   include PE, hemoptysis from alveolar hemorrhage but none of this was
   seen on recent imaging/diagnostics. Thoracic and IP services have been
   involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis. Current thought
   is that this all may related to her complicated post-op CABG course.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and is currently in the ICU. She has a history of bleeding from her tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, persistent leukocytosis despite antibiotic therapy, and recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. The patient's current symptoms include pulmonary hypoxia, tachypnea, fever, and anemia. She is being treated with various medications including diuretics, antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, and anticoagulants. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactic acid levels. Imaging and diagnostic tests have been performed but did not reveal any specific cause for her symptoms. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient's symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and positive cultures for E. coli and Actinobacter suggest a possible pulmonary infection. This could be exacerbated by her immunocompromised state due to recent surgery and antibiotic therapy.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows an intake-output discrepancy, indicating potential fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and crackles on examination.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient's recurrent left-sided pleural effusions may contribute to her respiratory distress and could be related to the underlying infection or other complications such as postoperative fluid collection or thrombo"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of pulmonary infection. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, diuretics, sedatives, and respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature (38.2Â°C), slightly elevated heart rate (98 bpm), normal blood pressure, and decreased respiratory rate (20 breaths per minute). The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% while on ventilatory support.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,772 mL and a total output of 1,745 mL, resulting in a balance of 27 mL. The patient has received a significant amount of fluids through IVF (668 mL) and TF (924 mL), but there has been a significant output through urine (1,745 mL).

Respiratory support is being provided through a tracheostomy tube, with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The set tidal volume (Vt) is 370 mL, spontaneous Vt is 341 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 50%. The patient's plateau pressure is 25 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (19.6-21.4 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin (9.0 g/dL), normal sodium (116-135 mg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of pulmonary infection. The patient has been in the ICU since admission and has been experiencing various medical complications. 

24-hour events include:
- Administration of dilaudid IV resulting in low tidal volumes and desaturation, requiring a switch to volume control ventilation.
- Ongoing diuresis with furosemide drip, titrated up to 10 mg/hr due to slowing urine output, followed by the addition of chlorothiazide to augment diuresis.
- Increased free water flushes from 50 Q4H to 100 Q6H due to elevated AM sodium.
- Patient experiencing low tidal volumes overnight on pressure support and high airway pressures on assist control ventilation. Mucus plug was suctioned, and the patient became stable on pressure support 14 over 5.
- Presence of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, treated with metoprolol and diltiazem.

Allergies include codeine and unknown.

Infusions include furosemide (Lasix) at 7 mg/hr and enoxaparin (Lovenox) initiated on 03/30/2153 at 08:04 AM.

Other ICU medications include hydromorphone (Dilaudid) initiated on 03/30/2153 at 12:53 PM, lorazepam (Ativan) given on 03/31/2153 at 02:00 AM, and metoprolol and diltiazem given on 03/31/2153 at 06:35 AM and 06:50 AM, respectively.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet data as of 03/31/2153 07:26 AM shows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 38.2Â°C (100.7Â°F), Heart rate 98 bpm (range 57-131 bpm), Blood pressure 142/57 mmHg (range 84-168/36-108 mmHg), Respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute (range 7-27 breaths per minute), Oxygen saturation 96%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Mean arterial pressure 93 mmHg, Central venous pressure 15 cmH2O, Urine output 1,745 mL (since 12 AM), Fluid balance -916 mL.

   from [**3-28**] growing GNRs. Likely other components include fluid overload
   (crackles on exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Other etiologies
   include PE, hemoptysis from alveolar hemorrhage but none of this was
   seen on recent imaging/diagnostics. Thoracic and IP services have been
   involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis. Current thought

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed complications such as sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement. She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and was found to have a loculated left pleural effusion. The patient has persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin and Tigecycline. She also has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, and sputum cultures have grown E.coli and actinobacter. Other possible causes for her symptoms include fluid overload, pulmonary embolism, and alveolar hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypoxia: The patient's low tidal volumes and desats suggest that she may be experiencing pulmonary hypoxia due to her respiratory failure and potential infection.
2. Tachypnea: The patient's increased respiratory rate indicates tachypnea, which can be caused by the underlying pulmonary conditions such as infection, fluid overload, or pulmonary embolism.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
4. Sternal Wound Infection: The patient's history of CABG surgery complicated by sternal wound infection indicates a potential ongoing infection.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases her risk for clot formation and potential embolic"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin and Tigecycline.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis. Diuresis
   was minimal yesterday; however, picked up overnight after
   chlorothiazide administration.
   - Furosemide drip for goal -1 to -2 for the day, would hold off on
   further chlorothiazide as brisk diuresis may be contributing to atrial
   fibrillation at this time
   - Follow-up BAL/bronch/[**Female First Name (un) 231**] cxs
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline
   - Consult with interventional pulmonology concerning potential drainage
   of left pleural effusion
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started at 0600 this AM with rate to the 130s. Has thus far been
   refractory to three doses of 5 mg IV metoprolol as well as one dose of
   10 mg IV diltiazem. Potential causes of atrial fibrillation this
   morning include atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol increase
   form intravascular volume depletion,
   - Additional two rounds of metoprolol 5 mg IV as well as dose of 50 mg
   oral metoprolol to try to break RVR, then may consider diltiazem drip
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology. However, will need to rule out
   stool for c.diff x 3. Has multiple pending fluid, urine, and blood
   cultures.
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day yesterday until atrial fibrillation this
   AM.
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CABG who returns to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure, recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, and leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin and tigecycline. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, fever, and leukocytosis. The patient's current medications include furosemide, metoprolol, diltiazem, amiodarone, ASA, BB, and statin. She is being fed through a PEG tube and is on a ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, and there is concern for ongoing infection as indicated by positive cultures for E. coli and Acinetobacter from sputum samples. The patient's respiratory failure may be due to fluid overload, infection, and possibly other factors. Thoracic and IP services have been involved, and bronchoscopy and thoracentesis have been performed.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rates in the 130s, which has been refractory to metoprolol and diltiazem. Potential causes include atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol increase from intravascular volume depletion, and other factors. Further attempts to break the rapid ventricular response include additional doses of metop"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and has been complicated by sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin and tigecycline.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, and there is consideration of infection, although pleural fluid cultures from 3/28 were negative. However, sputum samples from 3/20 and 3/28 grew Acinetobacter with the same sensitivities. Other components of respiratory failure may include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and interventional pulmonology services have been involved, and bronchoscopy and thoracentesis have been performed. The patient's diuresis needs to be continued, and follow-up BAL/bronchial cultures are necessary.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient developed atrial fibrillation this morning with a rate in the 130s. Potential causes include atrial stretch from volume overload, catecholamine increase from intravascular volume depletion, or post-operative stress. Rate control"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and tachycardia. The patient has been experiencing fatigue, desaturation with movement, and an irregular heart rhythm. The patient's temperature is elevated, indicating a fever. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there are fluctuations. The respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, and supplemental oxygen. The patient's oxygen saturation is consistently above 95%. Physical examination reveals diffuse edema and alopecia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, anxiety, nausea/vomiting, electrolyte/fluid disorder, tachycardia, acute anemia due to blood loss, fever, wound dehiscence, cellulitis, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and lactate levels suggest the possibility of an infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The decreased breath sounds in the left inferior lung may indicate pneumonia.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and diffuse edema increase the risk of DVT.
4. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] with a chief complaint of fever and fatigue. The patient has a history of hypertension, anxiety, nausea/vomiting, electrolyte/fluid disorder, tachycardia, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, wound dehiscence, cellulitis, respiratory failure (not ARDS), and atrial fibrillation.

24-hour events include the development of fever and fatigue. The patient appeared tired all day and desaturated with movement, prompting the placement of a nasal cannula and face mask. BiPAP was planned to be used overnight with settings to be determined by the respiratory team.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2Â°F, heart rate ranging from 74-119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/46-154/71 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 8-88 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% FiO2. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV, with a tidal volume of 338 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 61 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of"

   Assessment and Plan
 73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin and Tigecycline.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis. Diuresis
   was minimal yesterday; however, picked up overnight after
   chlorothiazide administration.
   - Furosemide drip for goal -1 to -2 for the day, would hold off on
   further chlorothiazide as brisk diuresis may be contributing to atrial
   fibrillation at this time
   - Follow-up BAL/bronch/[**Female First Name (un) 231**] cxs
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline
   - Consult with interventional pulmonology concerning potential drainage
   of left pleural effusion
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started at 0600 this AM with rate to the 130s. Has thus far been
   refractory to three doses of 5 mg IV metoprolol as well as one dose of
   10 mg IV diltiazem. Potential causes of atrial fibrillation this
   morning include atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol increase
   form intravascular volume depletion,
   - Additional two rounds of metoprolol 5 mg IV as well as dose of 50 mg
   oral metoprolol to try to break RVR, then may consider diltiazem drip
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology. However, will need to rule out
   stool for c.diff x 3. Has multiple pending fluid, urine, and blood
   cultures.
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day yesterday until atrial fibrillation this
   AM.
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CABG, who developed sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She presents with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin and tigecycline. She is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of infection, fluid overload, and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved, and diuresis has been initiated. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has been refractory to medication. Potential causes include atrial stretch from volume overload or catechol increase from intravascular volume depletion. Leukocytosis and fever are likely related to a pulmonary etiology, and multiple cultures have been obtained. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, along with elevated WBCs in pleural fluid and positive cultures for E. coli and Acinetobacter, suggest an ongoing infectious process. This may lead to worsening respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid vent"

 73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin and Tigecycline.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis. Diuresis
   was minimal yesterday; however, picked up overnight after
   chlorothiazide administration.
   - Furosemide drip held o/n, approx 1.8 L negative yesterday
   - Follow-up BAL/bronch/[**Female First Name (un) 231**] cxs
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline
   - Consult with interventional pulmonology concerning potential drainage
   of left pleural effusion
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started at 0600 this AM with rate to the 130s Potential causes of
   atrial fibrillation this morning include atrial stretch from volume
   overload, catechol increase form intravascular volume depletion,
   - Rate controlled on metoprolol to 50mg q6h and dilatizem at 60mg q6h
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology. However, will need to rule out
   stool for c.diff x 3. Has multiple pending fluid, urine, and blood
   cultures.
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day yesterday until atrial fibrillation this
   AM.
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CABG, who returns with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and developed loculated left pleural effusion. She has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin and Tigecycline. The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and leukocytosis/fever. The potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to fluid overload and infection, cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, and ongoing infectious processes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure and recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. If left untreated or inadequately managed, it could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or even death.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. If not properly managed, atrial fibrillation may progress to persistent or chronic atrial fibrillation, increasing the risk of thromboembolic events like stroke. Additionally, the patient is not currently anticoagulated, which further increases the risk of thromboembolism.
3. Ongoing infectious processes: The patient has leukocytosis/fever and positive cultures for"

   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 3636**] was seen, examined and discussed on rounds with the ICU team
   and I agree with the note above. Briefly, she is a 73 yo women with a
   complex post-CABG ([**12-15**]) course w/ VAP, Trach and peg, mediastinitis,
   loculated pleural effusion, fevers, trache bleeding. Currently on
   tigacyclin/tobramycin for multiresistant acinetobacter. Yesterday had
   AF w/RVR requiring additional beta blocker and CCB. Further diuresis
   over last 24-48 hr with lasix drip. Persistently febrile with high wbc.
   Currently Tm 101.2 HR 77 AF, 124/70, 20 on PS15/5 97% .5 fi02. Neg over
   1 liter over 24 hr. On exam, diffuse anasarca, but improved c/w
   yesterday, dullness l base, no crackles, wheezes - normal bs, chest
   wall/abd wall edema. Sternal wound with pink granulation tissue - no
   tenderness or draining pus with palpation. Notable lab studies include
   wbc 21.1, hct 29, cr .8, BAL cx from 22nd growing acinetobacter, pl cx
   neg
   In summary, 73 yo w/ complex post cabg course including
   hypoxemia/tachypnea w/resp failure and acinetobacter/e coli infection
   and loculated pleural effusion. We will continue to treat the
   acinetobacter with two antibiotics. Will check tobra peak and continue
   to assess for other sources of infection. The loculated pleural fluid
   continues to be a potential source of persistent infection. Per
   discussions with IP yesterday, it does not appear that a pigtail
   catheter will sufficiently drain this space. Would suggest additional
   discussions with TSurg on Monday regarding ?operative solutions. We
   will continue to treat Atrial fibrillation with amio/beta blockers and
   calcium channel blocker. Resume lasix drip and will diurese as needed
   going forward. Monitor HR on two nodal agents. Consider further
   attempts at vent wean today and consider trial of PassyMuir valve (had
   used this at rehab) and mobilization once the atrial fibrillation has
   stablized. Continue lovenox sq. RemainsFull Code.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a complex post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) course, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheostomy, and peg tube placement, as well as mediastinitis and loculated pleural effusion. She is currently being treated with tigecycline and tobramycin for multi-resistant Acinetobacter infection. She had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF w/RVR) requiring additional beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker. Further diuresis was performed over the last 24-48 hours with Lasix drip. She remains febrile with high white blood cell count (WBC). The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 101.2Â°F, heart rate 77 beats per minute (AF), blood pressure 124/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute on pressure support 15 cmH2O with 5 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), oxygen saturation 97% on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The patient has diffuse anasarca, but improved compared to yesterday, dullness at the base of the left lung, no crackles or wheezes, normal breath sounds, chest wall, and abdominal wall edema. The sternal wound shows pink granulation tissue without tenderness or draining pus with palpation."

   Assessment and Plan
 73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin and Tigecycline.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis. Good
   diuresis yesterday.
   - Furosemide drip held o/n, approx 1.8 L negative yesterday, goal of 1
   L negative today
   - Follow-up BAL/bronch/[**Female First Name (un) 231**] cxs
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline
   - Consult with interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery concerning
   potential drainage of left pleural effusion
   - Wean pressure support as tolerated
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started [**3-31**] with rate to the 130s Potential causes of atrial
   fibrillation this morning include atrial stretch from volume overload,
   catechol increase form intravascular volume depletion,
   - Rate controlled on metoprolol to 50mg q6h and dilatizem at 60mg q6h
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology. However, will need to rule out
   stool for c.diff x 3. Has multiple pending fluid, urine, and blood
   cultures.
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   - D/c a-line
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day yesterday until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**]
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin, dilt

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on [1-6]. Postoperatively, she developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
- She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and was found to have a loculated left pleural effusion.
- The patient has persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin and Tigecycline.
- She is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, with recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions.
- There is suspicion of infection, as indicated by elevated white blood cell counts in the pleural fluid and growth of E. coli and Acinetobacter in the sputum cultures.
- Other contributing factors to her respiratory failure include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and decompensation.
- Thoracic and interventional pulmonology services have been involved, performing bronchoscopy and thoracentesis.
- The plan includes continuing tobramycin and tigecycline, consulting with interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery for potential drainage of the left pleural effusion, weaning pressure support as tolerated, and further investigation of pending cultures.
- The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely due to atrial stretch"

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 90/58 to 139/87 mmHg, heart rate of 102 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including enoxaparin, lorazepam, and tobramycin. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's recent imaging reveals an abnormal chest X-ray. The patient's physical examination is largely unremarkable except for an atrial fibrillation rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source and appropriate treatment.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary"

   increase in right pleural effusion. Splenic hypodenisities more
   apparent on today's study. Otherwise no sig change. No organized fluid
   collection. Persistant ascites, left pleural effusion and rll
   consolidation.
   Assessment and Plan
 73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin and Tigecycline.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis.
   - Furosemide drip has been held since [**3-31**], approx 1 L positive
   yesterday, goal of 1 L negative today
   - Follow-up BAL/bronch/[**Female First Name (un) 231**] cxs
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline, +BCx ID suggests adding
   vancomycin
   - Consult with interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery concerning
   potential drainage of left pleural effusion
   - Wean pressure support as tolerated
   - Obtain CT chest
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started [**3-31**] with rate to the 130s Potential causes of atrial
   fibrillation included atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol
   increase form intravascular volume depletion,
   - Rate controlled on metoprolol to 50mg q6h and dilatizem at 60mg q6h,
   continued on amiodarone
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx now + for GPC in pairs and
   clusters from [**3-31**], through tobramycin and tigecycline
 ID following.
   C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Has multiple other pending fluid,
   urine, and blood cultures.
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline, adding vancomycin
   - Pull PICC and culture tip
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day yesterday until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**]
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin, dilt

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She has been complicated by sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of factors including infection, fluid overload, and decompensation. The sputum cultures have grown E. coli and Acinetobacter, and the patient is already on tobramycin and tigecycline. However, considering the recent blood culture results showing growth of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, it is recommended to add vancomycin to the antibiotic regimen.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has been rate-controlled with metoprolol and diliazem. The potential causes of atrial fibrillation include atrial stretch from volume overload or catechol increase from intravascular volume depletion.

Additionally, the patient has leukocytosis and fever, which are likely related to a pulmonary etiology. Blood cultures have been positive for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters since 3/31, and the patient is already on tobramycin and tigecycline. Vancomycin should be added to the antibiotic regimen, and ongoing infectious disease consult input is appreciated.

The patient's cardiac history includes hypertension,"

   increase in right pleural effusion. Splenic hypodenisities more
   apparent on today's study. Otherwise no sig change. No organized fluid
   collection. Persistant ascites, left pleural effusion and rll
   consolidation.
   Assessment and Plan
 73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin and Tigecycline.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis.
   - Furosemide drip has been held since [**3-31**], approx 1 L positive
   yesterday, goal of 1 L negative today
   - Follow-up BAL/bronch/[**Female First Name (un) 231**] cxs
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline, +BCx ID suggests adding
   vancomycin
   - Consult with interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery concerning
   potential drainage of left pleural effusion
   - Wean pressure support as tolerated
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started [**3-31**] with rate to the 130s Potential causes of atrial
   fibrillation included atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol
   increase form intravascular volume depletion,
   - Rate controlled on metoprolol to 50mg q6h and dilatizem at 60mg q6h,
   continued on amiodarone
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx now + for GPC in pairs and
   clusters from [**3-31**], through tobramycin and tigecycline
 ID following.
   C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Has multiple other pending fluid,
   urine, and blood cultures.
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day yesterday until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**]
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin, dilt

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on [**1-6**] and developed complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. She returns with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and has since developed loculated left pleural effusion and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin and tigecycline.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. Infection is a consideration, although the pleural fluid from [**3-28**] without positive cultures. Sputum grew E.coli and Acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from [**3-28**] also grew Acinetobacter with the same sensitivities as the [**3-20**] sample. Other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and interventional pulmonology services have been involved, and bronchoscopic and thoracentesis procedures have been performed. The plan includes holding furosemide drip, continuing tobramycin and tigecycline, adding vancomycin based on BCx ID, consulting with interventional pulmonology/thoracic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been experiencing an arterial line stop, blood culture, and fever. The patient has allergies to codeine and unknown allergens. The patient is currently receiving infusions of Enoxaparin (Lovenox) and Lorazepam (Ativan). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent symptoms. 

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, current temperature of 98.9 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 90/44 mmHg to 139/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 272 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's respiratory support parameters show good oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tracheostomy in place, clear lungs with decreased breath sounds at the left inferior lung, irregular and tachycardic heart rhythm, and well-healing chest wound without any signs of infection. The patient's neurological assessment is difficult due to difficulty in assessing orientation.

   Radiology:
   CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-4-2**] 3:06 AM:
   1. Consolidation within the right lower lobe, not significantly changed
   from the prior study.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions, with the right pleural effusion
   slightly increased in size. High attenuating material within the
   pleural effusions may reflect fibrin/blood products.
   3. Moderate ascites, slightly increased in extent.
   4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
   5. Renal cysts.
   6. Hypodensities in the spleen, uncertain etiology, but unchanged.
   CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-4-2**] 2:48 PM:
   1. Improvement but persistance of multifocal consolidation, still more
   marked in the right lower lobe, likely due to slowly resolving
   multifocal pneumonia.
   2. Enlarging bilateral pleural effusion, increased anasarca and
   increased amount of ascites. Heterogeneous left pleural effusion and
   denser intraperitoneal fluid could be related to blood.
   3. Cardiomegaly and signs of right ventricular failure.
   4. Gastrostomy tube.
   5. Dehiscence and erosions of sternal fragments in this patient with
   prior sternotomy, unchanged since [**2153-3-19**].
   6. Unchanged enlarged axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes, could be
   reactive.
   7. Diffuse ground-glass opacity and septal thickening, likely related
   to pulmonary edema.
   Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2153-4-2**] at 11:28:34 AM:  No evidence of
   endocarditis or abscess. Moderate mitral and tricupsid regurgitation.
   Mild aortic regurgitation. The right ventricle is not well seen but is
   probably mildly dilated with evidence of pressure/volume overload of
   the left ventricle. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
 73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and now
   vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased
   ascites on CT chest, will obtain diagnostic para.
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   - Furosemide drip has been held since [**3-31**], approx 1 L positive
   yesterday, goal of 1 L negative today
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline, vancomycin
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - **Consult with interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery concerning
   potential drainage of left pleural effusion
   - Wean pressure support as tolerated
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day yesterday until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].
   Also volume overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo.  Will obtain
   cardiology consult for further recommendations on how to achieve
   efficient volume status.
   - F/U cards consult
   - Restart lasix/diuril
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin, dilt
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx now + for GPC in pairs and
   clusters from [**3-31**], through tobramycin and tigecycline
 ID following.
   C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with GNR in urine.  Has
   multiple other pending fluid, urine, and blood cultures.
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline,  vancomycin
   - F/U culture tip
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started [**3-31**] with rate to the 130s Potential causes of atrial
   fibrillation included atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol
   increase form intravascular volume depletion,

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed complications including a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She presents with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, which may be due to infection, fluid overload, or decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved, and a diagnostic paracentesis has been ordered.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated and has evidence of volume overload with preserved EF on the last Echo. A cardiology consult has been requested for further recommendations on achieving efficient volume status.
3. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, likely related to a pulmonary etiology. Blood cultures are pending, and she is being treated with tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.

   Radiology:
   CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-4-2**] 3:06 AM:
   1. Consolidation within the right lower lobe, not significantly changed
   from the prior study.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions, with the right pleural effusion
   slightly increased in size. High attenuating material within the
   pleural effusions may reflect fibrin/blood products.
   3. Moderate ascites, slightly increased in extent.
   4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
   5. Renal cysts.
   6. Hypodensities in the spleen, uncertain etiology, but unchanged.
   CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-4-2**] 2:48 PM:
   1. Improvement but persistance of multifocal consolidation, still more
   marked in the right lower lobe, likely due to slowly resolving
   multifocal pneumonia.
   2. Enlarging bilateral pleural effusion, increased anasarca and
   increased amount of ascites. Heterogeneous left pleural effusion and
   denser intraperitoneal fluid could be related to blood.
   3. Cardiomegaly and signs of right ventricular failure.
   4. Gastrostomy tube.
   5. Dehiscence and erosions of sternal fragments in this patient with
   prior sternotomy, unchanged since [**2153-3-19**].
   6. Unchanged enlarged axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes, could be
   reactive.
   7. Diffuse ground-glass opacity and septal thickening, likely related
   to pulmonary edema.
   Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2153-4-2**] at 11:28:34 AM:  No evidence of
   endocarditis or abscess. Moderate mitral and tricupsid regurgitation.
   Mild aortic regurgitation. The right ventricle is not well seen but is
   probably mildly dilated with evidence of pressure/volume overload of
   the left ventricle. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
 73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and now
   vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased
   ascites on CT chest, will obtain diagnostic para.
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   - Furosemide drip has been held since [**3-31**], approx 1 L positive
   yesterday, goal of 1 L negative today
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline, vancomycin

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed complications such as sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, elevated WBCs, and positive sputum cultures for E. coli and Acinetobacter. She also has signs of fluid overload, including gross edema and basilar crackles on examination. Ascites and pleural effusion are noted on CT chest. The patient is currently receiving tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin for suspected infection. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation post-operatively. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 97/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. Her physical examination reveals tracheostomy in place, appearance of comfort, and no signs of local infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, along with the presence of hypoxemia and crackles on examination, suggest ongoing respiratory distress. This could lead to further"

   Radiology:
   CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-4-2**] 3:06 AM:
   1. Consolidation within the right lower lobe, not significantly changed
   from the prior study.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions, with the right pleural effusion
   slightly increased in size. High attenuating material within the
   pleural effusions may reflect fibrin/blood products.
   3. Moderate ascites, slightly increased in extent.
   4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
   5. Renal cysts.
   6. Hypodensities in the spleen, uncertain etiology, but unchanged.
   CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-4-2**] 2:48 PM:
   1. Improvement but persistance of multifocal consolidation, still more
   marked in the right lower lobe, likely due to slowly resolving
   multifocal pneumonia.
   2. Enlarging bilateral pleural effusion, increased anasarca and
   increased amount of ascites. Heterogeneous left pleural effusion and
   denser intraperitoneal fluid could be related to blood.
   3. Cardiomegaly and signs of right ventricular failure.
   4. Gastrostomy tube.
   5. Dehiscence and erosions of sternal fragments in this patient with
   prior sternotomy, unchanged since [**2153-3-19**].
   6. Unchanged enlarged axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes, could be
   reactive.
   7. Diffuse ground-glass opacity and septal thickening, likely related
   to pulmonary edema.
   Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2153-4-2**] at 11:28:34 AM:  No evidence of
   endocarditis or abscess. Moderate mitral and tricupsid regurgitation.
   Mild aortic regurgitation. The right ventricle is not well seen but is
   probably mildly dilated with evidence of pressure/volume overload of
   the left ventricle. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
 73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and now
   vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased
   ascites on CT chest, will obtain diagnostic para.
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   - Furosemide drip has been held since [**3-31**], approx 1 L positive
   yesterday, goal of 1 L negative today
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline, vancomycin
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - **Consult with interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery concerning
   potential drainage of left pleural effusion
   - Wean pressure support as tolerated
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started [**3-31**] with rate to the 130s Potential causes of atrial
   fibrillation included atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol
   increase form intravascular volume depletion,
   - Rate controlled on metoprolol to 50mg q6h and dilatizem at 60mg q6h,
   continued on amiodarone
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx now + for GPC in pairs and
   clusters from [**3-31**], through tobramycin and tigecycline
 ID following.
   C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with GNR in urine.  Has
   multiple other pending fluid, urine, and blood cultures.
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline,  vancomycin
   - F/U culture tip
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day yesterday until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**]
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin, dilt

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CABG who presents with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and loculated left pleural effusion. She has been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure and recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. There is also evidence of infection with positive blood cultures for GPC in pairs and clusters, and sputum cultures growing E.coli and Acinetobacter. The patient has leukocytosis and fever, with multiple other pending fluid, urine, and blood cultures.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is currently being treated with metoprolol, diliazem, and amiodarone. She also has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a new onset of atrial fibrillation post-operatively.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 97/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient's physical examination reveals tracheostomy in place, PEG tube in the left abdomen, and 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 21.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 235,000/mmÂ³, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 102 mg/dL, sodium of 134 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.6 mg/dL, and calcium of 8.2 mg/dL. The urine culture is positive for GNR.

Radiology reports indicate consolidation within the right lower lobe, bilateral pleural effusions with high attenuating material suggesting fibrin/blood products, moderate ascites, and signs of right ventricular failure. The CT chest also shows improvement but persistence of multifocal consolidation, enlargement of bilateral pleural effusion, increased anasarca, and increased amount of ascites. The echocardiogram reveals no evidence of endocarditis or abscess, but there is moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation, and evidence of pressure/volume overload of the left ventricle.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxemic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and leukocytosis/fever. The potential causes of atrial fibrillation include atrial stretch from volume overload and catechol increase from intravascular volume depletion. The patient is being weaned off pressure support as tolerated, and the plan is to consult with interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery concerning potential drainage of left pleural effusion.

The patient's allergies include codeine, and her last dose of antibiotics was tobramycin on [**2153-4-1**] at 08:46 PM and vancomycin on [**2153-4-2**] at 10:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving multiple ICU medications, including furosemide, metoprolol, diliazem, amiodarone, tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple health issues. The note indicates that the patient has a history of hypertension, anxiety, nausea/vomiting, electrolyte and fluid disorder, tachycardia, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, wound dehiscence, cellulitis, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/68 mmHg to 147/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on a ventilator with a mode of CPAP/PSV, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals several findings, including a tracheostomy in place, alopecia, PERRL, EOMI, a neck that is supple with no lymphadenopathy, clear anterior lung sounds, irregular and tachycardic heart sounds, bilateral lower extremity edema, and well-healing chest wound without any signs of infection. Neurological assessment is difficult due to the patient's difficult to assess orientation.

Laboratory results show abnormalities such as leukocytosis with a WBC count of 21.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9"

   Radiology:
   CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-4-2**] 3:06 AM:
   1. Consolidation within the right lower lobe, not significantly changed
   from the prior study.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions, with the right pleural effusion
   slightly increased in size. High attenuating material within the
   pleural effusions may reflect fibrin/blood products.
   3. Moderate ascites, slightly increased in extent.
   4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
   5. Renal cysts.
   6. Hypodensities in the spleen, uncertain etiology, but unchanged.
   CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-4-2**] 2:48 PM:
   1. Improvement but persistance of multifocal consolidation, still more
   marked in the right lower lobe, likely due to slowly resolving
   multifocal pneumonia.
   2. Enlarging bilateral pleural effusion, increased anasarca and
   increased amount of ascites. Heterogeneous left pleural effusion and
   denser intraperitoneal fluid could be related to blood.
   3. Cardiomegaly and signs of right ventricular failure.
   4. Gastrostomy tube.
   5. Dehiscence and erosions of sternal fragments in this patient with
   prior sternotomy, unchanged since [**2153-3-19**].
   6. Unchanged enlarged axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes, could be
   reactive.
   7. Diffuse ground-glass opacity and septal thickening, likely related
   to pulmonary edema.
   Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2153-4-2**] at 11:28:34 AM:  No evidence of
   endocarditis or abscess. Moderate mitral and tricupsid regurgitation.
   Mild aortic regurgitation. The right ventricle is not well seen but is
   probably mildly dilated with evidence of pressure/volume overload of
   the left ventricle. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

   Radiology:
   CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-4-2**] 3:06 AM:
   1. Consolidation within the right lower lobe, not significantly changed
   from the prior study.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions, with the right pleural effusion
   slightly increased in size. High attenuating material within the
   pleural effusions may reflect fibrin/blood products.
   3. Moderate ascites, slightly increased in extent.
   4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
   5. Renal cysts.
   6. Hypodensities in the spleen, uncertain etiology, but unchanged.
   CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-4-2**] 2:48 PM:
   1. Improvement but persistance of multifocal consolidation, still more
   marked in the right lower lobe, likely due to slowly resolving
   multifocal pneumonia.
   2. Enlarging bilateral pleural effusion, increased anasarca and
   increased amount of ascites. Heterogeneous left pleural effusion and
   denser intraperitoneal fluid could be related to blood.
   3. Cardiomegaly and signs of right ventricular failure.
   4. Gastrostomy tube.
   5. Dehiscence and erosions of sternal fragments in this patient with
   prior sternotomy, unchanged since [**2153-3-19**].
   6. Unchanged enlarged axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes, could be
   reactive.
   7. Diffuse ground-glass opacity and septal thickening, likely related
   to pulmonary edema.
   Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2153-4-2**] at 11:28:34 AM:  No evidence of
   endocarditis or abscess. Moderate mitral and tricupsid regurgitation.
   Mild aortic regurgitation. The right ventricle is not well seen but is
   probably mildly dilated with evidence of pressure/volume overload of
   the left ventricle. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
 73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and now
   vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased
   ascites on CT chest, will obtain diagnostic para.
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   - Furosemide drip has been held since [**3-31**], approx 1 L positive

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CABG who returns to the ICU with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and loculated left pleural effusion. She has persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin. The patient is also experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of infection, fluid overload, and decompensation. There are also signs of right ventricular failure and cardiomegaly on imaging.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with various infections, including a positive blood culture for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter, and a GNR in the urine. She is currently on multiple antibiotics, but the leukocytosis indicates ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely due to the combination of infection, fluid overload, and decompensation. There is a consideration for infection, but other components such as fluid overload and decompensation should also be addressed.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated and has mild aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and evidence of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on [**1-6**] and developed complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, and positive cultures for Klebsiella pneumoniae in the urine, Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli in the sputum, and coag-negative Staphylococcus in the blood culture. The patient is volume overloaded with gross edema and basilar crackles on examination. She also has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. The patient is not currently anticoagulated and has preserved left ventricular ejection fraction on last echocardiogram. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to recurrent pulmonary effusions, likely caused by infection (pleural fluid with elevated WBC count) and fluid overload.
2. Bleeding from tracheostomy site.
3. Persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been experiencing several health issues. The note details the patient's medical history, current medications, and ongoing treatments.

The patient underwent a paracentesis procedure at 02:00 PM on [**2153-4-3**], where approximately 1000cc of fluid was removed. The cardiology team recommends continuing with aggressive diuresis and considering the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as ruling out Dressler's syndrome or autoimmune causes. The patient is currently on a Lasix drip and has been given chlorthiazide 250mg IV once.

The patient's recent sputum culture grew Acinetobacter and E. coli, while the urine culture showed growth of Klebsiella. Vancomycin was discontinued based on the recommendations of the infectious disease (ID) team.

The patient has allergies to codeine and an unknown medication. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin at 09:00 AM on [**2153-4-3**] and tobramycin at 10:06 PM on the same day.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of furosemide (Lasix) at 10 mg/hour and enoxaparin (Lovenox) at 08:09 PM on [**2153-4-3**]. Other ICU medications and changes to the medical and family history are also mentioned in"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and now
   vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**] sample.
   Likely other components include fluid overload (basilar crackles on
   exam, gross edema) and decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have
   been involved and have bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased
   ascites on CT chest, will obtain diagnostic para.
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   - Furosemide drip has been held since [**3-31**], approx 1 L positive
   yesterday, goal of 1 L negative today
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline, vancomycin
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - **Consult with interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery concerning
   potential drainage of left pleural effusion
   - Wean pressure support as tolerated
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day yesterday until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].
   Also volume overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo.  Will obtain
   cardiology consult for further recommendations on how to achieve
   efficient volume status.
   - F/U cards consult
   - Restart lasix/diuril

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on [**1-6**]. She has been complicated by a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient returns with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and has developed loculated left pleural effusion and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac issues (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively), leukocytosis/fever, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and persistent leukocytosis suggest ongoing infection or fluid overload, which could lead to further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Sternal wound infection: The patient's history of a sternal wound infection post-CABG surgery indicates a possible ongoing infectious process that requires close monitoring for signs of worsening infection or dehiscence.

3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation, along with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, increases the risk of cardiac events such as arrhythmias"

","The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted with a chief complaint of [complaint]. The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including paracentesis, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement, and central venous catheter placement. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 36.1 to 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 67 and 110 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98/42 to 147/91 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14 and 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's current weight is 80.2 kg, with a baseline admission weight of 74 kg.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of nausea and vomiting. The patient's physical examination reveals several findings, including tracheostomy in place without surrounding erythema, a PEG tube in the left abdomen without surrounding erythema, bilateral pitting edema of the lower extremities, and well-healing granulation tissue in the chest wound.

Laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, albumin, lactate, and others. Microbiology cultures have grown various organisms, including Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, E. coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Gram-negative diplococci. Imaging studies have shown positive findings.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypertension, anxiety, nausea/vomiting, electrolyte/fluid disorder, tachycardia, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, wound dehiscence, cellulitis, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and other documented problems. The patient's ICU care involves nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU for [initial reason for admission]. The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided paracentesis, removing approximately 1000cc of fluid. Cardiology recommendations include treating the patient for possible pulmonary embolism (PE), aggressively diuresing, and considering the possibility of Dressler's syndrome or an autoimmune condition. The patient has multiple positive cultures for Acinetobacter, E. coli, and klebsiella species, leading to the discontinuation of vancomycin as per Infectious Disease recommendations.

The patient has a history of allergies to codeine and unknown substances. They have been receiving continuous infusions of furosemide (Lasix) at 10 mg/hour and enoxaparin (Lovenox). Other medications include Tobramycin, which was last administered on [date] at [time]. The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged from admission.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3Â°C (100.9Â°F), heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98/42 to 147/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation. The patient's weight has increased from 74 kg at admission to 80.2 kg currently.

   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, and tigecycline..
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased ascites on CT chest on
   [**4-2**].  Diagnostic paracentesis shows no evidence of SBP.
   - Furosemide drip has been restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs with goal
   diauresis 1L/day
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline, vancomycin
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   -f/u paracentesis cultures and cytology
   - **Consult with interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery concerning
   potential drainage of left pleural effusion
   - Wean pressure support as tolerated
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  Also
   volume overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo. Cardiology
   recommended aggressive diuresis given fluid overload.
   - Continue lasix/diuril
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin, dilt
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine.  Sputum culture still growing Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**],
   despite abx.  Has multiple other pending fluid, urine, and blood
   cultures.
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline
   - PICC line tip culture NGTD
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started [**3-31**] with rate to the 130s Potential causes of atrial
   fibrillation included atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol
   increase form intravascular volume depletion,
   - Rate controlled on metoprolol to 50mg q6h and dilatizem at 60mg q6h,
   continued on amiodarone

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and developed complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and loculated left pleural effusion. She also had persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin and tigecycline.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac issues such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated and has volume overload with preserved ejection fraction (EF) on last echocardiogram. There is also concern for leukocytosis/fever, likely related to a pulmonary etiology. Blood cultures have grown coag-negative staphylococcus, which is likely a contaminant. She is currently on tobramycin and tigecycline. Additionally, she has Klebsiella pneumoniae in her urine and sputum cultures still growing Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli from [3-31], despite antibiotic treatment. Other pending fluid, urine, and blood cultures are also being awaited.

The patient's medical plan includes:

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, and tigecycline..
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased ascites on CT chest on
   [**4-2**].  Diagnostic paracentesis shows no evidence of SBP.
   - Furosemide drip has been restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs with goal
   diauresis 1L/day
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline, vancomycin
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   -f/u paracentesis cultures and cytology
   - **Consult with interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery concerning
   potential drainage of left pleural effusion
   - Wean pressure support as tolerated
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  Also
   volume overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo. Cardiology
   recommended aggressive diuresis given fluid overload.
   - Continue lasix/diuril
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin, dilt
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine.  Sputum culture still growing Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**],
   despite abx.  Has multiple other pending fluid, urine, and blood
   cultures.
   - Continue tobramycin and tigecycline
   - PICC line tip culture NGTD
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started [**3-31**] with rate to the 130s Potential causes of atrial
   fibrillation included atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol
   increase form intravascular volume depletion. Rate well controlled
   overnight.
   - Rate controlled on metoprolol to 50mg q6h and dilatizem at 60mg q6h,
   continued on amiodarone

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and developed complications including a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and a loculated left pleural effusion. She also has persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin and tigecycline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, which may be due to infection or fluid overload. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated. Her cardiac status should be closely monitored.
3. Infection: The patient has multiple positive cultures for various organisms, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, and coag-negative staphylococci. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on culture results. Additionally, she has an increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection, which has been ruled out.
4. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may be related to a pulmonary etiology."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and developed complications including a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, which may be due to infection, fluid overload, or decompensation. She has had positive cultures for Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli, indicating a possible multi-drug resistant infection.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated, and her blood pressure is currently tolerating diuretic therapy.
3. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and fever, likely related to a pulmonary etiology. She has had multiple positive cultures including coag-negative staph, Acinetobacter, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient started on amiodarone for rate control."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and developed post-operative complications including a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring a tracheostomy. She presented with bleeding from the tracheostomy site and was found to have a loculated left pleural effusion and persistent leukocytosis. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, fluid overload, and decompensation. Cardiology services have recommended aggressive diuresis due to fluid overload. The patient is also being treated for aspiration pneumonia, and multiple cultures are pending to identify the causative organism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple infections including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and aspiration pneumonia. She also has ongoing positive cultures for Acinetobacter and E.coli, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Klebsiella pneumoniae has been identified in the urine, which is resistant to tobramycin.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure. She requires mechanical ventilation support.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient is volume overloaded with gross edema and basilar crackles on examination. This may contribute to her respiratory difficulties.

   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**].

   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  Also
   volume overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo. Cardiology
   recommended aggressive diuresis given fluid overload.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and developed complications including a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She is currently in the ICU with persistent leukocytosis and recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. The patient has been on tobramycin, but there has been resistance to the antibiotic, and her sputum cultures continue to grow Acinetobacter and E. coli. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Klebsiella, which is resistant to tobramycin. The patient's cardiac history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated and has been in sinus rhythm until recently. The patient's blood pressure is controlled on furosemide and diuril, and she is on multiple medications for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions may lead to further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and multiple infections, including a UTI caused by Klebsiella resistant to tobramycin, and ongoing growth of Acinetobacter and E. coli in her sputum cultures. This indicates a high risk"

   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, and [**Month/Day (4) 5661**]..
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril has been restarted 4/28 per Cardiology
   recs with goal diuresis 1-2L/day, as BP tolerates
   - Continue tobramycin and [**Month/Year (2) 5661**]
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with BPs 80s/30s, HR 50-60s.  Less likely
   secondary to diuresis. More likely secondary to metoprolol or diltiazem
   that she got at 8am, given that both hypotensive and bradycardic.
   -hold lasix gtt until MAP>60
   -d/c diltiazem
   -continue metoprolol for afib rate control
   -start dopamine temporarily until hypotension resolves. Especially to
   have TEE done this AM.
   .
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  Also
   volume overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo. Cardiology
   recommended aggressive diuresis given fluid overload.
   - Continue lasix/diuril diuresis as blood pressure tolerates
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin, dilt
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and [**Month/Year (2) 5661**]
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs.
   - Continue tobramycin and [**Last Name (LF) 5661**], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**] ID recs
   - PICC line tip culture negative
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   -Will speak with ID regarding treating UTI, given that klebsiella is
   resistant to tobramycin, and patient has a rising white count.
   -blood mycolytics if patient spikes
   - TEE this AM to evaluate for endocarditis
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Follow-up sputum cx and BAL
   - Follow-up stool cx for c.diff for two additional samples in next two
   days
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   -repeat UA
   .
   # Anemia: HCT down from 27.5 to 23.7 this AM. Hypotensive, but no
   active signs of bleeding. INR 2.0 for unclear reasons. No known liver
   disease. Maybe nutritional.
   -guaiac stools
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c lovenox given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 0.8 to 1.2.  Patient
   had dye load earlier this week for CT scan.  This is likely ATN in the
   setting of dye load.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started [**3-31**] with rate to the 130s Potential causes of atrial
   fibrillation included atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol
   increase form intravascular volume depletion. Rate well controlled
   overnight.
   - Rate controlled on metoprolol to 50mg q6h and dilatizem at 60mg q6h,
   continued on amiodarone

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is now in the ICU due to complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient has been experiencing persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, and there is evidence of ongoing infections with multiple organisms including Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient also has hypotension, anemia, acute renal failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and positive cultures for Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli suggest ongoing pulmonary infection. This could lead to worsening respiratory distress and the need for further interventions such as bronchoscopy or thoracentesis.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's gross edema and basilar crackles on examination indicate fluid overload, which can contribute to respiratory distress and cardiac dysfunction.
3. Sternal wound infection: The patient's history of CABG complicated by sternal wound infection may progress, leading to further local signs of infection, systemic infection, or the need for additional surgical interventions.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal"

They have a history of atrial fibrillation and are currently on codeine, hydromorphone, furosemide, famotidine, enoxaparin, and other medications. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/46 mmHg to 141/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is 80.2 kg, and they have been receiving IV fluids, blood products, and nutritional support. They are connected to a tracheostomy tube and receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with FiO2 set at 50%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a tracheostomy in place without any signs of infection, chest wound with well-healing granulation tissue, presence of PEG tube in the left abdomen, and 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities. Their neurological status is described as arousable to voice and nodding appropriately to questions. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, normal platelet count (Plt), and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within normal range. Other lab results indicate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She has developed multiple complications, including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient also has bleeding from her tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of infection, fluid overload, and decompensation. She has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and sputum cultures growing E. coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. Thoracic and interventional pulmonology services have been involved, performing bronchoscopy and thoracentesis. The patient is currently on a furosemide drip and diuril for diuresis and continues to receive tobramycin. Surveillance cultures are ongoing, and the plan is to continue antibiotic therapy for aspiration pneumonia as per infectious disease recommendations.

Cardiac issues include a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. The patient is not currently anticoagulated and has volume overload with preserved ejection fraction on last echocardiogram. Cardiology recommends aggressive diuresis due to fluid overload.

   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**].

   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with BPs 80s/30s, HR 50-60s.  Less likely
   secondary to diuresis. More likely secondary to metoprolol or diltiazem
   that she got at 8am, given that both hypotensive and bradycardic.
   -hold lasix gtt until MAP>60
   -d/c diltiazem
   -continue metoprolol for afib rate control
   -start dopamine temporarily until hypotension resolves. Especially to
   have TEE done this AM.

   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  Also
   volume overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo. Cardiology
   recommended aggressive diuresis given fluid overload.
   - Continue lasix/diuril diuresis as blood pressure tolerates
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin, dilt
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and [**Month/Year (2) 5661**]

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary etiology, fluid overload, and decompensation. She also has hypotension, which is less likely to be caused by diuresis and more likely due to metoprolol or diltiazem. The patient's cardiac history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated and had been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation occurred on 03/31. She is also volume overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo.

The patient's leukocytosis and fever are likely related to a pulmonary etiology. Blood cultures grew coag-negative Staphylococcus from 03/31, which is likely a contaminant. She is currently on tobramycin and an unidentified antibiotic following ID recommendations. C. Diff negative x3 (03/25, 03/23, 03/26). She now has Klebsiella in urine, resistant to tobramycin. Sputum culture still growing"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin and [**Month/Day (4) 5661**]..
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril has been restarted 4/28 per Cardiology
   recs with goal diuresis 1-2L/day, will continue lasix gtt today with
   support of dopamine
   - Continue tobramycin and [**Month/Day (2) 5661**]
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient continues to be hypotensive requiring dopamine.
   Less likely secondary to diuresis vs. antihypertensives. Diltiazem
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Given fluid bolus x 1 o/n. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to over
   diuresis, however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated
   JVP vs infection, although lactate wnl. Will continue to
   -hold lasix gtt until MAP>60
   -continue metoprolol for afib rate control if BP tolerates
   -continue dopamine as needed
   .
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem. Also volume
   overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo. Cardiology recommended
   aggressive diuresis given fluid overload. Overall LOS 7.5 L positive.
   - Continue lasix/diuril diuresis as blood pressure tolerates
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and [**Month/Year (2) 5661**]
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation
   - Continue tobramycin and [**Last Name (LF) 5661**], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**] ID recs
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   -Will speak with ID regarding treating UTI, given that klebsiella is
   resistant to tobramycin, and patient has a rising white count.
   -blood mycolytics if patient spikes
   - Will discuss further recommendations given TEE findings
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   # Anemia: HCT dropped from 27.5 to 23.7 on [**4-6**]. Stable today. Continues
   to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.0 for unclear
   reasons. No known liver disease. Maybe nutritional.
   -guaiac stools
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c lovenox given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 0.8 to 1.2.  Patient
   had dye load earlier this week for CT scan.  This is likely ATN in the
   setting of dye load.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started [**3-31**] with rate to the 130s Potential causes of atrial
   fibrillation included atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol
   increase form intravascular volume depletion. Rate well controlled
   overnight.
   - Rate controlled on metoprolol to 50mg q6h and dilatizem at 60mg q6h,
   continued on amiodarone

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is currently in the ICU due to complications including a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypotension, anemia, and acute renal failure. She has multiple positive cultures for various bacteria, including E. coli, Acinetobacter, and Klebsiella, which are resistant to some antibiotics. The patient's condition is complex, involving multiple organ systems, and she requires ongoing medical management and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sternal wound infection: The patient has a history of sternal wound infection following her CABG surgery. This infection may require surgical intervention or prolonged antibiotic therapy.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation post-operatively, which could lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not properly managed.

3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure necessitates ongoing respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation. There is also a concern for recurrent pulmonary effusions, which may require further intervention.

4. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient's persistent leukocytosis and fever suggest an ongoing infectious process. Cultures have grown multiple bacteria, indicating possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed complications including a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and later developed a loculated left pleural effusion and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.

Current Assessment:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. Sputum cultures have grown E. coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. Recent sputum samples continue to grow Acinetobacter with the same sensitivities as previous samples. Thoracic and IP services have been involved, and bronchoscopy and thoracentesis were performed. Increased pleural effusions are seen on CT chest and CXR.

Plan:
- Furosemide drip and diuril have been restarted.
- Continue tobramycin and tigecycline.
- Continue surveillance cultures.
- Interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery is not planning for repeat drainage of the left pleural effusion.
- Wean pressure support as tolerated.
- Continue antibiotic therapy for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recommendations.

2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive requiring dopamine. Diltiazem was discontinued on [**4-6**]. Metoprolol"

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril has been restarted 4/28 per Cardiology
   recs with goal diuresis 1-2L/day, as BP tolerates

   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with BPs 80s/30s, HR 50-60s.  Less likely
   secondary to diuresis. More likely secondary to metoprolol or diltiazem
   that she got at 8am, given that both hypotensive and bradycardic.
   -hold lasix gtt until MAP>60

   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm all day until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  Also
   volume overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo. Cardiology
   recommended aggressive diuresis given fluid overload.
   - Continue lasix/diuril diuresis as blood pressure tolerates
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin, dilt
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and [**Month/Year (2) 5661**]
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs.
   - Continue tobramycin and [**Last Name (LF) 5661**], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**] ID recs
   - PICC line tip culture negative
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   -Will speak with ID regarding treating UTI, given that klebsiella is
   resistant to tobramycin, and patient has a rising white count.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and has been experiencing multiple complications since admission. These include sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), bleeding from tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. Infection is a possible cause, but the pleural fluid from previous cultures did not show any positive results. Sputum cultures have grown E. coli and Acinetobacter, which are resistant to antibiotics. Other factors contributing to respiratory failure may include fluid overload and decompensation. Interventions include restarting diuretics, weaning pressure support as tolerated, and continuing antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure in the 80s/30s with a heart rate of 50-60s. This is likely not due to diuretics but possibly secondary to metoprolol or diltiazem. These medications have been held, and dopamine has been started temporarily until hypotension resolves.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient underwent several diagnostic tests, including an EKG, transesophageal echo, and stool culture, which revealed c-diff infection. The patient also had blood cultures taken on 04/06/2153 at 12:30 PM and 12:35 PM, indicating a possible fungal endocarditis. However, it is unclear if the patient truly has fungal endocarditis, and treatment has not yet been initiated.

The patient is currently on dopamine infusion at 4 mcg/kg/min and receiving other ICU medications such as midazolam (versed) and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.3 C (99.1 F), current temperature of 37 C (98.6 F), heart rate (HR) of 111 bpm with a normal range of 51-111 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 104/54 mmHg to 127/65 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute with a normal range of 12-22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%, and sinus tachycardia heart rhythm.

The patient has experienced significant fluid loss, with a total input of"

   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin and [**Month/Day (4) 5661**]..
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril has been restarted 4/28 per Cardiology
   recs with goal diuresis 1-2L/day, however currently holding for
   hypotension
   - Continue tobramycin and [**Month/Year (2) 5661**]
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient continues to be hypotensive requiring dopamine.
   Less likely secondary to diuresis vs. antihypertensives. Diltiazem
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Given fluid bolus x 1 o/n.
   -hold lasix gtt until MAP>60
   -continue metoprolol for afib rate control if BP tolerates
   -continue dopamine as needed
   .
   # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem. Also volume
   overloaded with preserved EF on last Echo. Cardiology recommended
   aggressive diuresis given fluid overload. Overall LOS 7.5 L positive.
   - Continue lasix/diuril diuresis as blood pressure tolerates
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, BB, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and [**Month/Year (2) 5661**]
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation
   - Continue tobramycin and [**Last Name (LF) 5661**], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**] ID recs
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input
   -Will speak with ID regarding treating UTI, given that klebsiella is
   resistant to tobramycin, and patient has a rising white count.
   -blood mycolytics if patient spikes
   - Will discuss further recommendations given TEE findings
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   # Anemia: HCT dropped from 27.5 to 23.7 on [**4-6**]. Stable today. Continues
   to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.0 for unclear
   reasons. No known liver disease. Maybe nutritional.
   -guaiac stools
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c lovenox given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 0.8 to 1.2.  Patient
   had dye load earlier this week for CT scan.  This is likely ATN in the
   setting of dye load.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   Started [**3-31**] with rate to the 130s Potential causes of atrial
   fibrillation included atrial stretch from volume overload, catechol
   increase form intravascular volume depletion. Rate well controlled
   overnight.
   - Rate controlled on metoprolol to 50mg q6h and dilatizem at 60mg q6h,
   continued on amiodarone

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CABG who developed complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, fever, hypotension, anemia, acute renal failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple infections, including a sternal wound infection, aspiration pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. The presence of fever and leukocytosis suggests ongoing or recurrent infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure requires close monitoring and intervention. Recurrent pulmonary effusions and the need for repeated drainage indicate ongoing respiratory compromise.

3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is hypotensive and requires dopamine support. This may be due to fluid overload, medication side effects, or septic shock.

4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen from 0.8 to 1.2, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be related to dye load from imaging studies or the development of acute tubular necrosis.

5. Coagulopathy: The elevated INR of 2.0 indicates a prolonged clotting time. This may be due to nutritional"

   Assessment and Plan 73 yr old woman with long course after CABG c/b
   fungemia, mediastinitis now with poly microb PNA and new vegetation on
   vales
   In past 24 hours primary development has been new vasopressor
   requirement.
   1.       Hypotension: Complicated picture.  DDX initial thought was
   iatrogenic, maybe calcium channel blocker and beta blocker, but now on
   low dose dopa to maintain MAP 60. CXR looks more volume overloaded. DDX
   is decomp CHF which would require need to press on with diuresis using
   the dopa as a bridge versus evolving early sepsis and need for volume
   resusitation. Either could be true but for now will try diuresis and
   watch closely MAPS and UOP and lactate.
   2.       New Veg; unclear how old or from what source. Would favor
   empiric Rx for candidal adding Fluc
 discuss further with ID
   3.       ARF: in setting of CHF and dye load- likely ATN- trying to
   maintain UOP.
   4.    Resp Failure: stable vent settings no acute change.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with endocarditis and currently in the ICU. The patient has been receiving antibiotics and has undergone a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to assess the condition of their heart valves. Dopamine has been added to the patient's medication regimen. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/50 to 127/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy tube. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a volume control mode, set at a tidal volume of 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient has received blood transfusions totaling 2,950 mL and urine output of 2,940 mL since admission.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Infective endocarditis: The patient's condition of endocarditis increases the risk of complications such as heart valve damage, abscess formation, embolic events, and septicemia.
2. Sepsis: Given the presence of fever, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and positive blood cultures, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Hypotension: DDX initial thought was iatrogenic, maybe CCB and
   BB, but now on low dose dopa to maintain MAP 60. CXR looks more volume
   overloaded. DDX is decomp CHF and need to press on with diuresis using
   the dopa as a bridge versus evolving early sepsis. Either could be true
   but for now will try diuresis and watch closely MAPS and UOP and
   lactate.
   2.       New Veg; unclear how old or from what source. Would favor
   empric Rx for cadidal adding Fluc
 discuss further with ID
   3.       ARF; in setting of CHF and dye load- likely ATN- trying to
   maintain UOP.
   4.    Resp Failure: stable vent settings no acute change.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with endocarditis. The patient has undergone several interventions and tests, including transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), dopamine infusion, stool culture, blood cultures, and other medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and they are being treated with dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 60. There is a concern for possible cardiogenic shock or early sepsis. The patient's condition will be closely monitored with measurements of MAP, urine output (UOP), and lactate levels.

2. New vegetation: The patient has developed new vegetations on the TEE, but the source is unclear. Empirical treatment for candidal infection may be necessary, and further discussion with an infectious disease specialist is planned.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, possibly due to congestive heart failure (CHF) and exposure to contrast dye. The primary goal is to maintain urine output and prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with stable settings. No acute changes in respiratory status have been noted.

Other ongoing issues mentioned in the housestaff notes are not specified in the provided information.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their critical condition, including treatment of hypotension, addressing the new vegetation, managing ARF,"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held overnight. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. [**Month (only) 11**] restart lasix gtt and
   diuril this afternoon as blood pressure tolerates to keep patient net
   even.
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient continues to be hypotensive requiring dopamine.
   Diltiazem and metoprolol d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Likely secondary to over-diuresis,
   however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs
   infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -restart diuresis with lasix gtt as blood pressure tolerates with goal
   of net even
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   -weaned off dopamine
   - restart metoprolol 12.5mg
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   - Continue tobramycin (day 12), tigecycline (day 13), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input, will discuss

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, likely due to infection. Previous sputum cultures have grown E. coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. Thoracic and IP services have been involved, and fluid overload is also suspected.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive, requiring dopamine. Over-diuresis may be contributing to the hypotension, but the patient is still fluid positive with elevated JVP.
3. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient's leukocytosis and fever are likely related to a pulmonary etiology. Blood cultures have grown coag-negative Staphylococcus from 3/31, which is likely a contaminant. She is currently on tobramycin and tigecycline, and C. difficile has been negative multiple times. However, her sputum culture still grows Acinetobacter and"

   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held overnight. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. Hold lasix gtt for now.
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.

   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   -weaned off dopamine
   - restart metoprolol if pressure improves

   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia.
   - Continue tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin per ID recs
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input, will discuss
   with ID ? antifungals and further recommendations given TEE findings

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held overnight. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. Hold lasix gtt for now.
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient continues to be hypotensive requiring dopamine.
   Diltiazem and metoprolol d/c
d  [**4-6**]. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to over-diuresis,
   however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs
   infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -hold diuresis with lasix
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   -weaned off dopamine
   - restart metoprolol if pressure improves
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia.
   - Continue tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin per ID recs
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input, will discuss
   with ID ? antifungals and further recommendations given TEE findings
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now both being
   held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. Overall LOS 7.5 L positive. However this
   is being held in the setting of hypotension.
   - Hold lasix/diuril diuresis given hypotension
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d and BB held for hypotension.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 23.2, despite 1u PRBCs overnight. HCT yesterday 21.3.
   Continues to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.0
   for unclear reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.
   -guaiac stools
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 0.8 to 1.4.  Patient
   had dye loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the setting of
   dye load vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis. FE urea 52.4,
   suggesting ATN as likely etiology.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old female who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She is currently in the ICU due to complications including a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, persistent leukocytosis, hypotension, anemia, and acute renal failure. The respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors such as infection (with sputum cultures growing E. coli and Acinetobacter), fluid overload (evidenced by basilar crackles on examination and gross edema), and decompensation. The patient has been treated with tobramycin, vancomycin, and tigecycline, but the infection persists with Klebsiella in the urine and Acinetobacter and E. coli in the sputum.

The hypotension is ongoing despite dopamine infusion, and the patient is not responding to diuretics due to fluid overload. The anemia is likely due to nutritional causes and the acute renal failure is suspected to be either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from dye loads or pre-renal from over-diuresis.

Other medical conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. The patient is not currently anticoagulated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CABG, who developed sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG. She has been in the ICU for several weeks with recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, persistent leukocytosis, hypotension, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has multiple positive cultures including Acinetobacter and E. coli, resistant to tobramycin, and Klebsiella in the urine. The patient is also experiencing anemia, acute renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent leukocytosis and positive cultures suggest a potential ongoing infection. The cultures have grown various bacteria including Acinetobacter, E. coli, and Klebsiella, which are resistant to some antibiotics.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and hypoxemic respiratory failure indicate a potential complication related to her respiratory system.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires careful monitoring and management to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, possibly due to dye loads, overdiuresis, or other factors.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which may be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed complications including a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring a tracheostomy and PEG. She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and a loculated left pleural effusion. She has persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin. The patient also has hypotension, anemia, and acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, which can contribute to respiratory distress and hypoxia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and positive cultures for various organisms including Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This suggests a possible ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload with gross edema and basilar crackles on examination. This can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. This can lead to hemodynamic instability and the need for rate control.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.8 to 1.4, indicating acute renal failure. This can be attributed to factors such as dye load, prerenal azotemia, or intrinsic renal injury.
6. Anemia: The patient has a low HCT level, indicating anemia. This can contribute to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple complex medical issues that require careful management and monitoring to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Hypotension: Able to wean off dopa yesterday after small volume
   challenge.
   Complicated and tenuous picture.  Got hypotensive with diuresis and
   rate control Friday and part of Saturday  but is in decompensated heart
   failure and ultimately needs diuresis and rate control to make any
   progress.  With better BP today
 we will restart low dose bblocker and
   diuretics watching closely goal 500 cc max neg.
   2. Leukocytosis: DDx endocarditis, c diff, line infection, worsening
   mediastinitis. Continue ABX, call cardiac Surgery ([**Doctor Last Name **]) to look at
   wound
 open at base and draining this AM, add Fluconzaole vs Ambisome
   for endocarditis
   3. New Veg; unclear how old or from what source. If she is still Full
   code, Would favor empiric Rx for candidal but will discuss further with
   ID
   4. ARF: in setting of CHF and dye load- likely ATN based on FeUrea-
   trend and avoid nephrotoxins
 Hold Tobra

   5. Resp Failure: convert to PSV as tolerated
   6. Anemia: re

 repeat hemolysis labs given endovascular
   infection. Tx fr less than 21
   Overall-  need to organize a family meeting this week with
   representation from MICU, Cardiac [**Doctor First Name **], ID and have a frank discussion
   regarding which problems are likely to be fixable- by what means, and
   overall goals of care.
   Would get SW involved as well. Brached NDR topic with family over
   weekend and they are contemplating.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has a history of critical illness, including complications such as endocarditis, C. difficile infection, line infection, worsening mediastinitis, acute kidney injury, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient is in decompensated heart failure, which requires diuretics and rate control. There is also a mention of endocarditis, which can lead to further cardiac issues.

2. Kidney complications: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) based on the trend in blood urea nitrogen levels. Measures should be taken to avoid nephrotoxins and hold nephrotoxic medications like Tobra.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and needs conversion to pressure support ventilation (PSV) as tolerated. The patient also has poor air movement at the bases of the lungs, indicating possible lung issues such as pneumonia or effusion.

4. Infection complications: The patient has leukocytosis, suggesting an ongoing infection. Differential diagnoses include endocarditis, C. difficile infection, line infection, and worsening mediastinitis. Antibiotics have been continued, and consultation with cardiac surgery is needed for the wound at the base.

5. Hematological complications: The patient has anemia and should be evaluated for causes"

","The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions, including atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (ARF), leukocytosis, anemia, and possible endocarditis. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with high heart rate, low blood pressure, and decreased air movement at the bases of the chest. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and their respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, assist-control ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 146. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and is receiving diuretics and beta-blockers. The patient's blood cultures were drawn from the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a low hemoglobin level. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactic acid levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but there is a slight decrease in albumin and calcium levels. The patient's arterial blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Hypotension: Complicated picture.  DDX initial thought was
   iatrogenic, maybe calcium channel blocker and beta blocker, but now on
   low dose dopa to maintain MAP 60. CXR looks more volume overloaded. DDX
   is decomp CHF which would require need to press on with diuresis using
   the dopa as a bridge versus evolving early sepsis and need for volume
   resusitation. Either could be true but for now will try diuresis and
   watch closely MAPS and UOP and lactate.
   2. New Veg; unclear how old or from what source. Would favor empiric Rx
   for candidal adding Fluc
 discuss further with ID
   3. ARF: in setting of CHF and dye load- likely ATN- trying to maintain
   UOP.
   4. Resp Failure: stable vent settings no acute change.

   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held x36 hours. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. Would not continue
   diuresis given worsening renal function
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 90-100s. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Likely secondary to over-diuresis, however patient still
   markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs infection, although
   lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -restart diuresis with lasix gtt as blood pressure tolerates with goal
   of net even
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement. She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin. The patient also has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, likely due to infection or fluid overload, with sputum cultures growing Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli. She has worsening renal function with elevated creatinine, hemolysis vs. DIC, and acute renal failure. The patient's recent labs and imaging studies are also included.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sternal wound infection: The patient has a history of sternal wound infection post-CABG surgery. This infection may continue to worsen and require further intervention.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. This condition may continue to cause hemodynamic instability and require close monitoring and management.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and the need for ventilatory support. This may indicate ongoing respiratory failure and the possibility of pneumonia or other lung infections.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a medical history significant for multiple comorbidities, including but not limited to diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease on dialysis. She is currently admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to a wound infection.

The patient's recent events include wound culture obtained at 11:12 AM, blood culture from the PICC line at 11:21 AM, and stool culture at 02:46 PM with a suspicion of C-diff infection. She was started on ambisome for presumed endovascular fungal infection, but further evaluation by ophthalmology did not reveal any evidence of fungal infection. Instead, a superficial lesion on the left retina was noted, which could be a cotton wool spot or myelin. However, the possibility of fungal infection cannot be completely ruled out, and a follow-up evaluation in two weeks is planned.

The patient's medications were adjusted, including restarting metoprolol 12.5mg po bid. Her chest X-ray showed pleural fluid/thickening along the left chest wall, increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, minimal right pleural fluid, and hazy opacity at the right base laterally. These findings suggest possible pneumonia.

Her hemoglobin (HCT) level decreased to 20.7, indicating potential hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coag"

The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple medical conditions. The patient has been experiencing various complications and medical issues since admission. The note highlights the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection/dehiscence: The patient has a sternal wound with a culture taken, indicating a possible wound infection. There is also mention of a superficial lesion on the left retina, which could be related to a systemic fungal infection.
2. Hemolysis/DIC: The patient's laboratory results suggest hemolysis versus disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This could lead to anemia and bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory distress or failure. The CXR shows left lower lobe collapse/consolidation and minimal right pleural fluid, suggesting possible pneumonia or atelectasis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension, which may be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and magnesium (Mg++). These imbalances can affect various organ functions and overall health.
6. Fever: The patient has had persistent fever, indicating an"

   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held x36 hours. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. [**Month (only) 11**] restart lasix gtt and
   diuril this afternoon as blood pressure tolerates to keep patient net
   even.
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.

   # Hypotension: Patient continues to be hypotensive requiring dopamine.
   Diltiazem and metoprolol d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Likely secondary to over-diuresis,
   however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs

   of net even
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates

   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   - Continue tobramycin (day 13), tigecycline (day 14), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   -Continue ambisome (day 2) for presumed endovascular fungal infection
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input will discuss with
   ID antifungals, given that currently we are continuing aggressive
   treatment

   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now both being
   held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. Overall LOS 7.5 L positive. However this
   is being held in the setting of hypotension.
   - restart lasix/diuril diuresis this afternoon
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -restart metoprolol this AM at low dose. Titrate up for HR control as
   BP tolerates.

   # Anemia: HCT 23.2, despite 1u PRBCs overnight. HCT yesterday 21.3.
   Continues to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.0
   for unclear reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.
   -guaiac stools
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 0.8 to 1.4.  Patient
   had dye loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the setting of
   dye load vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis. FE urea 52.4,
   suggesting ATN as likely etiology.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and has been experiencing several complications since then. These complications include a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, bleeding from the tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis despite antibiotic treatment.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis with fever, worsening sternal wound, and acute renal failure. The patient is on multiple antibiotics for suspected infections, including tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin. She is also receiving antifungal treatment with ambisome for presumed endovascular fungal infection.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and anemia. Her vital signs are unstable, with persistent hypotension and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sternal wound infection: The patient's sternal wound is worsening, and there is a concern for ongoing infection. The wound culture showed growth of Gram-negative diplococci, which could indicate a bacterial infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to treat this infection.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation post-operatively and is currently not anticoagulated. This increases the risk of throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held overnight. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. [**Month (only) 11**] restart lasix gtt and
   diuril this afternoon as blood pressure tolerates to keep patient net
   even.
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient continues to be hypotensive requiring dopamine.
   Diltiazem and metoprolol d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Likely secondary to over-diuresis,
   however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs
   infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -restart diuresis with lasix gtt as blood pressure tolerates with goal
   of net even
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   -weaned off dopamine
   - restart metoprolol 12.5mg
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   - Continue tobramycin (day 13), tigecycline (day 14), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   -Continue ambisome (day 2) for presumed endovascular fungal infection
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input will discuss with
   ID antifungals, given that currently we are continuing aggressive
   treatment
   -recheck C diff
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now both being
   held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. Overall LOS 7.5 L positive. However this
   is being held in the setting of hypotension.
   - restart lasix/diuril diuresis this afternoon
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -restart metoprolol this AM at low dose. Titrate up for HR control as
   BP tolerates.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 23.2, despite 1u PRBCs overnight. HCT yesterday 21.3.
   Continues to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.0
   for unclear reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.
   -guaiac stools
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 0.8 to 1.4.  Patient
   had dye loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the setting of
   dye load vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis. FE urea 52.4,
   suggesting ATN as likely etiology.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and is now in the ICU due to complications such as sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis/fever, anemia, acute renal failure, and cardiac issues including atrial fibrillation. The patient's medical team is managing these conditions with various treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulants.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening respiratory failure leading to further lung infection or pneumonia, development of septic shock due to uncontrolled infection, progression of renal failure requiring dialysis, and worsening cardiac function leading to heart failure.

It is important for the medical team to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, continue aggressive treatment for infections, optimize fluid balance, and consider interventions to improve cardiac function and renal function. Additionally, nutritional support should be provided to address the patient's anemia.

Overall, the patient requires careful monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications to prevent further deterioration and improve her chances of recovery."

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.

   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held x36 hours. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. [**Month (only) 11**] restart lasix gtt and

   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support

   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   - Continue tobramycin (day 13), tigecycline (day 14), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   -Continue ambisome (day 2) for presumed endovascular fungal infection
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input will discuss with
   ID antifungals, given that currently we are continuing aggressive
   treatment
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs

   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now diltiazem
   being held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. Overall LOS 7.5 L positive. However this
   is being held in the setting of hypotension.
   - restart lasix/diuril diuresis this afternoon
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -restart metoprolol this AM at low dose. Titrate up for HR control as
   BP tolerates.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 23.2, despite 1u PRBCs overnight. HCT yesterday 21.3.
   Continues to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.0
   for unclear reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.
   -guaiac stools
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 0.8 to 1.4.  Patient
   had dye loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the setting of
   dye load vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis. FE urea 52.4,
   suggesting ATN as likely etiology.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins

","The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, which may be due to infection, fluid overload, or decompensation. There are also elevated white blood cell counts in the pleural fluid, and sputum cultures have grown Acinetobacter and E. coli, indicating a possible infection.

2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive, requiring dopamine support. This may be secondary to over-diuresis or infection, although the lactate levels are normal. The patient is also markedly fluid-positive with an elevated jugular venous pressure.

3. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, likely related to a pulmonary etiology. Blood cultures have grown coag-negative staphylococci, which is likely a contaminant. The patient is on tobramycin and tigecycline following the culture results. C. difficile has been negative multiple times, but the patient has Klebsiella pneumoniae in the urine, which is resistant to tobramycin. Sputum cultures are still growing Acinetobacter and E. coli from previous samples. The patient's wound culture also shows worsening sternal wound.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. The patient is not currently antico"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypotension, anemia, and acute renal failure. 

The patient's current medications include tobramycin, vancomycin, tigecycline, ambisome, famotidine, metoprolol, and ASA. The patient is also on a furosemide drip and diuril for fluid overload. 

The patient has multiple positive cultures including Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, yeast, and coag-negative Staphylococcus. The sputum culture still grows Acinetobacter and E. coli from 3/31, despite antibiotic treatment. The urinary catheter tip culture grows highly resistant Klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. 

The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and a low hematocrit level. The patient's echocardiogram showed small vegetations, possibly fungal. 

The patient's ongoing medical issues include hypoxemic respiratory failure, leukocytosis/fever, hypotension, anemia, and acute renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG. She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and loculated left pleural effusion. She has persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin. The patient's recent sputum cultures have grown Acinetobacter and E. coli, which are resistant to tobramycin. Her urine culture shows highly resistant Klebsiella, also resistant to tobramycin. There are ongoing concerns about her hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, acute renal failure, and potential fungal endophthalmitis. The patient's medical team is considering restarting diuretics, continuing antibiotic therapy, and planning for further evaluation and management."

   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held overnight. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. [**Month (only) 11**] restart lasix gtt and
   diuril this afternoon as blood pressure tolerates to keep patient net
   even.
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient continues to be hypotensive requiring dopamine.
   Diltiazem and metoprolol d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Likely secondary to over-diuresis,
   however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs
   infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -restart diuresis with lasix gtt as blood pressure tolerates with goal
   of net even
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   -weaned off dopamine
   - restart metoprolol 12.5mg
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   - Continue tobramycin (day 12), tigecycline (day 13), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input, will discuss
   with ID antifungals, given that currently we are continuing aggressive
   treatment
   -recheck C diff
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now both being
   held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. Overall LOS 7.5 L positive. However this
   is being held in the setting of hypotension.
   - restart lasix/diuril diuresis this afternoon
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -restart metoprolol this AM at low dose. Titrate up for HR control as
   BP tolerates.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 23.2, despite 1u PRBCs overnight. HCT yesterday 21.3.
   Continues to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.0
   for unclear reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.
   -guaiac stools
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 0.8 to 1.4.  Patient
   had dye loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the setting of
   dye load vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis. FE urea 52.4,
   suggesting ATN as likely etiology.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She has been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypotension, fever, and worsening sternal wound. The patient has also had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is currently on multiple medications including tobramycin, tigecycline, vancomycin, and others. Her current vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.6Â°C (99.6Â°F), heart rate 117 bpm, blood pressure 114/54 mmHg, respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and persistent leukocytosis. The presence of Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli in the sputum culture suggests a potential bacterial infection. Thoracic and interventional pulmonology services have been involved, but further intervention may be required to address the respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive, requiring dopamine support. There is a concern for over"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held x36 hours. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. Would not continue
   diuresis given worsening renal function
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 94-127. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Likely secondary to over-diuresis, however patient still
   markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs infection, although
   lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   - titrated up metoprolol to 25mg po bid
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   - Continue tobramycin (day 14), tigecycline (day 15), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   -Continue ambisome (day 3) for presumed endovascular fungal infection
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input will discuss with
   ID antifungals, given that currently we are continuing aggressive
   treatment
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now diltiazem
   being held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension.
   - consider restarting lasix/diuril diuresis as BP tolerates
   - Continue amiodarone, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] po. Titrate up for HR control as BP
   tolerates.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 23.6
stable overnight.  Continues to be hypotensive, but
   no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.1 for unclear reasons. No known
   liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional. LDH elevated, haptoglobin low,
   fibrinogen borderline low, consistent with hemolysis vs. DIC.
   -check HCT [**Hospital1 **], transfuse to keep HCT>21
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox and ASA given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 1.8 to 2.4 overnight.
   Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the
   setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis. FE
   urea 52.4, suggesting ATN as likely etiology.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement. She presented with bleeding from the tracheostomy site and recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. The patient has persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin. She also has hypotension, anemia, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent pulmonary effusions and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for infection, fluid overload, and decompensation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's systolic BPs have been fluctuating between 94-127, indicating potential hypotension. This may be due to over-diuresis or infection.
3. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection. Cultures have grown coag-negative staph, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii, which are resistant to certain antibiotics.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 23.6, indicating anemia. There are signs of hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
5. Acute renal failure: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held x36 hours. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. Would not continue
   diuresis given worsening renal function
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 94-127. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Likely secondary to over-diuresis, however patient still
   markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs infection, although
   lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   - titrated up metoprolol to 25mg po bid
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   - Continue tobramycin (day 13), tigecycline (day 14), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   -Continue ambisome (day 2) for presumed endovascular fungal infection
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input will discuss with
   ID antifungals, given that currently we are continuing aggressive
   treatment
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now diltiazem
   being held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension.
   - consider restarting lasix/diuril diuresis as BP tolerates
   - Continue amiodarone, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] po. Titrate up for HR control as BP
   tolerates.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 23.6
stable overnight.  Continues to be hypotensive, but
   no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.1 for unclear reasons. No known
   liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional. LDH elevated, haptoglobin low,
   fibrinogen borderline low, consistent with hemolysis vs. DIC.
   -check HCT [**Hospital1 **], transfuse to keep HCT>21
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox and ASA given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 1.8 to 2.4 overnight.
   Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the
   setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis. FE
   urea 52.4, suggesting ATN as likely etiology.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and a loculated left pleural effusion. She also had persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, which can lead to decreased oxygenation and hypoxemia. This may require further intervention such as thoracentesis or surgical drainage.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has signs of fluid overload, including basilar crackles on examination and gross edema. This can increase the risk of heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics have been started but need careful monitoring due to the patient's worsening renal function.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, possibly due to over-diuresis or infection. Blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and fluid boluses may be required.
4. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and fever, suggesting an ongoing infectious process. Cultures have grown coag-negative staphylococcus, Acinetob"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and developed complications such as sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient has been experiencing persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, which may be due to infection, fluid overload, or decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved, and bronchoscopy and thoracentesis have been performed. The patient's condition requires close monitoring.
2. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there is concern for over-diuresis. The diuretics furosemide and Lasix have been held due to worsening renal function.
3. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and fever, likely related to a pulmonary etiology. The blood culture grew coag-negative staph from 03/31, which is considered a contaminant. The patient is currently on tobramycin and tigecycline. Klebsiella in the urine, resistant to tobramycin, has been identified, and sputum culture continues"

The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to over-diuresis, but they are still markedly fluid-positive with elevated JVP, suggesting possible infection or fluid overload. The patient's cardiac status includes a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. The patient is not currently anticoagulated.

The patient is anemic with a HCT of 23.1, despite receiving 1u PRBCs overnight. The INR is elevated at 2.1 for unclear reasons. There are no known liver disease, and the elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and borderline low fibrinogen are consistent with hemolysis versus disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine elevation from 0.8 to 1.8. The FE urea is 52.4, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as the likely etiology.

In terms of medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status.

Overall, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include hypoxemic respiratory failure, resistant infections, hypotension, anemia, acute renal failure, and cardiac issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held x36 hours. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. Would not continue
   diuresis given worsening renal function
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 94-127. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Likely secondary to over-diuresis, however patient still
   markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs infection, although
   lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   - titrated up metoprolol to 25mg po bid
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   - Continue tobramycin (day 13), tigecycline (day 14), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   -Continue ambisome (day 2) for presumed endovascular fungal infection
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input will discuss with
   ID antifungals, given that currently we are continuing aggressive
   treatment
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now diltiazem
   being held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension.
   - consider restarting lasix/diuril diuresis as BP tolerates
   - Continue amiodarone, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] po. Titrate up for HR control as BP
   tolerates.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 23.6
stable overnight.  Continues to be hypotensive, but
   no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.1 for unclear reasons. No known
   liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional. LDH elevated, haptoglobin low,
   fibrinogen borderline low, consistent with hemolysis vs. DIC.
   -check HCT [**Hospital1 **], transfuse to keep HCT>21
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox and ASA given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 1.8 to 2.4 overnight.
   Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the
   setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis. FE
   urea 52.4, suggesting ATN as likely etiology.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins

   Code status: DNR/DNI
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and is now in the ICU with several complications. The patient's current condition includes persistent leukocytosis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungal medications due to suspected infections. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. The patient is not currently anticoagulated and has been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation occurred on [**3-31**]. The patient's cardiac status is further complicated by moderate aortic regurgitation, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and has been treated with multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications. The presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the urine and Acinetobacter baumannii in the sputum indicates ongoing infections.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may be due to pneumonia or pleural effusions.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there are concerns about over-diuresis leading to intravascular depletion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of multiple medical complications. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has been experiencing persistent leukocytosis, and her condition has been worsening despite receiving various treatments. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with an elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. She also has an atrial fibrillation rhythm. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal the presence of a wound infection and possible cellulitis. The patient's overall condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent leukocytosis and worsening condition indicate a possible ongoing infection. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and is now on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Wound Infection: The presence of a wound infection increases the risk of developing cellulitis or deeper tissue infections. Inadequate source control or antibiotic therapy may lead to worsening of the infection and potentially systemic spread.

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held x36 hours. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. Would not continue
   diuresis given worsening renal function
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 84-116. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Restarted metoprolol. Likely secondary to over-diuresis,
   however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs
   infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   - titrated up metoprolol to 25mg po bid
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].  Ambisome
   was attempted for 3 days, however discontinued given worsening renal
   function.  ID has signed off.
   - Continue tobramycin (day 15), tigecycline (day 16), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now diltiazem
   being held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension.
   - continue to hold diuresis given worsening renal failure and
   hypotension
   - Continue amiodarone, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] po. Titrate up for HR control as BP
   tolerates.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 21.6 last night. Patient was transfused an additional
   unit.  AM HCT 25.1.  Continues to be hypotensive, but no active signs
   of bleeding. INR 1.9 for unclear reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**]
   be nutritional. LDH elevated, haptoglobin low, fibrinogen borderline
   low, consistent with hemolysis vs. DIC.
   -check HCT [**Hospital1 **], transfuse to keep HCT>21
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox and ASA given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated to 3.0.  Patient had dye
   loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the setting of dye load
   vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -speak with ID regarding whether tobramycin is necessary given
   nephrotoxicity
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 this AM. Slowly trending down over past 2 days.
   Patient is volume overloaded but intravascularly depleted.
   -hold free water in tube feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed post-operative complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin, and recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. The patient also has hypotension, anemia, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent leukocytosis and positive cultures for various bacteria suggest a possible ongoing infection. This can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's acute renal failure and potential involvement of other organs such as the heart and lungs, there is a risk of MODS, where multiple organ systems fail simultaneously.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support and recurrent pulmonary effusions indicate a risk of respiratory failure, which may necessitate continued mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy management.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-oper"

   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent
   sputum from [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of
   [**3-20**] sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive.
   Lasix gtt held. Though appears clinically overloaded, may be
   intravascularly depleted. Would not continue diuresis given worsening
   renal function
   - Complete abx course for pneumonia (see below)
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.

   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].  Ambisome
   was attempted for 3 days, however discontinued given worsening renal
   function.  ID has signed off.
   - Continue tobramycin (day 15 of 21).  Completed 3 week course of
   tigecycline. D/c vancomycin.
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs

   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now diltiazem
   being held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension.
   - continue to hold diuresis given worsening renal failure and
   hypotension
   - Continue amiodarone, statin
   - Dilt and metoprolol d/c

","The patient is a 73-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of CABG surgery. She has multiple complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She also has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, positive cultures for E. coli and Acinetobacter, and resistant Klebsiella in her urine. The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, fluid overload, and worsening renal function.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.8Â°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 86/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. She has a tracheostomy in place and is comfortable. Physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally on anterior exam, 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities, and lethargy.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 130 mEq/L. Other lab values include elevated lactate levels, low haptoglobin, and elevated LDH. Imaging studies show a small vegetation on echo, moderate aortic regurgitation, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CABG who developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement. She has been experiencing persistent leukocytosis despite being on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin. The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure with recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, positive cultures for E. coli and Acinetobacter baumannii, fluid overload, and worsening renal function. She has been hypotensive and has had a recent echo showing small vegetation, possibly fungal, no persistent bacteremia or fungemia. Ambisome was attempted but discontinued due to worsening renal function. The patient's cardiac history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated and has moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation on echo. Anemia with a HCT of 21.6 was noted, and the patient received an additional unit of blood. Her creatinine level is elevated to 3.0, possibly due to dye load or prerenal azotemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sternal wound infection: The patient's sternal wound has been draining, indicating an ongoing infection. This can lead to further complications if not adequately treated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent
   sputum from [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of
   [**3-20**] sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive.
   Lasix gtt held. Though appears clinically overloaded, may be
   intravascularly depleted. Would not continue diuresis given worsening
   renal function
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 84-116. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Restarted metoprolol. Likely secondary to over-diuresis,
   however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs
   infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   - titrated up metoprolol to 25mg po bid
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].  Ambisome
   was attempted for 3 days, however discontinued given worsening renal
   function.  ID has signed off.
   - Continue tobramycin (day 15), tigecycline (day 16), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now diltiazem
   being held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension.
   - continue to hold diuresis given worsening renal failure and
   hypotension
   - Continue amiodarone, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] po. Titrate up for HR control as BP
   tolerates.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 21.6 last night. Patient was transfused an additional
   unit.  AM HCT 25.1.  Continues to be hypotensive, but no active signs
   of bleeding. INR 1.9 for unclear reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**]
   be nutritional. LDH elevated, haptoglobin low, fibrinogen borderline
   low, consistent with hemolysis vs. DIC.
   -check HCT [**Hospital1 **], transfuse to keep HCT>21
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox and ASA given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated to 3.0.  Patient had dye
   loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the setting of dye load
   vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -speak with ID regarding whether tobramycin is necessary given
   nephrotoxicity
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 this AM. Slowly trending down over past 2 days.
   Patient is volume overloaded but intravascularly depleted.
   -hold free water in tube feeds

   Code status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is persistent leukocytosis. The patient has a history of CABG surgery, sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG. The patient presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of fluid overload, decompensation, and recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. The sputum cultures have grown E. coli and Acinetobacter baumannii, which are resistant to tobramycin. The patient also has Klebsiella pneumoniae in the urine, which is resistant to tobramycin. The patient's renal function is worsening, and the use of Ambisome has been discontinued due to this. The patient has anemia with a HCT of 21.6 and is being transfused. The patient also has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.0. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further infection due to resistant bacteria, worsening renal failure, and bleeding from the tracheostomy site."

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-28**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-20**]
   sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held x36 hours. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. Would not continue
   diuresis given worsening renal function
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 94-127. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Likely secondary to over-diuresis, however patient still
   markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs infection, although
   lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   - titrated up metoprolol to 25mg po bid
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-15**]
   WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   - Continue tobramycin (day 14), tigecycline (day 15), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   -Continue ambisome (day 3) for presumed endovascular fungal infection
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input will discuss with
   ID antifungals, given that currently we are continuing aggressive
   treatment
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now diltiazem
   being held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension.
   - consider restarting lasix/diuril diuresis as BP tolerates
   - Continue amiodarone, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] po. Titrate up for HR control as BP
   tolerates.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 23.6
stable overnight.  Continues to be hypotensive, but
   no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.1 for unclear reasons. No known
   liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional. LDH elevated, haptoglobin low,
   fibrinogen borderline low, consistent with hemolysis vs. DIC.
   -check HCT [**Hospital1 **], transfuse to keep HCT>21
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox and ASA given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 1.8 to 2.4 overnight.
   Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the
   setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis. FE
   urea 52.4, suggesting ATN as likely etiology.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and developed postoperative complications including a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented with bleeding from the tracheostomy site and recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. The patient's leukocyte count remains elevated despite receiving antibiotics (tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin), and she has been diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in her urine. Sputum cultures have grown Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli. The patient's renal function has worsened, and she is now on hemodialysis. Her cardiac status includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated. The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, and there are concerns of hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing hypotension and respiratory distress."

   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent
   sputum from [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of
   [**3-20**] sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**]. Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted
   4/28 per Cardiology recs with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient
   has been hypotensive and oliguric and lasix gtt has been discontinued.
   Though appears clinically overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted.
    CXR today with slightly improved aeration
   - Complete abx course for pneumonia (see below)
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.
   Possibly ATN in the setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of
   over diuresis. Ambisome d/c
d in setting of worsening renal failure.
   Creatinine elevated to 3.5 and almost anuric.  Potassium now 5.7
   despite kayexalate o.n.
   -d/w family goals of care as patient will soon need dialysis for renal
   failure/hyperkalemia
   -check Tobramycin level
   -continue to monitor Cr, UOP
   -avoid further nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 76-110. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Restarted metoprolol thereafter. Now holding metoprolol for
   hypotension. Likely secondary to over-diuresis, however patient still
   markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs infection, although
   lactate wnl, afebrile.
   - No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   - fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   - holding metoprolol
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew
   coag negative staph from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and
   tigecycline
 ID following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now
   with Klebsiella in urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture
   still growing Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx
   growing highly resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA
   growing 5-10 WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no
   persistent bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   Ambisome was attempted for 3 days, however discontinued given worsening
   renal function.  ID has signed off.  Wbc appears to be t
   - Continue tobramycin ([**4-12**]=day 16 of 21).  Completed 3 week course of
   tigecycline. D/c
d vancomycin.
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now diltiazem
   being held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension/worsening renal failure.
   - continue to hold diuresis given worsening renal failure and
   hypotension
   - Continue amiodarone, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   - Metoprolol currently held for hypotension.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 21.6 last night. Patient was transfused an additional
   unit.  AM HCT 25.1.  Continues to be hypotensive, but no active signs
   of bleeding. INR 1.9 for unclear reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**]
   be nutritional. LDH elevated, haptoglobin low, fibrinogen borderline
   low, consistent with hemolysis vs. DIC.
   -check HCT [**Hospital1 **], transfuse to keep HCT>21
   -d/c-ed lovenox and ASA given renal failure and anemia
   -continue active T&S
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 131 this AM. Slowly trended down, now stable since
   yesterday. Patient is volume overloaded but intravascularly depleted.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement. She presented with bleeding from the tracheostomy site and loculated left pleural effusion. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. She also has leukocytosis and fever, with cultures showing growth of coag-negative staphylococcus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and E. coli. The patient is currently on tobramycin and tigecycline. She has worsening sternal wound, and Ambisome was attempted but discontinued due to worsening renal function. The patient's cardiac history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated. The patient also has anemia with a low HCT and is being transfused. She has hyponatremia and is volume overloaded but intravascularly depleted. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sternal wound infection: The patient's sternal wound has shown signs of worsening, indicating a potential complication related to the surgical site infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure requires close monitoring and intervention to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CABG, who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and her sputum cultures have grown E.coli and Acinetobacter. The patient also has hypotension, likely secondary to over-diuresis, and acute renal failure. She has an elevated creatinine level and is almost anuric. The patient is also experiencing leukocytosis, fever, and a worsening sternal wound. She has been treated with tobramycin and tigecycline, but her urine culture is now growing highly resistant Klebsiella. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple medical issues including anemia, hyponatremia, and cardiac problems such as atrial fibrillation and moderate aortic regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent pulmonary effusions and positive cultures for E.coli and Acinetobacter indicate a persistent respiratory infection. This can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and anuria suggest acute renal failure. This is further supported by her history of dye loads for a CT scan and over-diuresis. If not addressed promptly, it can progress to end-stage renal disease.
3. Sternal Wound Infection: The patient's worsening sternal wound infection is concerning"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent CABG surgery and developed a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She presented with bleeding from her tracheostomy site and was found to have a loculated left pleural effusion and persistent leukocytosis.

She has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions with sputum cultures growing E. coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. The patient's renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 3.5. She also has hypotension, which may be secondary to over-diuresis or fluid overload. Her potassium level is elevated at 5.7.

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for suspected infections, including coag-negative staph, Acinetobacter baumannii, and E. coli. However, her condition has not improved, and she continues to have leukocytosis and fever.

She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated. Her cardiac status shows moderate aortic regurgitation, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's anemia is being managed with blood transfusions, and her sodium level has been corrected. She is receiving nutritional support through a feeding tube.

   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent
   sputum from [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of
   [**3-20**] sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive and
   oliguric and lasix gtt has been discontinued. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted.
   - Complete abx course for pneumonia (see below)
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy.

   # Acute renal failure: Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.
   Possibly ATN in the setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of
   over diuresis. Ambisome d/c

   Creatinine elevated to 3.5 and almost anuric.  Potassium now 5.7
   despite kayexalate o.n.

   growing highly resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA
   growing 5-10 WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no
   persistent bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   Ambisome was attempted for 3 days, however discontinued given worsening
   renal function.  ID has signed off.  Wbc appears to be t

   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent
   sputum from [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of
   [**3-20**] sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**]. Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted
   4/28 per Cardiology recs with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient
   has been hypotensive and oliguric and lasix gtt has since been
   discontinued. CXR today with slightly improved aeration left lung
   - Complete abx course for pneumonia (see below)
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.
   Possibly ATN in the setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of
   over diuresis. Ambisome d/c
d in setting of worsening renal failure.
   Creatinine continues to rise (3.5 today) and now almost anuric.
   Potassium now 5.7 despite kayexalate o/n.
   -d/w family goals of care as patient will soon need dialysis for renal
   failure/hyperkalemia
   -dosing tobramycin based on levels
   -continue to monitor Cr, UOP
   -avoid further nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 76-110. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Restarted metoprolol thereafter. Now holding metoprolol for
   hypotension. Patient was also on pressors for a short period of time
   but was weaned off. Likely secondary to over-diuresis and intravascular
   depletion, however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated
   JVP vs infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   - No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   - fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   - holding metoprolol
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew
   coag negative staph from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and
   tigecycline
 ID following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now
   with Klebsiella in urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture
   still growing Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx
   growing highly resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA
   growing 5-10 WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no
   persistent bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   Ambisome was attempted for 3 days, however discontinued given worsening
   renal function.  ID has signed off.
   - Continue tobramycin ([**4-12**]=day 16 of 21).  Completed 3 week course of
   tigecycline. D/c
d vancomycin.
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now being held
   in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded with echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension/worsening renal failure.
   - continue to hold diuresis given worsening renal failure and
   hypotension
   - Continue amiodarone, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   - Metoprolol currently held for hypotension.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 21.6 [**4-10**], given 1 u pRBCs. Stable this am at HCT 25.5.
   Continues to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 1.9
   for unclear reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional. LDH
   elevated, haptoglobin low, fibrinogen borderline low, consistent with
   hemolysis vs. DIC.
   -check HCT [**Hospital1 **], transfuse to keep HCT>21
   -d/c-ed lovenox and ASA given renal failure and anemia
   -continue active T&S
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 131 this AM. Slowly trended down, now stable since
   yesterday. Patient is volume overloaded but intravascularly depleted.
   -hold free water in tube feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and is now in the ICU. She has a history of sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and has been complicated by recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, fever, anemia, hyponatremia, and cardiac issues including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure. This could be due to the presence of pleural effusions, pneumonia, or other respiratory infections. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory status is necessary. Interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery may be required for repeat drainage of the left pleural effusion.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, possibly due to dye loads from recent CT scans, over-diuresis, or intravascular depletion. The patient's potassium levels are also elevated, and they will soon need dialysis for renal failure/hyperkalemia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent
   sputum from [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of
   [**3-20**] sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**]. Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted
   4/28 per Cardiology recs with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient
   has been hypotensive and oliguric and lasix gtt has since been
   discontinued.
   - Complete abx course for pneumonia (see below)
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.
   Possibly ATN in the setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of
   over diuresis. Ambisome d/c
d in setting of worsening renal failure.
   Creatinine continues to rise (4.1 today) and now almost anuric.
   Potassium now 6.0.
   -per family will not initiate dialysis
   -dosing tobramycin based on levels
   -continue to monitor Cr, UOP
   -avoid further nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 80-116. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Restarted metoprolol thereafter. Now holding metoprolol for
   hypotension. Patient was also on pressors for a short period of time
   but was weaned off. Likely secondary to over-diuresis and intravascular
   depletion, however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated
   JVP vs infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   - No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   - fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   - holding metoprolol
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew
   coag negative staph from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and
   tigecycline
 ID following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now
   with Klebsiella in urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture
   still growing Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx
   growing highly resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA
   growing 5-10 WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no
   persistent bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   Ambisome was attempted for 3 days, however discontinued given worsening
   renal function.  ID has signed off.  Afebrile.
   - Continue tobramycin ([**4-13**]=day 17 of 21).  Completed 3 week course of
   tigecycline. D/c
d vancomycin.
   -reconsult optho [**4-22**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now being held
   in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded with echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension/worsening renal failure.
   - continue to hold diuresis given worsening renal failure and
   hypotension
   - Continue amiodarone, statin
   - Dilt and metoprolol d/c
d for hypotension.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 21.6 [**4-10**], given 1 u pRBCs. This am 24.7.  Continues to be
   hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 1.9 for unclear
   reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional. LDH elevated,
   haptoglobin low, fibrinogen borderline low, consistent with hemolysis
   vs. DIC.
   -check HCT [**Hospital1 **], transfuse to keep HCT>21
   -d/c-ed lovenox and ASA given renal failure and anemia
   -continue active T&S
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 131 this AM. Slowly trended down, now stable since
   yesterday. Patient is volume overloaded but intravascularly depleted.
   -hold free water in tube feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who is currently in the ICU for several health issues. She has a history of CABG surgery that was complicated by sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, fluid overload, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient also has leukocytosis and fever, with previous cultures growing coag-negative staph, Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, and now Klebsiella pneumoniae. She has a worsening sternal wound and is not receiving dialysis per family request. Her cardiac status includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial fibrillation post-operatively. She is not currently anticoagulated. She has anemia with a HCT of 21.6, and her sodium level is low at 131. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions with cultures growing Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli. She is currently on tobramycin and tigecycline for suspected infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has worsening renal function with a rising creatinine level of 4.1 and almost anuric urine output. This could be due to dye load, over-diuresis, or prerenal causes.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She has since been complicated by a sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient presents with bleeding from her tracheostomy site, a loculated left pleural effusion, and persistent leukocytosis. She is now experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to dye load from a recent CT scan or overdiuresis. Her creatinine levels are rising, and she is almost anuric with a potassium level of 6.0. The family has declined dialysis. 

The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure with recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions. Sputum cultures have grown E. coli and Acinetobacter, which are resistant to tobramycin. There is evidence of fluid overload with gross edema and basilar crackles on examination. Thoracic and interventional pulmonology services have been involved, but they do not plan for repeat drainage of the left pleural effusion. 

The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to overdiuresis and intravascular depletion. Her blood pressure is unstable, ranging from 80-116 systolic. Metoprolol has been held due to hypotension, and she was previously on pressors"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis now with renal failure.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.
   Possibly ATN in the setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of
   over diuresis. Ambisome d/c
d in setting of worsening renal failure.
   Creatinine continues to rise (4.1 yesterday) and now almost anuric.
   Potassium 6.0. Goals of care directed toward comfort. Given no plan for
   dialysis, will not check renal function further.
   -per family will not initiate dialysis
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent
   sputum from [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of
   [**3-20**] sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**]. Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted
   4/28 per Cardiology recs with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient
   has been hypotensive and oliguric and lasix gtt has since been
   discontinued.
   - continue current vent settings
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy.
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 87-125. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Restarted metoprolol thereafter. Now holding metoprolol for
   hypotension. Patient was also on pressors for a short period of time
   but was weaned off. Likely secondary to over-diuresis and intravascular
   depletion, however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated
   JVP vs infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   - No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   - holding metoprolol
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew
   coag negative staph from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and
   tigecycline
 ID following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now
   with Klebsiella in urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture
   still growing Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx
   growing highly resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA
   growing 5-10 WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no
   persistent bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   Ambisome was attempted for 3 days, however discontinued given worsening
   renal function.  ID has signed off.  Afebrile.
   - D/c
d tobramycin given worsening renal failure.  Completed 3 week
   course of tigecycline. D/c
d vancomycin.
   .
    # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now being held
   in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded with echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension/worsening renal failure.
   - continue to hold diuresis given worsening renal failure and
   hypotension
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control
   - Dilt and metoprolol d/c
d for hypotension.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 21.6 [**4-10**], given 1 u pRBCs. Yesterday HCT 24.7.  Continues
   to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 1.9 for unclear
   reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional. LDH elevated,
   haptoglobin low, fibrinogen borderline low, consistent with hemolysis
   vs. DIC. No further lab draws.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Slowly trended down, now stable. Patient is volume
   overloaded but intravascularly depleted. No further lab draws, so will
   not follow.
   .
   # Coccygeal decubitus ulcer: Continue local wound care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and developed complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She has persistent leukocytosis, renal failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, and multiple infections caused by resistant bacteria such as E.coli, Acinetobacter, and Klebsiella. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient has worsening renal function with increasing creatinine levels and oliguria, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to factors such as dye load from imaging studies, overdiuresis, or prerenal causes. Dialysis is not planned as per family wishes, and the focus is on comfort care.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and positive cultures for E.coli and Acinetobacter. She requires ventilatory support, and interventions like bronchoscopic drainage and thoracentesis have been performed. However, her condition remains critical, and further aggressive interventions may not be feasible.

3. Hypotension: The patient experiences episodes of hypotension, which may be attributed to overdiuresis, intravascular depletion, or sepsis. Vasopressors have been used temporarily but"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis now with renal failure.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.
   Possibly ATN in the setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of
   over diuresis. Ambisome d/c
d in setting of worsening renal failure.
   Creatinine continues to rise (4.1 yesterday) and now almost anuric.
   Potassium 6.0. Goals of care directed toward comfort. Given no plan for
   dialysis, will not check renal function further.
   -per family will not initiate dialysis
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent
   sputum from [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of
   [**3-20**] sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**]. Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted
   4/28 per Cardiology recs with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient
   has been hypotensive and oliguric and lasix gtt has since been
   discontinued.
   - continue current vent settings
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy.
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs 87-125. Diltiazem and metoprolol
   d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Restarted metoprolol thereafter. Now holding metoprolol for
   hypotension. Patient was also on pressors for a short period of time
   but was weaned off. Likely secondary to over-diuresis and intravascular
   depletion, however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated
   JVP vs infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   - No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   - holding metoprolol
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew
   coag negative staph from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and
   tigecycline
 ID following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-25**], 23, 26).  Now
   with Klebsiella in urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture
   still growing Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx
   growing highly resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA
   growing 5-10 WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no
   persistent bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   Ambisome was attempted for 3 days, however discontinued given worsening
   renal function.  ID has signed off.  Afebrile.
   - D/c
d tobramycin given worsening renal failure.  Completed 3 week
   course of tigecycline. D/c
d vancomycin.
   .
    # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now being held
   in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded with echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension/worsening renal failure.
   - continue to hold diuresis given worsening renal failure and
   hypotension
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control
   - Dilt and metoprolol d/c
d for hypotension.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 21.6 [**4-10**], given 1 u pRBCs. Yesterday HCT 24.7.  Continues
   to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 1.9 for unclear
   reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional. LDH elevated,
   haptoglobin low, fibrinogen borderline low, consistent with hemolysis
   vs. DIC. No further lab draws.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Slowly trended down, now stable. Patient is volume
   overloaded but intravascularly depleted. No further lab draws, so will
   not follow.
   .
   # Coccygeal decubitus ulcer: Continue local wound care.

   Disposition:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and has been in the ICU since then. She has multiple complications including sternal wound infection, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube, bleeding from tracheostomy site, loculated left pleural effusion, persistent leukocytosis, renal failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, and anemia. She has been on various medications and treatments, but her condition continues to deteriorate. The patient's family has declined dialysis, and her goals of care are directed towards comfort. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been rising, indicating worsening renal function. This could be due to dye loads from a recent CT scan or over-diuresis. Given the patient's anuria and potassium level of 6.0, it is important to manage her renal failure carefully.

2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions and has been ventilator-dependent since February. She has been growing E. coli and Acinetobacter in her sputum cultures, which are resistant to some antibiotics. The patient is likely experiencing fluid overload, as indicated by her gross edema and basilar crackles on examination.

3. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with persistent leukocytosis and has been experiencing a range of health issues. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 103 bpm), hypotension (blood pressure of 88/47 mmHg), and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but there is evidence of edema in the extremities. 

The patient's review of systems reveals no significant changes except for decreased bowel sounds at the bases. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on various medications including codeine, tobramycin, famotidine, hydromorphone, and lorazepam.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 16.5 to 20.9 thousand cells per microliter. The hemoglobin level is low at 8.0 g/dL, and the platelet count varies between 74 and 147 thousand cells per microliter. Renal function tests indicate acute renal failure with a creatinine level increasing from 1.7 to 4.1 mg/dL. Other lab results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers.

The patient's medical complications include ineffective coping, impaired skin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes renal failure, hyperkalemia, decubitus ulcer, acute anemia due to blood loss, wound dehiscence, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a DNR/I (do not resuscitate/intubate) order. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/50 mmHg to 125/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications including hydromorphone (Dilaudid), lorazepam (Ativan), and tobramycin. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose levels, and elevated potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges or show no significant changes. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and no neurological assessment due to encephalopathy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, further electrolyte imbalances, infection due to decubitus ulcer or wound deh"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis now with renal failure.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had dye loads last week for CT scan.
   Possibly ATN in the setting of dye load vs prerenal in the setting of
   over diuresis. Ambisome d/c
d in setting of worsening renal failure.
   Creatinine continues to rise (4.1 yesterday) and now almost anuric.
   Potassium 6.0. Goals of care directed toward comfort. Given no plan for
   dialysis, will not check renal function further.
   -per family will not initiate dialysis
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-20**]. Recent
   sputum from [**3-28**], [**3-31**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of
   [**3-20**] sample. [**3-31**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**4-2**], CXR [**4-7**]. Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted
   4/28 per Cardiology recs with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient
   has been hypotensive and oliguric and lasix gtt has since been
   discontinued.
   - continue current vent settings
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy.
   .
   # Hypotension: Overnight systolic BPs in the 70
s. Diltiazem and
   metoprolol d/c
d  [**4-6**]. Restarted metoprolol thereafter. Now holding
   metoprolol for hypotension. Patient was also on pressors for a short
   period of time but was weaned off. Likely secondary to over-diuresis
   and intravascular depletion, however patient still markedly fluid
   positive with elevated JVP vs infection, although lactate wnl,
   afebrile.
   - No further diuresis given worsening renal failure
   - holding metoprolol
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew
   coag negative staph from [**3-31**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and
   tigecycline
   with Klebsiella in urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture
   still growing Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-31**], despite abx.  UCx
   growing highly resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA
   growing 5-10 WBCs. Echo [**4-6**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no
   persistent bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**4-8**].
   Ambisome was attempted for 3 days, however discontinued given worsening
   renal function.
   - D/c
d tobramycin given worsening renal failure.  Completed 3 week
   course of tigecycline. D/c
d vancomycin.
   .
    # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-31**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now being held
   in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded with echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. However this is being held in the
   setting of hypotension/worsening renal failure.
   - continue to hold diuresis given worsening renal failure and
   hypotension
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control
   - Dilt and metoprolol d/c

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and has been experiencing multiple complications since then. The patient's current conditions include acute renal failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis with fever, cardiac issues including atrial fibrillation, anemia, hyponatremia, and a coccygeal decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, which may be due to dye load from a recent CT scan or over-diuresis. This could lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for dialysis.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent left-sided pulmonary effusions, likely contributing to her respiratory failure. This can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, leading to further respiratory distress.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low systolic blood pressures indicate hypotension, which may be related to over-diuresis and intravascular depletion. This can compromise tissue perfusion and lead to organ dysfunction.
4. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and fever, suggesting an ongoing infection. This could be due to the pulmonary etiology or other sources of infection. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated promptly.
5. Cardiac Issues: The patient"
