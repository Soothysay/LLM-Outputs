   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of LDH, lipase, amylase, and leukocytosis with a bandemia. He also has thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications. 

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely due to alcohol abuse. His Ranson score suggests a 16% mortality rate. He will need pain control with morphine, serial abdominal exams, and nutritional support through IV fluids or enteral feeds.

2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension has resolved after IV fluids administration. He should continue to be monitored for any signs of recurrent hypotension, and his vital signs should be trending.

3. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's chronic alcohol abuse history, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal. He should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms and receive Valium as per the CIWA scale. Thiamine and folate supplementation should also be provided.

4. Decreased bicarbonate: The patient's decreased bicarbonate levels may be due to alcohol ketoacidosis. He should continue to be monitored, and"

   Disposition:
","The patient in the ICU is presenting with acute pancreatitis, as indicated by the elevated levels of amylase and lipase. The patient also has a history of alcohol abuse, which is a common cause of acute pancreatitis. Additionally, the patient is experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 122 beats per minute and low blood pressure ranging from 94/54 to 154/101 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is at 96%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen support.

The patient's laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, along with elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT). The platelet count (Plt) is slightly low, and the creatinine (Cr) level is within normal range. The blood glucose level is elevated at 163 mg/dL. The electrolyte levels, including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4), are all within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 7602 mL, including 1462 mL of fluids given during the past 24 hours. The output includes 1553 mL of blood products, 1018 mL of urine, and 380 mL of stool. The net fluid balance is positive at 6049 mL.

The patient has multiple lines in place, including a 22-gauge and a 20-gauge line inserted on 05/23/2141. The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient is also receiving nutrition support.

Given the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, development of infections due to the presence of lines and the patient's immunocompromised state, and ongoing pancreatic inflammation leading to organ failure. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and fluid balance is crucial to manage these potential complications."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presented with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. His Ranson score suggests a low mortality rate, likely due to alcohol-related pancreatitis. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation. His laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with bandemia, elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia. Other lab abnormalities include hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's condition is being managed with pain control using morphine, IV fluid support, NPO status, and serial abdominal exams. His hypotension has resolved after receiving IV fluids. The healthcare team is monitoring for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and providing appropriate medications as needed. They are also keeping a close eye on his kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood glucose levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay, he may be at risk for developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and it is important to monitor for signs of withdrawal, which can include seizures, delirium tremens, and other"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient's laboratory results indicate several abnormalities including elevated lactate levels, low hemoglobin concentration, high white blood cell count with bandemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and medications for pain control, and a nasogastric tube has been placed for enteral feeding. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and interventions have been implemented to address various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest acute pancreatitis. If left untreated or complicated by infected pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation, this condition can lead to sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension may be due to hypovolemia secondary to fluid loss from vomiting. If not adequately managed, it can progress to shock and organ failure.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's chronic history of alcohol abuse, there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms, which can range from mild anxiety and tremors to severe complications such as seizures and delirium trem"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presented with acute pancreatitis and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 109/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. He is intubated with an endotracheal tube.

The patient has a pain score of 6-15 on a scale of 0-10 and experiences episodes of anxiety. His abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present but is distended. There is no evidence of peripheral edema or cyanosis.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.2 K/uL, elevated amylase and lipase levels, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 95 mg/dL, hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 163 mg/dL, and metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate level of 14 mEq/L.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he has hypovolemia due to reduced PO intake. There is concern for possible sepsis, although likely SIRS. Monitoring BP and maintaining MAP >60 mmHg is essential.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presents with symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis, possibly related to his alcohol consumption. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. His laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, acidosis, and elevated levels of amylase and lipase. The patient is currently receiving fluid resuscitation and pain management. Concerns include the possibility of sepsis, pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient is critically ill and will continue to be monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count could indicate an infection, which may progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Pulmonary edema: The presence of crackles on examination and the plan to monitor a chest X-ray suggest concern for pulmonary edema, which could be caused by fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation of 94% on room air indicates potential hypoxia, which may require supplemental oxygen or more aggressive respiratory support.
4. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of chronic alcohol abuse and current abstinence, there is a risk of developing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens (DTs).
5. Pancreatitis complications: Acute"

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient has a Ranson score of 3 at 48 hours, indicating a 16% mortality rate. However, her APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk of around 3%. The causes of pancreatitis are alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides. 

The patient's lipase levels have been trending downward over the past three days, although this does not correlate with severity. Her hematocrit (HCT) has decreased from 38 to 25, which may indicate ongoing blood loss or fluid shifts. Pain control is being provided with morphine.

The patient's hypoxia is initially attributed to pulmonary edema. However, despite having a net negative fluid balance and an improved chest X-ray, the patient is in greater distress. This suggests alternative causes for the hypoxia, which need to be investigated. An electrocardiogram (EKG), cardiac enzymes, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) have been ordered to assess cardiac function. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the torso may be considered if the patient can tolerate lying flat, as it can evaluate for pulmonary embolism (PE) as well as hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Diuresis will be continued, and close"

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presented with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including potential pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe malnutrition, anemia, alcohol withdrawal, transaminase elevation, hyponatremia, leukocytosis with bandemia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's medical history and current condition suggest multiple potential medical complications that need to be addressed. These include managing the underlying pancreatitis, addressing the respiratory failure, providing nutrition support, monitoring for alcohol withdrawal, evaluating the cause of anemia, treating the electrolyte imbalances, and investigating the cause of leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia.

Based on the provided information, it is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Frequent assessment of fluid balance and ongoing monitoring of laboratory values such as complete blood count, liver function tests, electrolytes, and blood cultures are also crucial.

The patient requires aggressive management with appropriate pain control, respiratory support, nutritional repletion, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring for complications such as infection, bleeding, and cardiac dysfunction is essential. Regular reassessment and modification of the treatment plan based on the patient's response will be necessary.

   # Pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality rate.
   APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Her Lipase was downtrending over three days, though
   this does not correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to
   25. Her respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3^rd
   spacing with edema vs ARDS)
   - pain control with morphine
   - Follow HCT, CRP levels
   - provide IVF support
   - NJ tube placement to start enteral feeds VS TPN if patient cannot
   tolerated
   - serial abdominal exams
   .
   # hypoxia
 Initially attributed to pulmonary edema.  This AM patient
   in greater distress despite having a net negative fluid balance and
   improved CXR. Worried about ARDS vs PE.
   - EKG, cardiac enzymes
   - TTE to assess cardiac function
   - hold CTA as patient has difficulty lying flat at this time; if that
   improves or if patient intubated, could consider CTA torso (to eval for
   PE, as well as hemorrhagic pancreatitis)
   - continue diuresis
   - close monitoring

   # Severe malnutrition: protein-energy component (low albumin) but
   mainly manifest in severe calcium, phosphorous deficiencies

   - aggressive lytes repletion
   - thiamine, folate

   # Anemia: likely chronic and acute. Chronic: likely alcoholic
   myelosuppression with mixed iron/foltate deficiency (RDW > 20). Acute
   hydration and dilution with blood loss
   - guaiac stool
   - active T+S
   - low threshold to rescan abdomen for hemorrhagic conversion
   .
   # alcohol abuse: given chronic history and underlying seizure disorder
   will need to be vigilant in watching for withdrawal
   - valium per CIWA scale
   - IV MVI/thiamine/folate
   - continue to monitor for withdrawal symptoms.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. Her APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk of approximately 3%. The cause of her pancreatitis is likely alcohol-related, with gallstones being unlikely given the negative radiography. The patient's Lipase levels have been trending downward over the past three days, although this does not correlate with severity. Her hematocrit (HCT) has fallen from 38 to 25, indicating a significant drop in red blood cell count. 

The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which could be due to third spacing with edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pain control has been provided with morphine, and the patient's condition will be closely monitored. 

The patient also has severe malnutrition, evident from low albumin levels, calcium, and phosphorous deficiencies. Nutritional support through total enteral nutrition (TEN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) will be provided if the patient cannot tolerate enteral feeds. 

Anemia is likely chronic and acute, with potential causes including alcohol-related myelosuppression, iron/folate deficiency, blood loss, and hydration/dilution. 

The patient's transaminase levels are elevated, which could be due to alcohol-induced liver damage or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with possible overlap"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. Her APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk. The cause of her pancreatitis is likely alcohol-related, but gallstones and elevated triglycerides are also possible causes. Her lipase levels have been trending downwards over the past three days. She is experiencing severe malnutrition, mainly due to calcium and phosphorus deficiencies. The patient also has anemia, likely due to chronic alcohol abuse and mixed iron/folate deficiency. There is a decreased bicarbonate level, which could be related to alcohol ketoacidosis. Her transaminase levels are elevated, possibly due to alcohol-induced liver damage or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) overlap. She has fatty infiltration on CT. The patient is also experiencing hyponatremia, leukocytosis with bandemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely due to alcohol abuse. Complications associated with pancreatitis include infected pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, biliary obstruction, and systemic complications such as sepsis.
2. Malnutrition: The patient's severe malnutrition increases the risk of complications related to poor wound healing, infections, and impaired immune function.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yof EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder present with findings
   c/w pancreatitis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Initial suspicion for pulmonary edema
   (cardiogenic).  However, although initial f/u CXR demonstrated some
   interval improvement following net diuresis, subsequent CXR
   demonstrated bilateral progression.  Concern for evolving
   non-cardiogenic pulmoanry edema (i.e. ARDS) in context of acute
   pancreatitis.  Also consider infection, apparently normal host.
   Consider viral pneumonia, less likely opportunistic infection.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, SaO2.  Plan bronchoscopy
   to assess airways, perform BAL for microbiological specimens.  Check
   ECG, cardiac enzymes.  Check cardiac echo for RV/LV function.  CT angio
   to assess for pulmonary embolism (persistent tachycardia).
   HYPOTENSION -- Hypovolemia, reduced PO intake.  Concern for possible
   sepsis, although likely SIRS.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PANCREATITIS -- acute, related to EtOH and/or lipidemia.  Low mortality
   category.  Continue current level of management (fluids, pain
   management).  Monitor amylase, lipase.  Surgery now off case.  Plan
   image ABD ct to assess for bleeding.
   DYSPNEA -- attributed to pulmonary edema, probable cardiogenic (volume
   resusitation) rather than non-cardiogenic (LV failure).  Doubt
   pulmonary embolism.  Tolerating net diuresis, CXR improved today.
   Check ECG, cardiac enzymes, cardiac echo.  Component of anxiety.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body depleted, clinically.  Plan check serum
   osmolality, urine osmolality.  Monitor serial Na.
   ACIDOSIS -- HCO3  improved, with repletion.  Non-gap, with ABG
   consistent with metabolic acidosis.
   ANEMIA -- progressive, despite net negative fliud balance.  Concern
   include intraabdominal bleed --> consider repeat ABD CT if continues to
   decline.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- Resolved.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Last consumption 5 days ago, need to monitor
   for evidence of withdrawal (DTs).
   LFT abnormality
 attributed to EtOH.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS --  Marked volume resusitation.  Plan net diuresis (lasix) to
   treat pulmonary edema.  Monitor I/O, BP, urine output.
   ANXIETY -- continue usual meds.

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder who presented with acute pancreatitis, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. The patient remains dyspneic and has experienced a progressive clinical decline despite net diuresis. He was intubated this afternoon for tachypnea and describes flank pain. The patient has been placed on a feeding tube in anticipation of initiating total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.7°F), a heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/73 mmHg to 133/89 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 88% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, PaO2 of 48 mmHg, and HCO3- of 26 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and mild distress. There are no signs of conjunctival edema or scleral icterus. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI), regular rhythm, and no murmurs. The respiratory examination reveals crackles at the bilateral lung bases.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yof EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder present with findings
   c/w pancreatitis.
   HYPOTENSION -- Hypovolemia, reduced PO intake.  Concern for possible
   sepsis, although likely SIRS.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PANCREATITIS -- acute, related to EtOH and/or lipidemia.  Low mortality
   category.  Continue current level of management (fluids, pain
   management).  Monitor amylase, lipase.  Surgery now off case.
   DYSPNEA -- attributed to pulmonary edema, probable cardiogenic (volume
   resusitation) rather than non-cardiogenic (LV failure).  Doubt
   pulmonary embolism.  Tolerating net diuresis, CXR improved today.
   Check ECG, cardiac enzymes, cardiac echo.  Component of anxiety.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body depleted, clinically.  Plan check serum
   osmolality, urine osmolality.  Monitor serial Na.
   ACIDOSIS -- HCO3  improved, with repletion.  Non-gap, with ABG
   consistent with metabolic acidosis.
   ANEMIA -- progressive, despite net negative fliud balance.  Concern
   include intraabdominal bleed --> consider repeat ABD CT if continues to
   decline.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- Resolved.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Last consumption 5 days ago, need to monitor
   for evidence of withdrawal (DTs).
   LFT abnormality
 attributed to EtOH.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS --  Marked volume resusitation.  Plan net diuresis (lasix) to
   treat pulmonary edema.  Monitor I/O, BP, urine output.
   ANXIETY -- continue usual meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He is currently admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis, hypoxemia, and tachycardia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure of 117/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient is intubated and on a non-rebreather mask. Physical examination findings include mild distress, cervical lymphadenopathy, and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated amylase and lipase levels, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and possible sepsis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count, there is a concern for sepsis. Monitoring of vital signs and further investigations such as blood cultures and antibiotic administration would be necessary.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The presence of hypoxemia and bibasilar crackles raises the possibility of ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status, along with consideration"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 YOF with EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder present with
   findings c/w pancreatitis and hypotension.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality rate.
   APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Her Lipase was downtrending over three days, though
   this does not correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to
   25. Her respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3^rd
   spacing with edema vs ARDS)
   - pain control with morphine
   - Follow HCT, CRP levels
   - provide IVF support
   - NJ tube placement to start enteral feeds VS TPN if patient cannot
   tolerated
   - serial abdominal exams
   .
   # hypoxia
 Initially attributed to pulmonary edema.  This AM patient
   in greater distress despite having a net negative fluid balance and
   improved CXR. Worried about ARDS vs PE.
   - EKG, cardiac enzymes
   - TTE to assess cardiac function
   - hold CTA as patient has difficulty lying flat at this time; if that
   improves or if patient intubated, could consider CTA torso (to eval for
   PE, as well as hemorrhagic pancreatitis)
   - continue diuresis
   - close monitoring
   .
   # Severe malnutrition: protein-energy component (low albumin) but
   mainly manifest in severe calcium, phosphorous deficiencies
   - TEN or TPN if cannot tolerate
   - aggressive lytes repletion
   - thiamine, folate
   .
   # Anemia: likely chronic and acute. Chronic: likely alcoholic
   myelosuppression with mixed iron/foltate deficiency (RDW > 20). Acute
   hydration and dilution with blood loss
   - guaiac stool
   - active T+S
   - low threshold to rescan abdomen for hemorrhagic conversion
   .
   # alcohol abuse: given chronic history and underlying seizure disorder
   will need to be vigilant in watching for withdrawal
   - valium per CIWA scale

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient's APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk, but she has fallen HCT from 38 to 25. Her respiratory failure could be a complication of either third spacing with edema or ARDS. The patient's current conditions include severe malnutrition, anemia, alcohol abuse, transaminitis, hyponatremia, leukocytosis with bandemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, trans thoracic echo, bronchoscopy, PICC line, arterial line, and receiving IV fluids. The plan includes pain control with morphine, following HCT and CRP levels, providing IVF support, placing an NJ tube for enteral feeds or TPN if tolerated, serial abdominal exams, EKG, cardiac enzymes, TTE to assess cardiac function, holding CTA as patient has difficulty lying flat, close monitoring, aggressive lytes repletion, thiamine, folate, guaiac stool, active T+S, and monitoring for withdrawal symptoms."

   findings c/w pancreatitis and hypotension.
   .
   # hypoxia
 Initially attributed to pulmonary edema.  This AM patient
   in greater distress despite having a net negative fluid balance and
   improved CXR. Worried about ARDS vs PE. CTA negative for PE, EKG and CE
   negative for MI, TTE negative for CHF, serial CXR in the setting of
   diuresis confirms ARDS. Pa02/FiO2 is 116.  The cause of her ARDS is
   either pancreatitis or infection
   - Vent Day 1 = [**5-24**], ARDSNET protocol
   - place esophageal balloon
   - f/u final CTA
   - F/u bronch cultures
   - check HIV when consentable
   - sedation is an issue
 maxed on versed
 trying haldol and
   considering ketamine if persistent
   .
   # Pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality rate.
   APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Her Lipase was downtrending over three days, though
   this does not correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to
   25. Her respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3^rd
   spacing with edema vs ARDS)
   - pain control with morphine
   - Follow HCT, CRP levels
   - provide IVF support
   - NJ tube placement to start enteral feeds VS TPN if patient cannot
   tolerated
   - holding Meropenem for ppx of necrotizing pancreatitis
   - serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Severe malnutrition: protein-energy component (low albumin) but
   mainly manifest in severe calcium, phosphorous deficiencies
   - TEN or TPN if cannot tolerate
   - aggressive lytes repletion
   - thiamine, folate
   .
   # Anemia: likely chronic and acute. Chronic: likely alcoholic
   myelosuppression with mixed iron/foltate deficiency (RDW > 20). Acute
   hydration and dilution with blood loss
   - guaiac stool
   - active T+S
   - low threshold to rescan abdomen for hemorrhagic conversion
   .
   # alcohol abuse: given chronic history and underlying seizure disorder
   will need to be vigilant in watching for withdrawal
   - valium per CIWA scale
   - IV MVI/thiamine/folate
   - continue to monitor for withdrawal symptoms.
   .
   # Transaminits: likely alcohol induced (AST/ALT [**3-13**]), but could also be
   NASH/[**Doctor Last Name **] overlap +/- fibrosis. If [**Doctor Last Name **], not severe given normal INR and
   bilirubin. She has fatty infiltration on CT
   - just trend for now.
   .
   # hyponatremia: hypovolemic hyponatremia given n/v, will trend; likely
   will resolve after IVF.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - IVF support target 2-3L
   .
   # leukocytosis with bandemia: likely due to the underlying
   pancreatitis, will need to trend.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with severe acute pancreatitis. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, which initially was attributed to pulmonary edema. However, despite a negative fluid balance and improved chest X-ray, the patient remains in greater distress. The cause of her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection. She has been placed on the ARDSNET protocol and an esophageal balloon has been placed. Further evaluation with a final CTA and bronch cultures is planned. The patient's HCT has fallen from 38 to 25, and her respiratory failure could be a complication of pancreatitis or ARDS. Pain control with morphine, follow-up of HCT and CRP levels, provision of IVF support, and placement of an NJ tube for enteral feeding are part of the plan. The patient also has severe malnutrition, anemia, alcohol abuse, transaminitis, hyponatremia, leukocytosis with bandemia, and thrombocytopenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be a complication of pancreatitis or ARDS. Close monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation may be required.
2. Infection: Given the presence of fever and the potential for infection in a critically ill patient, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated.

   42 YOF with EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder present with
   findings c/w pancreatitis and hypotension.
   .
   # hypoxia/ARDS
 Initially attributed to pulmonary edema.  This AM
   patient in greater distress despite having a net negative fluid balance
   and improved CXR. Worried about ARDS vs PE. CTA negative for PE, EKG
   and CE negative for MI, TTE negative for CHF, serial CXR in the setting
   of diuresis confirms ARDS. Pa02/FiO2 is 116.  The cause of her ARDS is
   either pancreatitis or infection
   - Vent Day 1 = [**5-24**], ARDSNET protocol
   - place esophageal balloon
   - f/u final CTA
   - F/u bronch cultures
   - check HIV when consentable
   - sedation is an issue
 maxed on versed
 trying haldol and
   considering ketamine if persistent
   .
   # Pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality rate.
   APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Her Lipase was downtrending over three days, though
   this does not correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to
   25. Her respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3^rd
   spacing with edema vs ARDS)
   - pain control with morphine
   - Follow HCT, CRP levels
   - provide IVF support
   - NJ tube placement to start enteral feeds VS TPN if patient cannot
   tolerated
   - holding Meropenem for ppx of necrotizing pancreatitis
   - serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Severe malnutrition: protein-energy component (low albumin) but
   mainly manifest in severe calcium, phosphorous deficiencies
   - TEN or TPN if cannot tolerate
   - aggressive lytes repletion
   - thiamine, folate
   .
   # Anemia: likely chronic and acute. Chronic: likely alcoholic
   myelosuppression with mixed iron/foltate deficiency (RDW > 20). Acute
   hydration and dilution with blood loss
   - guaiac stool
   - active T+S
   - low threshold to rescan abdomen for hemorrhagic conversion
   .
   # alcohol abuse: given chronic history and underlying seizure disorder
   will need to be vigilant in watching for withdrawal
   - valium per CIWA scale
   - IV MVI/thiamine/folate
   - continue to monitor for withdrawal symptoms.
   .
   # Transaminits: likely alcohol induced (AST/ALT [**3-13**]), but could also be
   NASH/[**Doctor Last Name **] overlap +/- fibrosis. If [**Doctor Last Name **], not severe given normal INR and
   bilirubin. She has fatty infiltration on CT
   - just trend for now.
   .
   # hyponatremia: hypovolemic hyponatremia given n/v, will trend; likely
   will resolve after IVF.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - IVF support target 2-3L
   .
   # leukocytosis with bandemia: likely due to the underlying
   pancreatitis, will need to trend.
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: could be due alchohol related myelosupression,

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presented with findings consistent with severe acute pancreatitis, but without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or hemorrhage conversion. There is extensive peripancreatic free fluid, and marked bowel wall thickening of the duodenum from adjacent inflammation. The patient also has ileus of the transverse colon, small bilateral pleural effusions, diffuse ground glass opacities, areas of consolidation, and diffuse fatty liver.

The patient was intubated and went for computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the torso, which revealed no pulmonary embolus. She is currently on invasive ventilation, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and bronchoscopy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.2°F, heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/67 to 141/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. She is receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions, as well as other medications such as lasix, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with bandemia, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes,"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yof EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder present with findings
   c/w pancreatitis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Attributed predominatly to non-cardiogenic
   pulmoanry edema (i.e. ARDS) in context of acute pancreatitis.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, lung protective strategy, PEEP.  Consider
   esophgeal balloon.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Atrributed to hypovolemia, reduced PO
   intake.  Concern for possible sepsis, although likely SIRS.  Monitor
   BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PANCREATITIS -- acute, related to EtOH and/or lipidemia.  Elevated
   mortality category.  Continue current level of management (fluids, pain
   management).  Monitor amylase, lipase.  Surgery now off case.  ABD CT
   without evidence for bleeding.  Consider Meropenem empirically.
   FEVER
 attributed in part to acute pancreatitis.  Monitor closely,
   remains off antimicrobials.  Low threshold for iniating antimicrobials.
   DYSPNEA -- attributed to pulmonary edema, probable non-cardiogenic (LV
   failure).  Doubt pulmonary embolism.  Tolerating net diuresis, CXR
   improved today.   Check ECG, cardiac enzymes, cardiac echo.  Component
   of anxiety.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body Na depleted, clinically.  Plan check serum
   osmolality, urine osmolality.  Monitor serial Na.
   ACIDOSIS -- HCO3  improved, with repletion.  Non-gap, with ABG
   consistent with metabolic acidosis.
   ANEMIA
 intially progressive, despite net negative fliud balance. No
   evidence for intraabdominal bleed.  Transfuse to maintain Hct >21.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- Resolved.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Last consumption 5 days ago, need to monitor
   for evidence of withdrawal (DTs).
   LFT abnormality
 attributed to EtOH.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS --  Marked volume resusitation.  TOlerated net diuresis (lasix)
   to treat pulmonary edema.  Monitor I/O, BP, urine output.  Need to
   balance desire to keep hypovolemic (ARDS) and sufficient intravascular
   hydration (acute pancreatitis and third spacing)
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.
   ANXIETY -- continue iv benzodiazepine.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presented with respiratory failure attributed to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS) in the context of acute pancreatitis. 

The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated, requiring high FiO2 and high doses of sedation. His vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, which have since resolved. The patient also has hypoxia, hyperglycemia, and anemia.

The assessment and plan include continuing mechanical ventilation with a lung protective strategy, monitoring for sepsis, managing acute pancreatitis, monitoring amylase and lipase levels, considering an esophageal balloon, and starting empiric antibiotics.

Other issues noted in the progress note include fever, dyspnea, hyponatremia, acidosis, lactic acidosis, EtOH abuse, and liver function test abnormalities. The patient has been tolerating tube feeds and has had marked volume resuscitation with net diuresis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and risk factors, there is a concern for possible sepsis. Monitoring for signs of infection and maintaining strict infection control measures will be important.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has been receiving significant fluid resuscitation, which may increase the"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yof EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder present with findings
   c/w pancreatitis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Attributed predominatly to non-cardiogenic
   pulmoanry edema (i.e. ARDS) in context of acute pancreatitis.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, lung protective strategy, PEEP.  Consider
   esophgeal balloon.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Atrributed to hypovolemia, reduced PO
   intake.  Concern for possible sepsis, although likely SIRS.  Monitor
   BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PANCREATITIS -- acute, related to EtOH and/or lipidemia.  Elevated
   mortality category.  Continue current level of management (fluids, pain
   management).  Monitor amylase, lipase.  Surgery now off case.  ABD CT
   without evidence for bleeding.  Consider Meropenem empirically.
   FEVER
 attributed in part to acute pancreatitis.  Monitor closely,
   remains off antimicrobials.  Low threshold for iniating antimicrobials.
   DYSPNEA -- attributed to pulmonary edema, probable non-cardiogenic (LV
   failure).  Doubt pulmonary embolism.  Tolerating net diuresis, CXR
   improved today.   Check ECG, cardiac enzymes, cardiac echo.  Component
   of anxiety.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body Na depleted, clinically.  Plan check serum
   osmolality, urine osmolality.  Monitor serial Na.
   ACIDOSIS -- HCO3  improved, with repletion.  Non-gap, with ABG
   consistent with metabolic acidosis.
   ANEMIA
 intially progressive, despite net negative fliud balance. No
   evidence for intraabdominal bleed.  Transfuse to maintain Hct >21.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- Resolved.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Last consumption 5 days ago, need to monitor
   for evidence of withdrawal (DTs).
   LFT abnormality
 attributed to EtOH.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS --  Marked volume resusitation.  TOlerated net diuresis (lasix)
   to treat pulmonary edema.  Monitor I/O, BP, urine output.  Need to
   balance desire to keep hypovolemic (ARDS) and sufficient intravascular
   hydration (acute pancreatitis and third spacing)
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.
   ANXIETY -- continue iv benzodiazepine.

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder who presented with respiratory failure attributed to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS) in the context of acute pancreatitis. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, requiring high FiO2 and high doses of sedation. His vital signs include a temperature of 39.6°C, heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure of 131/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.3 K/uL, slightly elevated HCT at 30.7%, and normal platelet count at 88 K/uL. Blood glucose levels have been stable between 87-104 mg/dL. Liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are slightly elevated, while troponin-T levels remain below 0.01 ng/mL. The patient's serum electrolytes show hyponatremia with a Na level of 95 mEq/L and metabolic acidosis with a HCO3- level of 26 mEq/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing mechanical ventilation with a lung protective strategy and PEEP, considering an esophageal balloon, and monitoring amylase and lipase levels for pancreatitis. The patient's hypotension has resolved, but there is concern for possible se"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presents with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), pancreatitis, severe malnutrition, anemia, alcohol abuse, transaminitis, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia. She is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation, IV fluids, and medications for pain control, sedation, and prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient is already experiencing ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure and difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, leading to complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
3. Malnutrition: The patient's severe malnutrition increases the risk of delayed wound healing, infections, and impaired immune function.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may further deteriorate, leading to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and potential organ dysfunction.
5. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's chronic alcohol abuse history, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can manifest with symptoms like agitation, tremors, seizures, and delirium tremens.
6. Infection: The patient is at"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient was initially treated for hypoxia/ARDS, which was initially attributed to pulmonary edema but confirmed as ARDS. The cause of ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection. The patient's severe pancreatitis is classified as an alcohol-related pancreatitis with an Ranson score of 3 and an APACHE II score suggesting a lower mortality risk of around 3%. The patient's respiratory failure could be a complication of severe pancreatitis or ARDS. 

The patient also has severe malnutrition, likely due to chronic alcohol abuse, presenting with low albumin levels. Anemia is present, which is likely chronic and acute in nature. The patient requires vigilant monitoring for alcohol withdrawal. Transaminitis is present, which could be alcohol-induced or related to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hyponatremia persists despite IVF rescue, and thrombocytopenia could be due to alcohol-related myelosuppression, hemodilution, drug effect, or splenomegaly.

Potential Medical Complications:

   .
   # hypoxia/ARDS
 Initially attributed to pulmonary edema.  This AM
   patient in greater distress despite having a net negative fluid balance
   and improved CXR. Worried about ARDS vs PE. CTA negative for PE, EKG
   and CE negative for MI, TTE negative for CHF, serial CXR in the setting
   of diuresis confirms ARDS. Pa02/FiO2 is 116.  The cause of her ARDS is
   either pancreatitis or infection. Massive improvement by [**5-26**].
   - Vent Day 1 = [**5-24**], ARDSNET protocol
   - place esophageal balloon
   - f/u final CTA
   - F/u bronch cultures
   - check HIV when consentable
   - sedation is an issue
 maxed on versed
 trying haldol and
   considering ketamine if persistent
   .
   # Pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality rate.
   APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Her Lipase was downtrending over three days, though
   this does not correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to
   25. Her respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3rd
   spacing with edema vs ARDS)
   - pain control with morphine
   - Follow HCT, CRP levels, not lipase
   - provide IVF support
   - NJ tube placement to start enteral feeds VS TPN if patient cannot
   tolerated
   - holding Meropenem for ppx of necrotizing pancreatitis
   - serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Severe malnutrition: protein-energy component (low albumin) but
   mainly manifest in severe calcium, phosphorous deficiencies
   - TEN or TPN if cannot tolerate
   - aggressive lytes repletion
   - thiamine, folate
   .
   # Anemia: likely chronic and acute. Chronic: likely alcoholic
   myelosuppression with mixed iron/foltate deficiency (RDW > 20). Acute
   hydration and dilution with blood loss. Blood loss over night on [**5-25**]
   is very difficult to explain in the absence of hemolysis
   - guaiac stool
   - active T+S
   - low threshold to rescan abdomen for hemorrhagic conversion
   .
   # alcohol abuse: given chronic history and underlying seizure disorder
   will need to be vigilant in watching for withdrawal
   - valium per CIWA scale
   - IV MVI/thiamine/folate
   - continue to monitor for withdrawal symptoms.
   .
   # Transaminits: likely alcohol induced (AST/ALT [**3-13**]), but could also be
   NASH/[**Doctor Last Name **] overlap +/- fibrosis. If [**Doctor Last Name **], not severe given normal INR and
   bilirubin. She has fatty infiltration on CT
   - just trend for now.

   # hyponatremia: hypovolemic hyponatremia given n/v, will trend; likely
   will resolve after IVF.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - IVF support target 2-3L

   # leukocytosis with bandemia: likely due to the underlying
   pancreatitis, will need to trend.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues. 

1. Fever: The patient experienced a fever of 103.6°F on the evening of [**2141-5-25**]. She was started on Haldol for sedation, and insufficient cells were available for viral culture of bronchial samples. BAL results were negative for PJP, Legionella, and AFB. Her Hct fell to 20.6, and she received two units of blood.

2. Respiratory Support: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 116, indicating severe hypoxia. The cause of her ARDS could be either pancreatitis or infection. She is being managed according to the ARDSNET protocol.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a high Ranson score for pancreatitis, suggesting a high mortality rate. Causes of pancreatitis include alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides. Her lipase levels are trending downward, but this does not correlate with severity. Her hematocrit (Hct) has fallen from 38% to 25%. Her respiratory failure could be a complication of pancreatitis (third spacing with ed"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yof EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder presents now with
   acute pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS. Demonstrating evidence for
   clinical improvement over past 12 hours.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Attributed predominatly to ARDS in context of
   acute pancreatitis.  Radiographic and clinical improvement.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, lung protective strategy, PEEP.  Hold esophgeal
   balloon.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PANCREATITIS -- acute, related to EtOH and/or lipidemia.  Elevated
   mortality category.  Continue current level of management (fluid
   mangement, pain management).  Monitor amylase, lipase.  Surgery now off
   case.  ABD CT without evidence for bleeding.  Consider Meropenem
   empirically esp if evidence for necrotizing pancreatitis.
   FEVER
 attributed in part to acute pancreatitis.  Monitor closely,
   remains off antimicrobials.  Low threshold for iniating antimicrobials.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body Na depleted, clinically.  Plan check serum
   osmolality, urine osmolality.  Monitor serial Na.
   ACIDOSIS -- HCO3  improved, with repletion.
   ANEMIA
 intially progressive, despite net negative fliud balance. No
   evidence for intraabdominal bleed.  Transfuse to maintain Hct >21.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- Resolved.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Last consumption 5 days ago, need to monitor
   for evidence of withdrawal (DTs).
   LFT abnormality
 attributed to EtOH.  Monitor.
   LDH ELEVATION -- attributed in part to lung injury. Monitor.
   FLUIDS --  Marked volume resusitation.  Tolerated net diuresis (lasix)
   to treat pulmonary edema.  Monitor I/O, BP, urine output.  Need to
   balance desire to keep hypovolemic (ARDS) and sufficient intravascular
   hydration (acute pancreatitis and third spacing).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.
   ANXIETY -- continue iv benzodiazepine.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presents with acute pancreatitis and respiratory failure attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. He exhibits anemia but has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion. His fever has resolved, and he shows clinical improvement over the past 12 hours. The patient has hypotension, pancreatitis, hyponatremia, acidosis, and lactic acidosis. He also has chronic ethanol abuse, liver function test abnormalities, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient is receiving nutritional support and various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may lead to further respiratory failure if not adequately managed with mechanical ventilation and lung-protective strategies.
2. Pancreatitis Complications: The patient's acute pancreatitis may progress to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or infected pancreatic necrosis, which can be life-threatening.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension needs to be closely monitored and managed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia requires careful management to prevent osmotic imbalance and neurological complications.
5. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis needs correction to maintain proper pH balance and prevent complications related to tissue hypoperfusion.
6. Lactic Acidosis: Resolution of lactic acidosis is essential to ensure proper tissue oxygenation and prevent further organ damage.
7. Ethanol Withdrawal: As the patient has a history of chronic ethanol abuse, monitoring for signs and symptoms of withdrawal, including delirium tremens (DTs), is crucial.
8. Infection: Given the patient's critical condition and immunosuppressed state, there is a high risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
9. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid management requires careful monitoring to avoid both fluid overload and hypovolemia, as both can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or renal dysfunction.
10. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's reliance on enteral nutrition may lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients if not properly managed.

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and prompt management of these potential complications are necessary to improve his prognosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yof EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder presents now with
   acute pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS. Demonstrating evidence for
   clinical improvement over past 12 hours.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Attributed predominatly to ARDS in context of
   acute pancreatitis.  Radiographic and clinical improvement.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, lung protective strategy, PEEP.  Hold esophgeal
   balloon.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PANCREATITIS -- acute, related to EtOH and/or lipidemia.  Elevated
   mortality category.  Continue current level of management (fluid
   mangement, pain management).  Monitor amylase, lipase.  Surgery now off
   case.  ABD CT without evidence for bleeding.  Consider Meropenem
   empirically esp if evidence for necrotizing pancreatitis.
   FEVER
 attributed in part to acute pancreatitis.  Monitor closely,
   remains off antimicrobials.  Low threshold for iniating antimicrobials.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body Na depleted, clinically.  Plan check serum
   osmolality, urine osmolality.  Monitor serial Na.
   ACIDOSIS -- HCO3  improved, with repletion.
   ANEMIA
 intially progressive, despite net negative fliud balance. No
   evidence for intraabdominal bleed.  Transfuse to maintain Hct >21.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- Resolved.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Last consumption 5 days ago, need to monitor
   for evidence of withdrawal (DTs).
   LFT abnormality
 attributed to EtOH.  Monitor.
   LDH ELEVATION -- attributed in part to lung injury. Monitor.
   FLUIDS --  Marked volume resusitation.  Tolerated net diuresis (lasix)
   to treat pulmonary edema.  Monitor I/O, BP, urine output.  Need to
   balance desire to keep hypovolemic (ARDS) and sufficient intravascular
   hydration (acute pancreatitis and third spacing).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.
   ANXIETY -- continue iv benzodiazepine.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presented with acute pancreatitis and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS has been attributed to acute pancreatitis. Continuing mechanical ventilation with a lung protective strategy and maintaining PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) is essential.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure has been resolved, but it should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, possibly related to ethanol abuse and/or lipidemia. Fluid management and pain control should continue, and amylase and lipase levels should be monitored. Surgery has been ruled out for now, and meropenem may be considered empirically if there is evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis.

4. Fever: The patient's fever may be attributed to acute pancreatitis. Monitoring for any signs of infection is crucial, and a low threshold for initiating antimicrobials should be maintained.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which may be due to total body sodium depletion. Serum osmolality and urine osmolality"

   # hypoxia/ARDS
 Initially attributed to pulmonary edema.  CTA negative
   for PE, EKG and CE negative for MI, TTE negative for CHF, serial CXR in
   the setting of diuresis confirms ARDS. Pa02/FiO2 was 116.  The cause of
   her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection. Massive improvement by
   [**5-26**].
   - Vent Day 1 = [**5-24**], ARDSNET protocol
   - follow compliance, Pa/FiO2
   - change vent to pressure support, wean down sedation.
   .
   # Severe pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality
   rate.  APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Her Lipase was downtrending over three days, though
   this does not correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to
   25. Her respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3rd
   spacing with edema vs ARDS).
   - pain control with fentanyl
   - Follow HCT, CRP levels, not lipase
   - provide IVF support
   - enteral feeding with NJ tube

   mainly manifest in severe calcium, phosphorous deficiencies
   - aggressive lytes repletion
   - thiamine, folate
   - enteric feed her
   .
   # anemia: likely chronic and acute. Chronic: likely alcoholic
   myelosuppression with mixed iron/foltate deficiency (RDW > 20). Acute
   hydration and dilution with blood loss. Blood loss over night on [**5-25**]
   is very difficult to explain in the absence of hemolysis
   - guaiac stool (need bowel regimen)
   - active T+S; transfuse Hct < 21; trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - low threshold to rescan abdomen for hemorrhagic conversion
   - question if she needs to be reimaged.
   .
   # alcohol abuse: given chronic history and underlying seizure disorder
   will need to be vigilant in watching for withdrawal
   - continue MVI/thiamine/folate

   On this day I examined this patient and was present for the key
   portions of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7709**]
s note
   above and agree with his findings and plan of care.  Ms [**Known lastname 11909**] is
   very ill with pancreatitis, ARDS, alcoholism, prior hypotension,
   ongoing fevers, rising WBC,  falling HCT, persistent tachycardia, and
   new UTI.  Her pulmonary infiltrates have definitely improved and her
   PEEP is down to 5. Her VE is under 10L and I think she can be tried on
   PSV.  Her persistent fevers largely explain her tachycardia and  we
   will start Cipro for her UTI and hope to reverse WBC and temps. If not,
   then a search for other sources (eg lungs, abdomen) will be
   undertaken.  She is comfortable and somnolent, so we wlll reduce
   Fentanyl a bit today.  40min spent in the care of this critically ill
   patient.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with severe pancreatitis, alcohol-related myelosuppression, UTI, severe malnutrition, anemia, and transaminitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was attributed to pulmonary edema, but further evaluation confirmed ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). This is a serious condition that can lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Infection: The patient has developed a UTI (urinary tract infection) indicated by fever and a dirty urine analysis. It is important to monitor and treat this infection promptly to prevent it from spreading or causing sepsis.

3. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which can be a sign of sepsis or shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status is essential to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

4. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's chronic history of alcohol abuse, there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms, including seizures or delirium tremens. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal and providing appropriate management is crucial.

5. Malnutrition: The patient has severe malnutrition, characterized by low albumin levels and deficiencies in calcium and phosphorus. Nutritional support should be initiated to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presented with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. She was found to have ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), severe pancreatitis, a urinary tract infection (UTI), severe malnutrition, anemia, alcohol abuse, transaminitis, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates severe hypoxia, which can lead to complications such as respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction.
2. Severe pancreatitis: This condition can progress to necrotizing pancreatitis, leading to complications like abscess formation, infected pancreatic necrosis, or systemic infection.
3. UTI: If left untreated, the infection may progress to pyelonephritis or sepsis.
4. Severe malnutrition: The patient's low albumin levels indicate protein-energy malnutrition. Without proper nutrition support, she may develop further complications related to malnutrition.
5. Anemia: Chronic anemia can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia. Acute blood loss may result in hemorrhagic shock.
6. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's chronic history of alcohol abuse, there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms, including seizures or delirium tremens.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 YOF with EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder present with
   findings c/w pancreatitis and hypotension.
   .
   # hypoxia/ARDS
 Initially attributed to pulmonary edema.  CTA negative
   for PE, EKG and CE negative for MI, TTE negative for CHF, serial CXR in
   the setting of diuresis confirms ARDS. Pa02/FiO2 was 116.  The cause of
   her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection. Massive improvement by
   [**5-26**].
   - Vent Day 1 = [**5-24**], ARDSNET protocol
   - follow compliance, Pa/FiO2
   .
   # Severe pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality
   rate.  APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Her Lipase was downtrending over three days, though
   this does not correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to
   25. Her respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3rd
   spacing with edema vs ARDS).
   - pain control with fentanyl
   - Follow HCT, CRP levels, not lipase
   - provide IVF support
   - enteral feeding with NJ tube
   - holding Meropenem for ppx of necrotizing pancreatitis
   - serial abdominal exams
   .
   # severe malnutrition: protein-energy component (low albumin) but
   mainly manifest in severe calcium, phosphorous deficiencies
   - TEN or TPN if cannot tolerate
   - aggressive lytes repletion
   - thiamine, folate
   .
   # anemia: likely chronic and acute. Chronic: likely alcoholic
   myelosuppression with mixed iron/foltate deficiency (RDW > 20). Acute
   hydration and dilution with blood loss. Blood loss over night on [**5-25**]
   is very difficult to explain in the absence of hemolysis
   - guaiac stool
   - active T+S; transfuse Hct < 21; trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - low threshold to rescan abdomen for hemorrhagic conversion
   - question if she needs to be reimaged.
   .
   # alcohol abuse: given chronic history and underlying seizure disorder
   will need to be vigilant in watching for withdrawal
   - valium per CIWA scale
   - IV MVI/thiamine/folate
   - continue to monitor for withdrawal symptoms.
   .
   # transaminitis: likely alcohol induced (AST/ALT [**3-13**]), but could also
   be NASH/[**Doctor Last Name **] overlap +/- fibrosis. If [**Doctor Last Name **], not severe given normal INR
   and bilirubin. She has fatty infiltration on CT
   - trend
   .
   # hyponatremia
 Persists after initial IVF rescue.
   - trend
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: could be due alchohol related myelosupression,
   hemodilution given fluid, other drug effect or splenomegaly.  -
   continue to trend

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient was initially attributed with hypoxia/ARDS, which was initially thought to be due to pulmonary edema. However, further evaluation including CTA, EKG, CE, and TTE ruled out PE, MI, and CHF. Serial CXR confirmed ARDS, and the cause of ARDS is suspected to be either pancreatitis or infection.

The patient also has severe pancreatitis with an Ranson score of 3 at 48 hours, indicating a 16% mortality rate. Her APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk of around 3%. The causes of pancreatitis are likely alcohol abuse, gallstones (though unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides. Her lipase levels have been downtrending over three days, but this does not correlate with severity.

Other medical complications and concerns include severe malnutrition, anemia (chronic and acute), alcohol abuse with potential withdrawal, transaminitis, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current plan includes pain control with fentanyl, following HCT and CRP levels, providing IVF support, enteral feeding with an NJ tube, holding meropenem for prophylaxis of necrotizing pancreatitis, serial abdominal exams,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including severe pancreatitis, severe malnutrition, anemia, alcohol abuse, transaminitis, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Pancreatitis: The patient has a high Ranson score indicating a severe case of pancreatitis with a mortality rate of 16%. Complications may include necrotizing pancreatitis, infected pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially presented with hypoxia/ARDS, which improved significantly. However, there is a risk of recurrence or development of new lung complications due to ongoing inflammation or infection.
3. Severe Malnutrition: The patient has a protein-energy malnutrition component, mainly manifesting in severe calcium and phosphorus deficiencies. This increases the risk of poor wound healing, infections, and other nutritional deficiencies.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic and acute anemia, likely due to alcohol-related myelosuppression, blood loss, and possible hemorrhagic conversion of pancreatitis. Blood loss needs to be monitored closely, and appropriate transfusions should be administered.
5. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient"

 Initially attributed to pulmonary edema.  CTA negative
   for PE, EKG and CE negative for MI, TTE negative for CHF, serial CXR in
   the setting of diuresis confirms ARDS. Pa02/FiO2 was 116.  The cause of
   her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection. Massive improvement by

   # Severe pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality
   rate.  APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Her Lipase was downtrending over three days, though
   this does not correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to
   25. Her respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3rd
   spacing with edema vs ARDS).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient initially developed hypoxia/ARDS, which was initially attributed to pulmonary edema but later confirmed to be ARDS. The cause of ARDS is suspected to be either pancreatitis or infection. The patient was started on the ARDSNET protocol, placed on contact precautions, and given broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient also has severe pancreatitis, as indicated by an Ranson score of 3 at 48 hours with a mortality rate of 16%. The cause of pancreatitis is likely alcohol-related, although gallstones are unlikely given negative radiography. The patient's lipase levels are trending downwards, but this does not correlate with severity. Her hematocrit (HCT) has fallen from 38 to 25, and her respiratory failure could be a complication of severe pancreatitis.

Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI), which was noted through a dirty urine analysis. Empiric treatment with ciprofloxacin was initiated. The patient also has severe malnutrition, with a protein-energy malnutrition component and deficiencies in calcium and phosphorus. Aggressive electrolyte repletion and enteral feeding are being provided.

Furthermore, the patient has anemia, which is likely chronic and acute. The chronic component may be due to alcoholic myelos"

   triglycerides.  Her Lipase was downtrending over three days, though

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She presents with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with ARDS, severe pancreatitis, UTI, severe malnutrition, anemia, alcohol abuse, transaminitis, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia. She is currently being treated with various medications and interventions, including IVF, enteric feed, bowel regimen, prophylactic heparin, and H2 blocker. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is likely due to pancreatitis or infection, as confirmed by negative CTA for PE, EKG and CE for MI, TTE for CHF, and serial CXR showing ARDS.
2. Severe Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis with an Ranson score of 3 at 48 hours, indicating a mortality rate of 16%. The cause of pancreatitis is likely alcohol-induced, although gallstones are unlikely given negative radiography.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a dirty urine culture suggestive of a UTI, which is being treated with ciprofloxacin.
4. Malnutrition: The patient has severe malnutrition, evident from low albumin levels and"

   On this day I examined Ms [**Known lastname 11909**] and was present for the key
   portion of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7709**]
s note above
   and agree with his findings and plan of care. Today she has not only
   continued with high fevers, but has leukocytosis and purulent lower
   resp secretions (with GPC and GNR), and also has multifocal infiltrates
   on CXR consistent with VAP. We have thus commenced Vanc and Cefepime in
   addition to Cipro, till culture results known.   She seems very sedated
   on vent, and with a rather benign abdomen (though distended), so I
   would favor decreasing narcotics. With new infiltrates and fevers,
   weaning off vent is on hold.  She
s receiving appropriate  feedings and
   seems euvolemic clinically and with normal renal function.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient initially had hypoxia/ARDS, which was initially attributed to pulmonary edema. However, further investigations ruled out pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. Serial chest X-rays confirmed the diagnosis of ARDS. The cause of her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection. The patient was placed on the ARDSNET protocol and started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient also has severe pancreatitis with a Ranson score of 3 at 48 hours, indicating a mortality rate of 16%. Her APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk of around 3%. The causes of her pancreatitis are alcohol abuse, gallstones (although this is unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides. The patient's Lipase levels were trending down over three days, although this does not correlate with severity. Her Hematocrit (HCT) has fallen from 38% to 25%. Her respiratory failure could be a complication (third spacing with edema versus ARDS).

   Assessment and Plan
   42 YOF with EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder present with
   findings c/w pancreatitis and hypotension.
   .
   # hypoxia/ARDS
 Initially attributed to pulmonary edema.  CTA negative
   for PE, EKG and CE negative for MI, TTE negative for CHF, serial CXR in
   the setting of diuresis confirms ARDS. Pa02/FiO2 was 116.  The cause of
   her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection. Massive improvement by
   [**5-26**].  Subsequently developed fever, multi-lobular pna (GPR,GPC,GNR).
   - Vent Day 1 = [**5-24**], ARDSNET protocol
   - on vanco/cefepime/ciprio (day 1 = [**5-28**])
   - resent sputum cultures, contact precautions
   - follow compliance, Pa/FiO2
   - change vent to pressure support, wean down sedation.
   .
   # Severe pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality
   rate.  APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Her Lipase was downtrending over three days, though
   this does not correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to
   25. Her respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3rd
   spacing with edema vs ARDS).
   - pain control with fentanyl
   - Follow HCT, CRP levels, not lipase
   - provide IVF support
   - enteral feeding with NJ tube
   - holding Meropenem for ppx of necrotizing pancreatitis
   - serial abdominal exams
   .
   # UTI: fever noted and found to have a dirty UA, likely UTI.
   - f/u Ucx
   - change foley
   - empiric treat with ciproflox
   .
   # severe malnutrition: protein-energy component (low albumin) but
   mainly manifest in severe calcium, phosphorous deficiencies
   - aggressive lytes repletion
   - thiamine, folate
   - enteric feed
   .
   # anemia: likely chronic and acute. Chronic: likely alcoholic
   myelosuppression with mixed iron/foltate deficiency (RDW > 20). Acute
   hydration and dilution with blood loss. Blood loss over night on [**5-25**]
   is very difficult to explain in the absence of hemolysis
   - guaiac stool (need bowel regimen)
   - active T+S; transfuse Hct < 21; trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - low threshold to rescan abdomen for hemorrhagic conversion
   - question if she needs to be reimaged.
   .
   # alcohol abuse: given chronic history and underlying seizure disorder
   will need to be vigilant in watching for withdrawal
   - continue MVI/thiamine/folate
   .
   # transaminitis: likely alcohol induced (AST/ALT [**3-13**]), but could also
   be NASH/[**Doctor Last Name **] overlap +/- fibrosis. If [**Doctor Last Name **], not severe given normal INR
   and bilirubin. She has fatty infiltration on CT
   - trend
   .
   # hyponatremia
 Persists after initial IVF rescue.
   - trend
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: could be due alchohol related myelosupression,
   hemodilution given fluid, other drug effect or splenomegaly.
   - continue to trend

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient initially had hypoxia/ARDS, which was initially attributed to pulmonary edema but confirmed as ARDS. The cause of ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection.

The patient developed fever, multi-lobular pneumonia (GPR, GPC, GNR), and was placed on ventilatory support with ARDSNET protocol. Antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin) were started, and sputum cultures were sent. Contact precautions were implemented, and compliance with the ventilator and Pa/FiO2 levels were monitored.

The patient also has severe pancreatitis with an Ranson score of 3 at 48 hours, indicating a 16% mortality rate. The cause of pancreatitis is likely alcohol and elevated triglycerides. The patient's HCT has fallen from 38 to 25, and her respiratory failure could be a complication of severe pancreatitis or ARDS.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a dirty urine culture, and empiric treatment with ciprofloxacin was initiated. The patient is severely malnourished, with protein-energy malnutrition and deficiencies in calcium and phosphorous. Aggressive electrolyte repletion, enteral feeding, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. She initially developed hypoxia/ARDS, which was initially attributed to pulmonary edema but confirmed to be ARDS due to pancreatitis or infection. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 improved from 116 to 169 today. She is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient also has severe pancreatitis with an APACHE II score suggesting a lower mortality risk. The causes of pancreatitis are alcohol abuse, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to 25, and her respiratory failure could be a complication of severe pancreatitis or ARDS.

Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a dirty urinary analysis and growth of E. coli. She is being empirically treated with ciprofloxacin.

The patient also has severe malnutrition with protein-energy malnutrition and deficiencies in calcium and phosphorus. She requires aggressive electrolyte repletion, thiamine, folate, and enteric feeding.

Furthermore, the patient has anemia, likely chronic and acute, possibly due to alcoholic myelosuppression, mixed iron"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues. The patient has a history of alcoholic pancreatitis, ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), and is currently intubated. 

The patient's recent events include persistent fever, positive sputum culture, and concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheal aspiration, or residual infection. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation is at 100%. The patient's neurological status is not assessed due to intubation.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.6 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels show hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, which are being repleted.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications include acute respiratory failure with persistent fever and concerns for VAP, acute pancreatitis, an E. coli urinary tract infection being treated with ciprofloxacin, leukocytosis/persistent fever of unclear source, hypocalcemia/hypophosphatemia, and alcohol withdrawal.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their multiple organ dysfunction and potential complications."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), initially attributed to pulmonary edema. Subsequent investigations ruled out pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and subsequent chest X-rays confirmed ARDS. The cause of ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection.

The patient's fever and positive urine culture indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI), likely caused by E. coli. Empiric treatment with ciprofloxacin has been initiated.

The patient also has severe pancreatitis, as evidenced by an Ranson score of 3 at 48 hours, with a mortality rate of 16%. Her APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk of approximately 3%. The causes of severe pancreatitis are alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides.

The patient's malnutrition is characterized by protein-energy malnutrition and deficiencies in calcium and phosphorous. Aggressive electrolyte repletion, thiamine, folate supplementation, and enteral feeding are recommended.

Anemia is likely chronic and acute, possibly due to alcohol myelosuppression, mixed iron/folate deficiency, and dilutional effects. Blood transfusion is being considered for a hematocrit (Hct) below 21%.

The patient's transaminitis is likely alcohol-induced but could also be due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) overlap +/- fibrosis. Fatty infiltration on CT suggests a possible liver condition.

Thrombocytopenia may be due to alcohol-related myelosuppression, hemodilution, drug effects, or splenomegaly.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Infection: Given the presence of ARDS and pancreatitis, the patient is at risk of developing further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or secondary bloodstream infections.

2. Pancreatitis complications: The patient may develop local or systemic complications related to pancreatitis, including abscess formation, pseudocyst, or pancreatic necrosis.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress to severe respiratory failure, requiring increased ventilatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

4. Multiorgan dysfunction: Severe pancreatitis can lead to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, affecting the kidneys, liver, and other organs.

5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and ongoing enteral feeding may result in deficiencies in essential nutrients, leading to further complications.

6. Bleeding: Thrombocytopenia and potential coagulopathy due to liver dysfunction may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if the patient requires invasive procedures or blood transfusions.

7. Alcohol withdrawal: Considering the patient's history of alcohol abuse and hospitalization, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can present with symptoms such as tremors, seizures, hallucinations"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The initial cause of her acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was attributed to pulmonary edema, but subsequent investigations ruled out pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. Serial chest X-rays confirmed the diagnosis of ARDS. The patient's ARDS is massive improved but she developed a fever, worrisome for pneumonia. She was initially treated with cefepime and ciprofloxacin and vancomycin was discontinued on the 29th. Her sputum culture grew oropharyngeal flora and H. influenzae.

Assessment and Plan:
1. ARDS: The patient has shown significant improvement in her PaO2/FiO2 ratio from 116 to 169 today. Ventilation strategy should focus on lowering tidal volumes while maintaining adequate oxygenation. Follow compliance with ARDSNET protocol, change vent to pressure support, and wean down sedation.
2. Severe pancreatitis: The patient's APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk of ~3%. Causes of pancreatitis include alcohol abuse, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides. Lipase levels have rapidly downtrended, although this does not correlate with severity. Monitor hematocrit (HCT) levels, CRP"

   # hypoxia/ARDS/Multifocal pneumonia
 Initially attributed to pulmonary
   edema.  CTA negative for PE, EKG and CE negative for MI, TTE negative
   for CHF, serial CXR in the setting of diuresis confirms ARDS. Initial
   Pa02/FiO2 was 116.  The cause of her ARDS is either pancreatitis or
   infection. Massive improvement by [**5-26**].  Subsequently developed fever
   worrisome for PNA. IBW = 53.6 kg.

   # Severe pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality
   rate.  APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Lipase rapidly downtrended, though this does not
   correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to 25.  Her
   respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3rd spacing with
   edema vs ARDS).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient initially experienced hypoxia/ARDS/Multifocal pneumonia, which was initially attributed to pulmonary edema. However, further evaluation, including a CT angiogram (CTA) negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), an electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac enzyme (CE) negative for myocardial infarction (MI), and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) negative for congestive heart failure (CHF), confirmed the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Serial chest X-rays in the setting of diuresis also confirmed ARDS. The cause of her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in ARDS and multifocal pneumonia. She has been receiving antibiotics, specifically cefepime/ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin has been discontinued.

The patient also has severe pancreatitis, as indicated by a Ranson score of 3 at 48 hours with a mortality rate of 16%. Her APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk of around 3%. The causes of her pancreatitis are alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides. Lipase levels have rapidly decreased, although"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient initially developed hypoxia/ARDS/Multifocal pneumonia, which was initially attributed to pulmonary edema. However, a computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac enzyme (CE) were negative for myocardial infarction (MI), and transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) was negative for congestive heart failure (CHF). Serial chest X-rays confirmed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The cause of her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection. 

The patient has been treated with cefepime/ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, but sputum culture was positive for oropharyngeal flora and H. influenzae. She has been weaned off sedation and her ARDS and multifocal pneumonia are improving. 

Additionally, the patient has severe pancreatitis with an Ranson score of 3 at 48 hours, which corresponds to a 16% mortality rate. Her APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk of around 3%. The causes of her pancreatitis are alcohol abuse, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yof EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder presents now with
   acute pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS. Continues to demonstrate
   evidence for clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Attributed predominatly to ARDS in context of
   acute pancreatitis.  Radiographic and clinical improvement last week,
   but now with evidence for pneumonia (probable VAP).  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, lung protective strategy, PEEP.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Pneumonia likely impeding progress for SBT and
   extubation.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PANCREATITIS -- acute, related to EtOH and/or lipidemia.  Continue
   current level of management (fluid mangement, pain management).
   Monitor amylase, lipase.  Surgery now off case.  ABD CT without
   evidence for bleeding.  Consider Meropenem empirically esp if evidence
   for necrotizing pancreatitis.
   FEVER
 attributed in part to acute pancreatitis.  Monitor closely,
   remains off antimicrobials.  Low threshold for iniating antimicrobials.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body Na depleted, clinically.  Plan check serum
   osmolality, urine osmolality.  Monitor serial Na.
   ACIDOSIS -- HCO3  improved, with repletion.
   ANEMIA
 intially progressive, despite net negative fliud balance. No
   evidence for intraabdominal bleed.  Transfuse to maintain Hct >21.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- Resolved.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Last consumption 5 days ago, need to monitor
   for evidence of withdrawal (DTs).
   LFT abnormality
 attributed to EtOH.  Monitor.
   LDH ELEVATION -- attributed in part to lung injury. Monitor.
   FLUIDS --  Marked volume resusitation.  Tolerated net diuresis (lasix)
   to treat pulmonary edema.  Monitor I/O, BP, urine output.  Need to
   balance desire to keep hypovolemic (ARDS) and sufficient intravascular
   hydration (acute pancreatitis and third spacing).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.
   ANXIETY -- continue iv benzodiazepine.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presented with acute pancreatitis and respiratory failure, specifically ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient continues to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement but now has signs of pneumonia, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated with a lung protective strategy, including PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). Antibiotics have been continued to treat the pneumonia.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, but close monitoring of blood pressure is recommended to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient has acute pancreatitis related to alcohol use and/or lipidemia. Fluid management and pain control are ongoing, and amylase and lipase levels should be monitored. Considering the possibility of necrotizing pancreatitis, meropenem has been considered empirically.

The patient's fever is attributed in part to acute pancreatitis. Closely monitoring for any signs of infection and maintaining a low threshold for initiating antimicrobials is advised. The patient has hypokalemia, and serum osmolality, urine osmolality, and serial sodium levels should be checked. Acidosis has improved, and the patient's anemia has worsened despite a negative fluid balance. Transfusion to maintain hematocrit (Hct) above 21% is recommended. Lactic acidosis has resolved, and chronic ethanol"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yof EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder presents now with
   acute pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS. Continues to demonstrate
   evidence for clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Attributed predominatly to ARDS in context of
   acute pancreatitis.  Radiographic and clinical improvement last week,
   but now with evidence for pneumonia (probable VAP).  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, lung protective strategy, PEEP.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Pneumonia likely impeding progress for SBT and
   extubation.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PANCREATITIS -- acute, related to EtOH and/or lipidemia.  Continue
   current level of management (fluid mangement, pain management).
   Monitor amylase, lipase.  Surgery now off case.  ABD CT without
   evidence for bleeding.  Consider Meropenem empirically esp if evidence
   for necrotizing pancreatitis.
   FEVER
 attributed in part to acute pancreatitis.  Monitor closely,
   remains off antimicrobials.  Low threshold for iniating antimicrobials.
   HYPONATREMIA -- Improved.  Monitor serial Na.
   ANEMIA
 intially progressive, despite net negative fliud balance. No
   evidence for intraabdominal bleed.  Transfuse to maintain Hct >21.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Last consumption 5 days ago, need to monitor
   for evidence of withdrawal (DTs).
   LFT abnormality
 attributed to EtOH.  Monitor.
   LDH ELEVATION -- attributed in part to lung injury. Monitor.
   FLUIDS --  Marked volume resusitation.  Tolerated net diuresis (lasix)
   to treat pulmonary edema.  Monitor I/O, BP, urine output.  Need to
   balance desire to keep hypovolemic (ARDS) and sufficient intravascular
   hydration (acute pancreatitis and third spacing).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.
   ANXIETY -- continue iv benzodiazepine.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presents with acute pancreatitis and respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. There is evidence of clinical improvement, but now there are signs of pneumonia, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's blood pressure is stable, and his pancreatitis is being managed with fluid management and pain control. His sodium levels have improved, but he is still anemic. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, likely due to alcohol abuse. His lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are elevated, indicating possible lung injury. The patient is tolerating tube feeding and is receiving nutritional support. He is also receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, which can lead to hypoxemia and the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for pneumonia, which may impede progress towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and extubation.

2. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension has resolved, close monitoring of blood pressure and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is necessary to prevent further episodes.

3. Pancreatitis: The"

1. Severe pancreatitis: The patient's APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk of around 3%. Causes of pancreatitis are alcohol abuse, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides. Lipase levels have rapidly downtrended, though this does not correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to 25. Her respiratory failure could be a complication of severe pancreatitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and respiratory failure. He has been on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain relievers. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues such as urinary tract infection, acute respiratory failure, constipation, acute pancreatitis, alcohol withdrawal, and potential complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers. The patient's vital signs indicate fever, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure. His laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and glycemic control is being maintained. The patient has multiple lines including a PICC line and an arterial line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and other risk factors can lead to the formation of blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially travel to the lungs causing a pulmonary embolism.
3. Stress ulcers: Prolonged ICU stay and critical illness can predispose the patient to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the"

   triglycerides.  Lipase rapidly downtrended, though this does not
   correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to 25.  Her
   respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3rd spacing with
   edema vs ARDS).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient initially had hypoxia/ARDS/Multifocal pneumonia, which was initially attributed to pulmonary edema. However, a CT angiography (CTA) negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), an electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac enzyme (CE) negative for myocardial infarction (MI), and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) negative for congestive heart failure (CHF) confirmed the diagnosis of ARDS. The cause of her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, and her platelet count (Plt) is low. She has a high triglyceride level and an elevated amylase level, indicating possible pancreatitis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia/ARDS/Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has shown massive improvement in her ARDS. The cause of her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection. She is weaned from the ARDSNET protocol and is being managed with pressure support ventilation. The plan is to change the ventilator settings, decrease sedation, and aim for extubation tomorrow.
2. Severe pancreatitis: The patient's APACHE II score suggests a lower"

   # hypoxia/ARDS/Multifocal pneumonia
 Initially attributed to pulmonary
   edema.  CTA negative for PE, EKG and CE negative for MI, TTE negative
   for CHF, serial CXR in the setting of diuresis confirms ARDS. Initial
   Pa02/FiO2 was 116.  The cause of her ARDS is either pancreatitis or
   infection. Massive improvement by [**5-26**].  Subsequently developed fever
   worrisome for PNA. IBW = 53.6 kg.

   # Severe pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality
   rate.  APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Lipase rapidly downtrended, though this does not
   correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to 25.  Her
   respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3rd spacing with
   edema vs ARDS).

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. She was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient developed ARDS initially attributed to pulmonary edema, but subsequent investigations ruled out pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and diuresis confirmed ARDS. The cause of her ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection.

The patient's condition has shown some improvement over time, with a decrease in PaO2/FiO2 ratio from 116 to 403. However, she still requires mechanical ventilation and sedation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 12.6 to 15.1 thousand/mm3, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated liver enzymes such as ALT and AST. The blood cultures grew E. coli, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is being treated empirically with ciprofloxacin.

The patient also has severe malnutrition, characterized by low albumin levels and deficiencies in calcium and phosphorus. She requires aggressive electrolyte repletion, thiamine, folate supplementation, and enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube.

Additionally, the patient has anemia, likely due to chronic alcohol abuse and mixed iron/folate deficiency. Her hemoglobin concentration has been dropping, and she requires close monitoring and"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yof EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder presents now with
   acute pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS. Continues to demonstrate
   evidence for clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Attributed predominatly to ARDS in context of
   acute pancreatitis.  Radiographic and clinical improvement last week,
   but now with evidence for pneumonia (probable VAP).  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, lung protective strategy, PEEP.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Pneumonia responding. Continue to progress to SBT and
   extubation.
   PANCREATITIS -- acute, related to EtOH and/or lipidemia.  Continue
   current level of management (fluid mangement, pain management).
   Monitor amylase, lipase.  Surgery now off case.  Iniital ABD CT without
   evidence for bleeding.  Consider Meropenem empirically esp if evidence
   for necrotizing pancreatitis.
   FEVER

   remains off antimicrobials.  Low threshold for iniating
   antimicrobials.  Low threshold for repeat Abd CT.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body depleted.  Possible SIADH. Possible
   drug-effect. Check serum and urine osmolality, electrolytes.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- may in part reflect pancreatic inflammation.  Monitor
   glucose, maintain <150

   LFT abnormality
 attributed to EtOH.  Monitor.
   LDH ELEVATION -- attributed in part to lung injury. Monitor.
   FLUIDS --  Marked volume resusitation.  Tolerated net diuresis (lasix)
   to treat pulmonary edema.  Monitor I/O, BP, urine output.  Need to

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder who presented with acute pancreatitis and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has shown clinical improvement but now demonstrates evidence of pneumonia (probable ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP). His pancreatitis is being managed with fluid management and pain management, and there is a consideration for surgery if necrotizing pancreatitis is present. The patient's fever is being monitored closely, and there is a low threshold for initiating antimicrobials. The patient also has hypotension, hyperglycemia, anemia, chronic EtOH abuse, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's clinical improvement has been compromised by the development of pneumonia, which is common in patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated for an extended period. VAP can lead to worsening respiratory function and potentially sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's marked volume resuscitation and net negative fluid balance may put him at risk for AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential to prevent this complication.
3. Pancreatitis complications: The patient's acute pancreatitis could lead to local and systemic complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or infected pancreatic necrosis requiring surgical intervention.

- The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder.
- He presented with acute pancreatitis and developed respiratory failure attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has shown improvement in recent days, but now demonstrates evidence of pneumonia, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Mechanical ventilation and antibiotics are being continued, and the patient is progressing towards a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation.
- The patient has acute pancreatitis related to ethanol abuse and/or lipidemia, and current management includes fluid management and pain management.
- His fever is attributed in part to acute pancreatitis, and he remains off antimicrobials for now.
- The patient has hypotonic hyponatremia, possibly due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) or drug effect.
- Hyperglycemia may be related to pancreatic inflammation, and the patient's glucose levels are being monitored.
- The patient is anemic, but there is no evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding. He will be transfused to maintain a hematocrit level above 21%.
- The patient has a history of chronic ethanol abuse and may need monitoring for evidence of withdrawal.
- Liver function tests are abnormal due to ethanol abuse and will be monitored.
- Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are attributed in part to"

   appear similar in size and appearance compared to the prior study. No
   vascular complications are seen. No evidence of pancreatic necrosis.
   2. Improvement in the edema/ARDS and consolidative changes in both lung
   bases.
   3. Mild narrowing of the origin of the celiac trunk, likely due to
   compression by the median arcuate ligament.
   4. Multiple uterine fibroids.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 YO F with EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder present with
   findings c/w pancreatitis and hypotension.
   .
   # hypoxia/ARDS/Multifocal pneumonia
 Initially attributed to pulmonary
   edema.  CTA negative for PE, EKG and CE negative for MI, TTE negative
   for CHF, serial CXR in the setting of diuresis confirms ARDS. Initial
   Pa02/FiO2 was 116.  The cause of her ARDS is either pancreatitis or
   infection. Massive improvement by [**5-26**].  Subsequently developed fever
   worrisome for PNA. IBW = 53.6 kg.
   - Vent Day 1 = [**5-24**], weaned from ARDSNET protocol, attempt at weaning
   as ARDS and Multifocal pna are improving
   - on cipro (day 1 = [**5-28**]), vanco d/c

   - sputum cx pos for oropharyngeal flora and H.Flu (f/u from [**5-26**] and
   [**5-28**])
   - follow compliance, Pa/FiO2
   - change vent to pressure support, wean down sedation, aim for
   extubation tomorrow.
   .
   # Severe pancreatitis: [**Last Name (un) 1840**] score of 3 @ 48 hours = 16% mortality
   rate.  APACHE II score suggests lower mortality risk ~ 3%.  Causes are
   alcohol, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated
   triglycerides.  Lipase rapidly downtrended, though this does not
   correlate with severity. Her HCT has fallen from 38 to 25.  Her
   respiratory failure (below), could be a complication (3rd spacing with
   edema vs ARDS).
   - enteral feeding with NJ tube

   # anemia: likely chronic and acute. Chronic: likely alcoholic
   myelosuppression with mixed iron/foltate deficiency (RDW > 20). Acute
   hydration and dilution with blood loss. Hct drop overnight on [**5-25**] is
   unclear as there was no evidence of blood loss or  hemolysis.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder who presented with findings consistent with acute pancreatitis and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, erythema surrounding arterial line insertion site, transaminitis, urinary tract infection, severe malnutrition, anemia, alcohol abuse, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Complications related to severe pancreatitis:
- Pancreatic necrosis: This occurs when the pancreatic tissue dies due to inadequate blood supply.
- Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): Severe pancreatitis can lead to a systemic inflammatory response, which can cause organ dysfunction.
- Pancreatic pseudocyst: A fluid collection that forms outside the pancreas as a result of inflammation.
- Pancreatic abscess: An infected fluid collection that forms outside the pancreas.

2. Complications related to respiratory failure:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): This is a type of lung infection that occurs in patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation.
- Barotrauma: Injury to the lung tissue caused by high airway pressures during mechanical ventilation.
- Volutrauma: Injury to the lung tissue caused by high volumes delivered during mechanical ventilation.
- Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Damage to the lung tissue"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient initially presented with hypoxia/ARDS/Multifocal pneumonia, which was initially attributed to pulmonary edema. However, a CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism, an EKG and cardiac echo were negative for myocardial infarction, and serial chest X-rays confirmed ARDS. The cause of ARDS is either pancreatitis or infection.

2. Severe pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with severe pancreatitis, as indicated by a Ranson score of 3 at 48 hours, which carries a 16% mortality rate. The APACHE II score suggests a lower mortality risk of around 3%. The causes of pancreatitis are alcohol abuse, gallstones (unlikely given negative radiography), and elevated triglycerides. Lipase levels have rapidly decreased, but this does not correlate with severity. The patient's HCT has fallen from 38 to 25, and her respiratory failure could be a complication (3rd spacing with edema vs. ARDS).

3. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient has a documented UTI caused by pan-sensitive E. coli. She is currently on ciprofloxacin.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated transaminase levels, initially suspected to be alcohol-induced. However, it could"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yof EtOH abuse, hypertension, seizure disorder presents now with
   acute pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS. Continues to demonstrate
   evidence for clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Attributed predominatly to ARDS in context of
   acute pancreatitis.  Radiographic and clinical improvement last week,
   but now with evidence for pneumonia (probable VAP).  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, lung protective strategy, PEEP.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Pneumonia responding. Continue to progress to SBT and
   extubation.
   PANCREATITIS -- acute, related to EtOH and/or lipidemia.  Continue
   current level of management (fluid mangement, pain management).
   Monitor amylase, lipase.  Surgery now off case.  Iniital ABD CT without
   evidence for bleeding.  Consider Meropenem empirically esp if evidence
   for necrotizing pancreatitis.
   FEVER
 attributed in part to acute pancreatitis.  Monitor closely,
   remains off antimicrobials.  Low threshold for iniating
   antimicrobials.  Low threshold for repeat Abd CT.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body depleted.  Possible SIADH. Possible
   drug-effect. Check serum and urine osmolality, electrolytes.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- may in part reflect pancreatic inflammation.  Monitor
   glucose, maintain <150
   ANEMIA
 intially progressive, despite net negative fliud balance. No
   evidence for intraabdominal bleed.  Transfuse to maintain Hct >21.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Last consumption 5 days PTA, need to monitor
   for evidence of withdrawal (DTs) -- now less likely for DTs.
   RASH -- possible drug-related, but suspect contact, perhaps related to
   bedding.  Change sheets to bleach-free.
   LFT abnormality
 attributed to EtOH.  Monitor.
   LDH ELEVATION -- attributed in part to lung injury. Slowly resolving.
   Monitor.
   FLUIDS --  Marked volume resusitation.  Tolerated net diuresis (lasix)
   to treat pulmonary edema.  Monitor I/O, BP, urine output.  Need to
   balance desire to keep hypovolemic (ARDS) and sufficient intravascular
   hydration (acute pancreatitis and third spacing).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF, but need to unclog or repeat
   feeding tube placement.  [**Month (only) 11**] require TPN.
   ANXIETY -- continue iv benzodiazepine.  Hope to continue to taper.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He presented with acute pancreatitis and respiratory failure due to ARDS. The patient has shown clinical improvement but now has evidence of pneumonia, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He continues to be mechanically ventilated using a lung-protective strategy with PEEP. Antimicrobials have been continued, and the pneumonia is responding. The plan is to progress to spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and eventual extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS and now complicated by VAP. Close monitoring and appropriate management, including continued mechanical ventilation and antimicrobials, are necessary.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis related to ethanol abuse and/or lipidemia. Current management includes fluid management and pain management. Monitoring of amylase and lipase levels is important, and consideration of meropenem empirically may be necessary if evidence for necrotizing pancreatitis is present.
3. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be attributed in part to acute pancreatitis. Monitoring is essential, and a low threshold for initiating antimicrobials should be maintained, especially if there are signs of infection. Repeat abdominal CT may be considered if necessary.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which could be due"
