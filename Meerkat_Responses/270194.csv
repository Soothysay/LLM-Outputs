   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M hx CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, a. fib not on Coumadin, and recent
   hospitalization for SIRS now with pneumonia on CXR and hypotension.
   .
   # Right pleural effusion. Cannot rule out right lower quadrant
   pneumonia, likely nosocomial (MRSA/pseudomonal). Likely etiology for
   patient's shortness of breath, productive cough. Also consider CHF,
   aspiration;
   - Continue vancomycin, zosyn
   - Monitor fever curve
   - Check BNP
   - Obtain repeat CXR AM
   - Follow up final CXR read
   - Likely [**Female First Name (un) **] in am.
   .
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia/hypothermia: Patient hypotensive,
   tachycardic, hypothermic, concerning for signs of active infection.
   Currently calling this SIRS and possible seppsis.  Source likely to be
   pulmonary as above, although cannot exclude GI, GU (UA negative in ED),
   skin (patient's rash unlikely cellulitis), c diff (current WBC may
   reflect leukocytosis).  Other potential etiologies would be
   endocrinopathy (Adrenal insuficiency, Thyroid disorder), or possible
   central etiology such as lesion to hypothalamus.  Infection is
   currently the leading differential and needs to be treated broadly.
   - Obtain daily blood cultures
   - Follow up blood cultures
   - Monitor fever curve
   - Bedside ultrasound for ascites; paracentesis if positive to r/o SBP
   - Put in arterial line
   - Follow up final CT abdomen read
   - Broad spectum ABX
   - Early goal directed Tx: CVP 8-12, MAP > 65, ScvO2 > 70.
   - Warm with warming machine.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient with a history of A-Fib.  Does not seem to be on
   anything for rate control at baseline.  Currently  tachycardic is
   likely [**12-29**] SIRS/Sepsis physiology and compensatory increase in cardiac
   output.  Other potential causes are from the pressors and simply A-Fib
   with RVR.  Currently tachy 110-130.  Potentially could slow down to
   attempt to improve BP, however seems a little counterintuitive given
   already low BP and likely hypotension is not only from tachycardia.
   .
   # Chest pain/recent NSTEMI. Chest pain has resolved. Unclear whether
   related with underlying pneumonia. Troponin downtrending from prior;
   will trend to assess elevation.
   - Obtain second set cardiac enzymes
   - Obtain repeat CXR AM
   - Repeat ECG in am
   .
   # Rash. Appears to be chronic dermatitis; does not appear cellulitic.
   - Follow demarcated areas of erythema to assess worsening
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # End stage liver disease. Labeled crytogenic but patient with previous
   heavy alcohol use.
   - Continue lactulose prn
   .
   # CKD: Patient with baseline Cr noted to be 2.7.  Currently is lower.
   [**Month (only) 11**] reflect decrease muscle mass.  Alternatively may just be
   optimized.
   -Fluids per SIRS/sepsis protocol.
   -trend Cr.
   .
   # Pancytopenia. Currently resolved.  Thrombocytopenia likely [**12-29**] liver
   disease;
   - Check fibrinogen, FDP, LDH to r/o underlying coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology at this time.  Patient is at baseline.  Will
   rule out DIC and keep hct > 25 (or >30 if ScvO2 is < 70).
   75 yr old male with MMP, recently admitted with hypotension and
   hypothermia. Dx paracentesis and LP both nondiagnostic, pancytopenic,
   tx with Vanc/Zosyn x 6 d, stress dose steroids, pressors. Sent to floor
   and developed a cough and rash. Eventually discharged to rehab.
   Yesterday had right upper c/p. Saw Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**], had CXR and reportedly
   looked stable. During visit, BP [**9-/2150**], HR 88, T 95.1. This AM noted to
   be hypothermic and hypotensive. Sent to [**Hospital3 **] Hosp (BP 70/50)
   then transferred to [**Hospital1 1**].
   In ED T 96, HR 90, BP 124/70, RR 19, sat 100% on NRB, 97% on 2L.
   Mentating at all times. In the ED, BP dropped to 80. He received 2 L NS
   and levophed started in ED. At this time, has gotten total of 4 L IVF
   and remains hypotensive SBP ~85, MAP 60.

   previous CT chest, and today's CT abd/pelvis reviewed.
   IMPRESSION
   Complicated case. Currently with hypotension and hypothermia,
   intermittent right sided c/p.
   1. Hypotension / probable septic shock - infection likely given
   hypothermia, leftward shift. High likelihood of SBP +/- pna
   Might be aspirating. Would consider adrenal insufficiency especially as
   was on SD steroids last admission.
   - Check CVP and keep [**7-8**], c/w hydration, keep MAP>60
   - Add dexamethasone, [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   - Consider adding vasopressin, diagnostic para tonight, a-line
   2. Anemia - expect Hct to drop further with fluids and blood loss
   around CVL
   Cross match, keep Hct 25
   3.  Pleural effusion - likely tracking ascites, would consider tapping
   to r/o empyema
   4. Afib - tachycardic now, will watch for now, consider CCB or beta
   blocker for rate control once BP increases. Hypotension not clearly
   related to tachycardia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic conditions including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, and others. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, hypothermia, and a productive cough. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors. His condition has been complicated by pancytopenia, which is likely related to liver disease. He also has a rash, which appears to be a chronic dermatitis rather than cellulitis. The patient's anemia is of unclear etiology and may be due to DIC or other causes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Probable Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and hypothermia suggest a possible septic shock. There is a high likelihood of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or pneumonia as the source of infection. Aspiration pneumonia should also be considered. Treatment should focus on aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and stress dose steroids.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen with continued fluid administration and blood loss around the central venous catheter. Blood transfusion may be necessary to maintain a hematocrit level above 25.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a right-sided pleural effusion, which is likely tracking ascites. Tapping the effusion may be necessary to rule out empyema"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation (AFib) not on Coumadin, and a recent hospitalization for sepsis-induced respiratory insufficiency (SIRS) now presenting with pneumonia on chest X-ray and hypotension. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Hypotension/Tachycardia/Hypothermia: The patient is hypotensive, tachycardic, and hypothermic, which are concerning for signs of active infection. The source of infection is likely to be pulmonary, but other potential sources such as gastrointestinal (SBP), urinary tract, skin, or Clostridioides difficile infection should also be considered. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn, and further consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended to determine appropriate antibiotic choices.

2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient's peritoneal fluid results are suggestive of SBP, although it is questionable whether he would present with this condition in the manner described. The patient should continue on vancomycin and Zosyn, and follow-up cultures should be obtained.

3. Right Pleural Effusion: The patient may have a right pleural effusion"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M hx CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, a. fib not on Coumadin, and recent
   hospitalization for SIRS now with pneumonia on CXR and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension/tachycardia/hypothermia: Patient hypotensive,
   tachycardic, hypothermic, concerning for signs of active infection.
   Currently calling this SIRS and possible seppsis.  Source likely to be
   pulmonary, although cannot exclude GI (SBP possible given peritoneal
   fluid results), GU (UA negative in ED), skin (patient's rash unlikely
   cellulitis), c diff.  Other potential etiologies would be
   endocrinopathy (adrenal insuficiency, thyroid disorder), or possible
   central etiology such as lesion to hypothalamus.  Infection is
   currently the leading differential and needs to be treated broadly.
   - Continue vancomycin, zosyn
   - Consult infectious disease regarding other antibiotic choices to use
   - If clinically does not improve, consider consulting IP regarding
   tapping right pleural effusion
   - Continue to obtain daily blood cultures
   - Follow up cultures
   - Monitor fever curve
   - Attempt to place arterial line
   - Follow up final CT abdomen read
   - Early goal directed treatment: CVP 8-12, MAP > 65, ScvO2 > 70.
   - Continue bear hugger.
   .
   # SBP. Likely given peritoneal fluid results. Questionable whether
   would present in the manner that it has in this patient; likely to be
   another source of infection.
   - Continue vancomycin, zosyn
   - Consult infectious disease regarding other antibiotic choices to use
   - Follow up cultures
   .
   # Right pleural effusion. Cannot rule out right lower quadrant
   pneumonia, likely nosocomial (MRSA/pseudomonal). Likely etiology for
   patient's shortness of breath, productive cough. Also consider CHF,
   aspiration;
   - Obtain repeat CXR AM
   - Follow up final CXR read
   - If clinically does not improve, consider consulting IP regarding
   tapping right pleural effusion
   - Start nebulizer treatment
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient with a history of A-Fib.  Does not seem to be on
   anything for rate control at baseline.  Currently tachycardia is likely
   [**12-29**] SIRS/Sepsis physiology and compensatory increase in cardiac
   output.  Other potential causes are from the pressors and simply A-Fib
   with RVR.  Currently tachy to 120s.  Potentially could slow down to
   attempt to improve BP, however seems a little counterintuitive given
   already low BP and likely hypotension is not only from tachycardia.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Chest pain/recent NSTEMI. Chest pain has resolved. Unclear whether
   related with underlying pneumonia. Troponin downtrending from prior;
   will trend to assess elevation.
   - Obtain second set cardiac enzymes
   - Obtain repeat CXR AM
   - Repeat ECG in am
   .
   # Rash. Appears to be chronic dermatitis and improved in appearnace;
   does not appear cellulitic.
   - Follow demarcated areas of erythema to assess worsening
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # End stage liver disease. Labeled crytogenic but patient with previous
   heavy alcohol use.
   - Continue lactulose prn
   .
   # CKD: Patient with baseline Cr noted to be 2.7.  Currently is lower.
   [**Month (only) 11**] reflect decrease muscle mass.  Alternatively may just be
   optimized.
   - Continue fluids per SIRS/sepsis protocol.
   - Trend Cr.

   # Pancytopenia. Currently resolved.  Thrombocytopenia likely [**12-29**] liver
   disease;
   - Check fibrinogen, FDP, LDH to r/o underlying coagulopathy

   hospitalization for SIRS now with pneumonia on CXR and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension/tachycardia/hypothermia: Most likely related to sepsis
   secondary to pulmonary infection. However source is not absolutely
   clear. Pt improving on vancomycin, zosyn, however still requiring
   pressor support. Other considerations include hypothyroidism and
   Adrenal Insufficiency.
   - Continue vancomycin, Change to Cefepime zosyn
   - If clinically does not improve, consider consulting IP regarding
   tapping right pleural effusion
   - Continue to obtain daily blood cultures
   - Follow up cultures
   - Monitor fever curve
   - Follow up final CT abdomen read
   - Early goal directed treatment: CVP 8-12, MAP > 65, ScvO2 > 70.
   - Continue bear hugger prn
   - Wean levophed given diminished lower extremity pulses.
   .
   # Cool Lower Extremities: Dopplerable pulses bilaterally
   -          Wean levophed as tolerated
   -          Monitor pulses Q1hour
   -          Vascular if unable to Doppler pulses
   .
   # SBP. Likely given peritoneal fluid results. Questionable whether
   would present in the manner that it has in this patient; likely to be
   another source of infection.
   - Albumin today per SBP protocol.
   - Cefepime will cover.
   - Follow up cultures
   .
   # Right pleural effusion. Cannot rule out right lower quadrant
   pneumonia, likely nosocomial (MRSA/pseudomonal). Likely etiology for
   patient's shortness of breath, productive cough. Also consider CHF,
   hydrothorax secondary to ascites/liver disease.
   - Obtain repeat CXR AM
   - Follow up final CXR read
   - If clinically does not improve, consider consulting IP regarding
   tapping right pleural effusion
   - Start nebulizer treatment
   .
   # Tachycardia: This AM rate controlled in 70s. Will wean pressors as
   tolerated.
   -          Continue to monitor
   -          FU EKG
   .
   # Chest pain/recent NSTEMI. Chest pain has resolved. Enzymes flat. NO
   EKG Changes.
   - Obtain repeat CXR AM
   - Repeat ECG in am

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, and recent hospitalization for sepsis now with pneumonia on chest X-ray and hypotension. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for sepsis secondary to pulmonary infection. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 128/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an inflammatory response. Blood cultures have been obtained and are pending. The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.2 mg/dL, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Other lab results include anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral anterior lung fields with rhonchi, elevated jugular venous distention (JVD), and cool extremities with diminished pulses bilaterally. These findings suggest possible pulmonary infection and systemic involvement.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation, and recent hospitalization for sepsis now presenting with pneumonia on chest X-ray and hypotension. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and hypothermia suggest the possibility of sepsis secondary to a pulmonary infection. The source of infection is not clear, but the patient is showing improvement on vancomycin and Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam). Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.

2. Hypothyroidism: The patient has an elevated TSH level of 6.1, indicating possible hypothyroidism. The patient was restarted on Synthroid at a dose of 25 mcg.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: This possibility should be considered due to the patient's presentation with hypotension, which may be related to sepsis or primary adrenal insufficiency.

4. Right pleural effusion: The patient has a right-sided pleural effusion, which may be due to pneumonia, likely nosocomial (MRSA/pseudomonal). It is also important to consider other causes such as congestive heart failure ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He is currently in the ICU for sepsis secondary to pneumonia and has developed hypotension, tachycardia, and hypothermia. The patient has also been diagnosed with cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. He presents with pancytopenia, anemia, and cool lower extremities. The patient's condition is complicated by a large right pleural effusion, which could be due to hepatic hydrothorax or nosocomial pneumonia. He requires multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure and has a central venous pressure (CVP) that is intermittently low. The patient's lactate level is elevated, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. He has been started on vancomycin and cefepime while awaiting cultures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Tachycardia/Hypothermia: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and hypothermia are likely related to sepsis secondary to pulmonary infection. However, the source of infection is not absolutely clear. The patient is improving on vancomycin and zosyn, but still requires pressor support. Other considerations include hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and cefepime. He remains hypotensive and tachycardic, requiring vasopressor support. The patient also has a right pleural effusion, which may be related to his underlying liver disease. Other medical issues include possible end-stage liver disease, pancytopenia, and anemia of unclear etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels suggest ongoing sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but the right pleural effusion and possible pneumonia are potential sources. Continued antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and cefepime is appropriate, and further investigation into the source of infection should be pursued.

2. Right Pleural Effusion: The patient's pleural effusion may be due to his underlying liver disease (hepatic hydrothorax) or a nosocomial infection (MRSA/pseudomonal). This could be contributing to his shortness of breath and productive cough. Monitoring the effusion"

   Chief Complaint: Fever, Hypotension
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] and flagyl per morning roudns
   - Repeated albumin 1g/kg (gave a total of 87.5g) for treatment of SBP
   - Started rifaximin 200mg tid for continued mild asterixis on exam
   while on lactulose
   - Hct stable at 23
   - Started midodrine without much improvement to BPs
   - Faxed request for medical records from [**Hospital3 91**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10366**]);
   specifically requested EGD, colonoscopy
   - Echo showed suboptimal image quality. Moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with low
   normal systolic function. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
   with preserved global and regional systolic function. Trivial
   pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
   of [**2189-11-25**], the right ventricular cavity is now slightly dilated with
   low normal systolic function and the estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is higher. This constellation of findings is

   # Hypotension/tachycardia/hypothermia: Most likely related to sepsis
   secondary to pulmonary infection. However source is not absolutely
   clear. Patient improving on vancomycin, zosyn, flagyl. Currently on
   Midodrine and Dex. Also may be related to adrenal Insufficiency with
   somewhat abnormal [**Last Name (un) **] stim.   ECHO with new right sided dilation,
   LENIs negative.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefipime, Flagyl
   - Decrease Midodrine
   - If clinically does not improve, consider consulting IP regarding
   tapping right pleural effusion
   - Continue to obtain daily blood cultures
   - Follow up cultures
   - Monitor fever curve
   - Early goal directed treatment: CVP 8-12, MAP > 65, ScvO2 > 70.
   - Continue bear hugger prn
   - Defer on endocrinology consult at this time
   .
   # SBP. Likely given peritoneal fluid results. Questionable whether
   would present in the manner that it has in this patient; likely to be
   another source of infection.
   - Re-tap today for reevaluation of SBP
   - Continue cefepime
   - Follow up cultures
   .
   # Right pleural effusion. Cannot rule out right lower quadrant
   pneumonia, likely nosocomial (MRSA/pseudomonal). Likely etiology for
   patient's shortness of breath, productive cough. Also consider CHF,
   hydrothorax secondary to ascites/liver disease.
   - Obtain repeat CXR AM
   - Follow up final CXR read
   - If clinically does not improve, consider consulting IP regarding
   tapping right pleural effusion
   - Start nebulizer treatment
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology at this time.  Question [**12-29**] procedures. Will
   rule out DIC and keep hct > 25 (or >30 if ScvO2 is < 70).
   - Obtain q12 Hct
   - Start IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to guaiac stool
   .
   # Chest pain/recent NSTEMI. Chest pain has resolved. Enzymes flat. No
   EKG Changes.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # End stage liver disease. Labeled crytogenic but patient with previous
   heavy alcohol use.
   - Continue lactulose prn
   - Follow up GI recs
   .
   # CKD: Patient with baseline Cr noted to be 2.7.  Currently is lower.
   [**Month (only) 11**] reflect decrease muscle mass. Trending up currently.
   - Continue fluids per SIRS/sepsis protocol.
   - Trend Cr
   - Regular diet.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M hx CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, a. fib not on Coumadin, and recent
   hospitalization for SIRS now with pneumonia on CXR and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension/tachycardia/hypothermia: Most likely related to sepsis
   secondary to pulmonary infection. However source is not absolutely
   clear. Patient improving on vancomycin, zosyn, however still requiring
   pressor support. Other considerations include hypothyroidism and
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - Continue vancomycin, change zosyn to cefepime as to change antibiotic
   regimen that patient was last on
   - Add flagyl for added coverage
   - If clinically does not improve, consider consulting IP regarding
   tapping right pleural effusion
   - Continue to obtain daily blood cultures
   - Follow up cultures
   - Monitor fever curve
   - Early goal directed treatment: CVP 8-12, MAP > 65, ScvO2 > 70.
   - Continue bear hugger prn
   - Defer on endocrinology consult at this time
   - Obtain echo to assess pericardial effusion
   .
   # Cool lower extremities: Pulses dopplerable bilaterally.
   - Levophed stopped
   - Monitor pulses q1-2hour
   - Vascular if unable to doppler pulses
   .
   # SBP. Likely given peritoneal fluid results. Questionable whether
   would present in the manner that it has in this patient; likely to be
   another source of infection.
   - Re-tap today for fungal culture
   - Continue cefepime
   - Follow up cultures
   .
   # Right pleural effusion. Cannot rule out right lower quadrant
   pneumonia, likely nosocomial (MRSA/pseudomonal). Likely etiology for
   patient's shortness of breath, productive cough. Also consider CHF,
   hydrothorax secondary to ascites/liver disease.
   - Obtain repeat CXR AM
   - Follow up final CXR read
   - If clinically does not improve, consider consulting IP regarding
   tapping right pleural effusion
   - Start nebulizer treatment
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology at this time.  Question [**12-29**] procedures. Will
   rule out DIC and keep hct > 25 (or >30 if ScvO2 is < 70).
   - Obtain q8 Hct
   - Start IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to guaiac stool
   .
   # Chest pain/recent NSTEMI. Chest pain has resolved. Enzymes flat. No
   EKG Changes.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # End stage liver disease. Labeled crytogenic but patient with previous
   heavy alcohol use.
   - Continue lactulose prn
   - Follow up GI recs
   .
   # CKD: Patient with baseline Cr noted to be 2.7.  Currently is lower.
   [**Month (only) 11**] reflect decrease muscle mass.  Alternatively may just be
   optimized.
   - Continue fluids per SIRS/sepsis protocol.
   - Trend Cr
   - Regular diet.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, and previous hospitalization for suspected sepsis now presenting with pneumonia on chest X-ray and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, hypothermia, tachycardia, elevated central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild right ventricular cavity dilation with low normal systolic function, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function, and trivial pericardial effusion.

The patient is experiencing decreased urine output and has been found to have a large number of clots in the urinary catheter, which have been flushed out. The patient also has mild asterixis on exam while on lactulose, suggesting hepatic encephalopathy.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.5 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, elevated lactate level, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Imaging studies, such as the chest X-ray, are pending.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

","The patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and hypotension. The diagnostic paracentesis showed 4 WBCs (2 bands) and the patient has been started on treatment for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which includes midodrine, octreotide, and albumin. However, the albumin is being held due to concerns about volume overload. Hepatology recommendations include increasing rifaximin to 400mg TID and increasing lactulose to 45 mg QID. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/61 to 109/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 27 mmHg. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 47 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, platelet count of 131 mg/dL, sodium level of 3.2 mg/dL, potassium level of 17 mEq/L, chloride level of 5.2 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 28.0%, BUN level of 74 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 130 mg/dL, and liver enzymes within normal range. 

The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and peritoneal fluid culture are all negative for growth. Imaging shows ascites but normal portal vein flow. 

The patient's medical allergies include levofloxacin, shellfish, latex, and a rash from Aranesp. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and other medications. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for bladder pain, for which they were given phenazopyridine and 0.5mg morphine. The patient also reported another melanotic stool, which was guaiac positive. 

The patient's weight is currently 215.3 kg, down from 88.6 kg on admission. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), volume overload, gastrointestinal bleeding (given the guaiac positive stools), infections (due to immunosuppression and indwelling lines), and potential cardiac issues due to atrial fibrillation."

   secondary to pulmonary infection. However source is not absolutely
   clear. Patient improving on vancomycin, zosyn, flagyl. Currently on
   Midodrine and Dex. Also may be related to adrenal Insufficiency with
   somewhat abnormal [**Last Name (un) **] stim.   ECHO with new right sided dilation,
   LENIs negative.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation, and recent hospitalization for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) now presenting with pneumonia on chest X-ray and hypotension. The patient is currently being treated for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin. He also has a right pleural effusion and ascites.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection, including fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count. This indicates a possible septic response due to the pulmonary infection.

2. Liver disease: The patient has end-stage liver disease, likely caused by heavy alcohol use. This puts him at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.

3. Renal failure: The patient has impaired kidney function, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. This could be due to acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to sepsis or chronic kidney disease (CKD).

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to liver disease or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, and recent hospitalization for sepsis now with pneumonia on chest X-ray and hypotension. The patient is in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with worsening renal failure, encephalopathy, without a clear source of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of end-stage liver disease and is showing signs of altered mental status. This could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease.
2. Infection: The patient has pneumonia on chest X-ray and is hypotensive, suggesting a possible infection. Further investigation and treatment are needed to identify and manage the source of infection.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and hypothermia may be related to adrenal insufficiency. This condition can occur in critically ill patients and can worsen the patient's condition if not recognized and treated promptly.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 3.2, indicating worsening renal function. This could be due to relative hypotension or another underlying cause.

   secondary to pulmonary infection. However source is not absolutely
   clear. Patient without meaningful improvement with vancomycin, zosyn,
   flagyl. Currently on Midodrine and Dex. Also may be related to adrenal
   Insufficiency with somewhat abnormal [**Last Name (un) **] stim.   ECHO with new right

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and previous hospitalization for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) now presenting with pneumonia on chest X-ray and hypotension. The patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with worsening renal failure, encephalopathy, and no clear source of infection.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is encephalopathic, with multifactorial causes including hepatic encephalopathy, ICU delirium, and potential infection.

2. Hypotension/tachycardia/hypothermia: The patient is hypotensive, tachycardic, and hypothermic, which may be related to sepsis secondary to a pulmonary infection. However, the source of infection is not absolutely clear. The patient has not shown meaningful improvement with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl. There is also a concern for adrenal insufficiency with somewhat abnormal cortisol stimulation.

3. Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 3.2 without a clear etiology. The urine shows an increase in white/red blood cells, most likely related to relative hypotension. The patient has been started on hepatoren"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as possible nosocomial pneumonia, hydrothorax, ascites/liver disease, and sepsis secondary to pulmonary infection.

2. Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has acute kidney injury on top of chronic kidney disease, which is likely multifactorial including pre-renal hypovolemia, post-renal Foley catheter, and hepatorenal syndrome.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status, which can be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy as a result of end-stage liver disease.

4. Infection: The patient has not shown meaningful improvement with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl, indicating a potential source of infection that needs further investigation and treatment.

5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's symptoms may also be related to adrenal insufficiency, possibly indicated by abnormal aldosterone stimulation.

6. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing pancytopenia, with thrombocytopenia likely due to liver disease. This requires careful monitoring and management.

7. Chest Pain/Recent NSTEMI: Although the patient's chest pain has resolved, and enzymes are flat with no EKG changes, there is still a possibility of ongoing cardiac issues"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M hx CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, a. fib not on Coumadin, and recent
   hospitalization for SIRS now with pneumonia on CXR and hypotension. In
   the MICU patient with worsening renal failure, encephalopathy, without
   clear source of infection.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Multifactorial. Hepatic Encephalopathy. ICU
   Delirium. Infection.
   - Lactulose, may need NG tube however will discuss with family
   - Zyprexa prn agitation follow EKG for QT prolongation
   - Normalize sleep wake cycle.
   .
   # Hypotension/tachycardia/hypothermia: Most likely related to sepsis
   secondary to pulmonary infection. However source is not absolutely
   clear. Patient without meaningful improvement with vancomycin, zosyn,
   flagyl. Currently on Midodrine and Dex. Also may be related to adrenal
   Insufficiency with somewhat abnormal [**Last Name (un) **] stim.   ECHO with new right
   sided dilation, LENIs negative.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefipime, Flagyl
   - Vancomycin level today, dose by level
   - Continue Midodrine 5mg Daily
   - Continue Dex
   - Blood Cultures if  spikes
   - Follow up cultures
   - Monitor fever curve
   - Early goal directed treatment: CVP 8-12, MAP > 65, ScvO2 > 70.
   - Continue bear hugger prn
   - Defer on endocrinology consult at this time
   - FU LH, FSH, Alpha Subunit
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Crt to 3.2 without clear etiology.
   Urine with increase in whites/red blood cells.  Most likely related to
   relative hypotension. Started HRS therapy yesterday without
   improvement. Na does not fit with HRS.
   - Continue fluids per SIRS/sepsis protocol.
   - Continue Midodrine/Octreotide
   - Trend Cr
   - Possible renal consult pending family meeting.
   .
   # SBP. Repeat diagnostic para with4 white blood cells.
   - Re-tap today for reevaluation of SBP
   - Continue cefepime
   - Follow up cultures
   .
   # Right pleural effusion. Cannot rule out right lower quadrant
   pneumonia, likely nosocomial (MRSA/pseudomonal). Likely etiology for
   patient's shortness of breath, productive cough. Also consider CHF,
   hydrothorax secondary to ascites/liver disease.
   - Obtain repeat CXR AM Daily
   - If clinically does not improve, consider consulting IP regarding
   tapping right pleural effusion
   - Start nebulizer treatment
   .
   # Anemia: Stable. However, guaiac positive dark stool yesterday.
   - Obtain q12 Hct
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to guaiac stool
   .
   # Chest pain/recent NSTEMI. Chest pain has resolved. Enzymes flat. No
   EKG Changes.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # End stage liver disease. Labeled crytogenic but patient with previous
   heavy alcohol use.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin prn
   - Follow up GI recs.
   # Pancytopenia. Thrombocytopenia likely [**12-29**] liver disease. Platelets
   stable. HIV negative. Should
   - Check fibrinogen, FDP, LDH to r/o underlying coagulopathy
   .
   # FEN: IVF bolus as per above, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no subcutaneous heparin at this time given
   concern for coagulopathy
   # Access: PIV, RIJ, DC a line today
   # Communication: Family
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient and patient's family), Given
   worsening clinical status family meeting today to discuss goals of
   care.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
   Situation d/w family and PCP ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 851**] [**Doctor Last Name 1362**]) during bedside family
   meeting. Mr. [**Known lastname 10055**] is developing worsening renal and respiratory
   failue as outlined above in the setting of recent MI, ESLD, and likely
   infection. Aggressive support at this time would include intubation,
   NGT placement, likely hemodialysis and given his comorbidities, it is
   unlikely that these interventions would result in his leaving the ICU.
   Given his current condition, the team and family elected to focus on
   ongoing care focused primarily on comfort, including morphine for
   respiratory distress. We will continue antibiotics, but will not
   escalate to care requiring invasive procedures. Patient is DNR/I. All
   questions answered.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation, and previous hospitalization for sepsis now presenting with pneumonia on chest X-ray and hypotension. The patient has worsening renal failure, encephalopathy, and no clear source of infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease. Lactulose has been ordered to manage this condition.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and hypothermia suggest sepsis secondary to pulmonary infection. The source of infection is not absolutely clear, but the patient is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl. Blood cultures if spikes and follow-up cultures have been ordered.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may also have adrenal insufficiency, as indicated by abnormal cortisol stimulation test. Midodrine and dex are being continued, and an ECHO with new right-sided dilation has been ordered.

4. Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 3.2 without a clear etiology. Urine analysis shows an increase in white and red blood cells"

   admitted with similar presentation as well as CP / SOB
   75 yo M hx CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, a. fib not on Coumadin, and recent
   hospitalization for SIRS/hypotension/hypothermia now admitted with
   similar presentation as well as chest pain and shortness of breath.
   Patient has developed worsening renal and respiratory failure and
   family discussions were held regarding the likely upcoming need for
   intubation, NGT placement, and possibly hemodialysis. Patient has
   decided to focus on comfort measures only, including morphine for
   respiratory distress.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient presented with similar symptoms of hypotension, hypothermia, and SIRS during a previous hospitalization. 

The patient has been admitted with chest pain and shortness of breath. He has developed worsening renal and respiratory failure, leading to discussions with the family about the need for intubation, nasogastric tube placement, and possibly hemodialysis. However, the patient has decided to focus on comfort measures only, including morphine for respiratory distress.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is multifactorial and may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, ICU delirium, or infection. Discontinuing lactulose and providing supportive care measures are recommended.
2. Hypotension/tachycardia/hypothermia: The patient's symptoms may be related to sepsis secondary to pulmonary infection or adrenal insufficiency. Continuing vancomycin, cefipime, and flagyl while discontinuing midodrine and dex are advised. The use of a bear hugger for hypothermia management is also recommended.
3. Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient has likely multifactorial acute kidney injury, including pre-renal hypovolem"
