   distress found to be profoundly hypertensive, evidence of aspiration on
   CT chest and rising CEs
   .
   1)       Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting
   of worsening cardiac function and hypertension versus aspiration
   pneumonia, or a combination of both.
   For worsening cardiac function:
   -cycled enzymes and has Ruled In for MI
   -echo shows depressed LVEF that we [**Male First Name (un) **]
t know if new but could
   represent effects of ischemia
   -EKG shows LBBB that we [**Male First Name (un) **]
t know is new, again could represent ACS
   -continued on aspirin, plavix, statin (increase to 80)
   -on IV heparin
   -need outside records to compare
   -cardiology aware and may take to cath
   -metformin being held
   For pulmonary edema
   -can give boluses of lasix throughout day and see how responds in terms
   of output and BP
   2) Aspiration PNA - Febrile with WBC count elevated at 27 on initial
   labs, now trending down likely after fluid resuscitation. Aspiration
   PNA read based on appearance on CT Chest.
   -Start vanc, cefepime, ciprofloxacin
   -Trending WBC
   - sputum cultures
   - blood cultures
   .
   3) Acute renal failure - Resolved with IVFs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of presumed coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with respiratory distress. He was found to be profoundly hypertensive, with evidence of aspiration on CT chest and rising cardiac enzymes.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise, including hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), acute renal failure, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: This could be due to pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening cardiac function and hypertension versus aspiration pneumonia, or a combination of both. The patient's low oxygen saturation level (SpO2: 97%) indicates a potential respiratory issue.

2. Aspiration PNA: The patient has evidence of aspiration on CT chest and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. The patient is being started on antibiotics (vanc, cefepime, ciprofloxacin) and cultures are being obtained.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's initial creatinine level was 1.3, which improved to 1.1. He is being managed with IV hydration and his creatinine levels will be trended. Holding medications such as metformin, glyburide, and lisinopril.

4. DM: The patient's diabetes is being managed with SSC insulin.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of these potential medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of presumed coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with respiratory distress. He was found to be profoundly hypertensive and showed evidence of aspiration on a chest CT scan. The patient's cardiac enzymes (CEs) are rising, indicating possible myocardial injury or ischemia. He has an unknown baseline left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient denies chest pain but is partially sedated.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient is suspected of having ACS, possibly in the setting of a hypertensive emergency and flash pulmonary edema. Troponin and creatine kinase (CK) levels are rising since presentation to the hospital. The patient has been started on intravenous heparin, and a cardiac catheterization is planned for today. Additional medications include aspirin and clopidogrel. Troponin levels will be cycled three times, and an echocardiogram will be obtained to look for myocardial wall abnormalities.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia (PNA): The patient is febrile with an elevated white blood cell count, which is now trending down likely after fluid resuscitation. Aspiration PNA is read based on the appearance on the CT chest. The patient has been started on vancomycin, cefepime, and"

   .
   Cardiac cath [**10-28**]
   1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
   revealed
   single vessel disease with in stent occlusion of the LCX.  The LMCA had
   no angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.  The LAD had minor
   luminal irregularities but no focal stenoses.  The mid to distal LAD
   was
   a very small caliber vessel.  The LCX was occluded in the region of the
   prior stents.  The RCA had minor luminal irregularities and was a
   dominant vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated diastolic dysfunction (LVEDP 35 mm
   Hg), moderate pulmonary hypertension (PA pressure 36/22 mm Hg),
   elevated
   right sided filling pressures (RVEDP 21 mm Hg), and elevated left sided
   filling pressures (PCWP 22 mg Hg). The cardiac index was normal.  There
   was no inappropriate step up of oxygen saturation from the SVC to the
   PA and therefore no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  There was no
   evidence of constrictive or restrictive cardiomyopathy.
   3. Left ventriculogram done from [**Doctor Last Name **] and LAO projections showed global
   hypokinesis,  increased volume of LV, and no mitral regurgitation.
   4. . . .
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
   3. Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.
   4. Moderate primary pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Acute posterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
   6. PTCA of  vessel.

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Titrate up Metoprolol from 12.5 mg po bid as HR and SBP tolerates.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - Trend cardiac biomarkers until MB peak.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear based on current records if this was
   hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure, but likely hypoxic given CT
   demonstrating bibasilar consolidations. Most likely etiology at this
   time is acute pulmonary edema given elevated filling pressures and PCWP
   suggestive of elevated right and left-sided filling pressures in
   setting of ACS with possible additional component of aspiration
   pneumonia versus pneumonitis.
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB -1-2 L
   - Wean ventilation and extubated today if possible
   - Cover with amp/sulbactam for aspiration event as patient does not
   have any HAP risk factors.
   - Follow-up sputum sensitivities and blood cultures.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I today as above.
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Continue monitoring on
   telemetry.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC with left shift suggestive of either
   infectious process or reactive leukocytosis [**2-24**] ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, culture data.
   - f/u repeat CXR read today.
   .
   # Anemia: Most recent hematocrit of 31.1 from 36 on admission after
   fluid rescucitation with unknown baseline.  Hct stable overnight.
   - Trend hct
   - Obtain PCP records for baseline hct.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated, will continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.
   - When extubated and off sedation, CIWA protocol with valium.

   CCU ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I concur
   with the history, physical, assessment and plan as outlined above.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who developed very late stent
   thrombosis following placement of two overlapping TAXUS stents.
   Successful PCI was performed with balloon angioplasty alone yesterday.
   Right and left heart catheterization showed elevated right and left
   heart pressures with a dilated cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.
   He was extubated this morning and he is doing well.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.
   Appropriate medications including beta blockers and ACE inhibitors will
   be started for his cardiomyopathy.
   Plan was discussed with the patient.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was admitted for respiratory failure, and it is unclear whether it was hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure. The CT scan showed bibasilar consolidations, suggesting acute pulmonary edema. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. 

2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The cardiac catheterization revealed single vessel disease with in-stent occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCX). There was also evidence of diastolic and systolic ventricular dysfunction, as well as moderate pulmonary hypertension.

3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with a left shift, which could indicate an infectious process or reactive leukocytosis associated with acute coronary syndrome. There is also mention of a pending sputum culture to identify any potential pathogens.

4. Anemia: The patient's most recent hematocrit level was 31.1, which is lower than the baseline of 36 on admission. This could be due to fluid resuscitation or ongoing blood loss. 

5. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are persistently elevated, indicating transaminitis. The etiology is uncertain at this time, but it could be related"

   Cardiac cath [**10-28**]
   1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
   revealed
   single vessel disease with in stent occlusion of the LCX.  The LMCA had
   no angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.  The LAD had minor
   luminal irregularities but no focal stenoses.  The mid to distal LAD
   was
   a very small caliber vessel.  The LCX was occluded in the region of the
   prior stents.  The RCA had minor luminal irregularities and was a
   dominant vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated diastolic dysfunction (LVEDP 35 mm
   Hg), moderate pulmonary hypertension (PA pressure 36/22 mm Hg),
   elevated
   right sided filling pressures (RVEDP 21 mm Hg), and elevated left sided
   filling pressures (PCWP 22 mg Hg). The cardiac index was normal.  There
   was no inappropriate step up of oxygen saturation from the SVC to the
   PA and therefore no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  There was no
   evidence of constrictive or restrictive cardiomyopathy.
   3. Left ventriculogram done from [**Doctor Last Name **] and LAO projections showed global
   hypokinesis,  increased volume of LV, and no mitral regurgitation.
   4. . . .
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
   3. Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.
   4. Moderate primary pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Acute posterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Titrate up Metoprolol from 12.5 mg po bid as HR and SBP tolerates.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - Trend cardiac biomarkers until MB peak.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear based on current records if this was
   hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure, but likely hypoxic given CT
   demonstrating bibasilar consolidations. Most likely etiology at this
   time is acute pulmonary edema given elevated filling pressures and PCWP
   suggestive of elevated right and left-sided filling pressures in
   setting of ACS with possible additional component of aspiration
   pneumonia versus pneumonitis.
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB -1-2 L
   - Wean ventilation and extubated today if possible
   - Cover with amp/sulbactam for aspiration event as patient does not
   have any HAP risk factors.
   - Follow-up sputum sensitivities and blood cultures.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I today as above.
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Continue monitoring on
   telemetry.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC with left shift suggestive of either
   infectious process or reactive leukocytosis [**2-24**] ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, culture data.
   - f/u repeat CXR read today.
   .
   # Anemia: Most recent hematocrit of 31.1 from 36 on admission after
   fluid rescucitation with unknown baseline.  Hct stable overnight.
   - Trend hct
   - Obtain PCP records for baseline hct.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated, will continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.
   - When extubated and off sedation, CIWA protocol with valium.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2) who was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization with thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCX) stent. The patient's current condition includes one-vessel coronary artery disease, moderate diastolic and systolic ventricular dysfunction, moderate primary pulmonary hypertension, acute posterior myocardial infarction managed by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and thrombosis of the LCX stent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which could be due to hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure. The most likely etiology appears to be acute pulmonary edema, possibly associated with aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has moderate diastolic and systolic ventricular dysfunction, indicating impaired heart function. There is also evidence of pulmonary hypertension, which may increase the risk of right-sided heart failure.
3. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis with a left shift suggests an infectious process or reactive leukocytosis secondary to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It is important to monitor for fever and culture data.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an NSTEMI. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and recent NSTEMI. There is a risk of recurrent myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and heart failure due to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has respiratory failure, likely secondary to acute pulmonary edema and aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. There is a risk of worsening hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with a left shift, suggesting an infectious process or reactive leukocytosis. There is a risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and underlying hypercoagulable state.

   secondary to tachycardia induced BBB which the patient has had
   previously.  He was treated with multiple doses of valium and ativan
   for presumed alcohol withdrawl and concern for delirium tremens.  With
   increasing frequency of valium, pts hemodynamics did not stabilize and
   developed hypoxic respiratory failure leading to intubation.  Pt was
   briefly treated with a nitro gtt which was weaned off when pressures
   stabilized.  Versed gtt was simultaneously started and titrated to

   CCU COMPREHENSIVE PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the History, Physical, and Medical Decision Making.   Mr.
   [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who developed very late stent thrombosis
   following placement of two overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI
   was performed with balloon angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left
   heart catheterization showed elevated right and left heart pressures
   with a dilated cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have now learned that
   the cardiomyopathy is of longstanding duration.
   After an initial period of extubation, the patient developed
   hypertension, tachycardia, and fevers consistent with alcohol
   withdrawal syndrome.  He was treated with IV benzodiazapines.  He
   ultimately required intubation of hypoxemia due to his underlying
   aspiration pneumonia.  He has been given vitamins with his IVFs.  We
   will rest him today on the ventilatory and aim toward extubation in the
   AM should his condition stabilize.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2). He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which has since been treated with PCI and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent.

The patient's current condition includes delirium tremens, likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal, for which he is being treated with benzodiazepines. He also has a fever and leukocytosis, possibly due to pneumonia or reactive leukocytosis related to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Respiratory failure is present, with hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash pulmonary edema or pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as indicated by a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), although the V-gram suggests 30%. This suggests reduced cardiac output. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, possibly due to alcohol consumption or other factors.

The patient has a history of CAD with recent stent thrombosis, which required PCI and thrombectomy. He is currently on"

   Overnight, pt became tachycardic, hypertensive and developed
   wide-complex QRS waves on EKG.  These waves were thought to be
   secondary to tachycardia induced BBB which the patient has had
   previously.  He was treated with multiple doses of valium and ativan
   for presumed alcohol withdrawl and concern for delirium tremens.  With
   increasing frequency of valium, pts hemodynamics did not stabilize and
   developed hypoxic respiratory failure leading to intubation.  Pt was
   briefly treated with a nitro gtt which was weaned off when pressures
   stabilized.  Versed gtt was simultaneously started and titrated to
   control his hemodynamic state.  Additionally, pt was given a banana
   bag.

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 159/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a non-rebreather mask and endotracheal tube. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.8 g/dL, blood glucose level of 149 mg/dL, and creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 mg/dL. The troponin-T level is elevated at 1670 U/L, indicating myocardial injury. Other lab values include elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosph"

   Overnight, pt became tachycardic, hypertensive and developed
   wide-complex QRS waves on EKG.  These waves were thought to be
   secondary to tachycardia induced BBB which the patient has had
   previously.  He was treated with multiple doses of valium and ativan
   for presumed alcohol withdrawl and concern for delirium tremens.  With
   increasing frequency of valium, pts hemodynamics did not stabilize and
   developed hypoxic respiratory failure leading to intubation.  Pt was
   briefly treated with a nitro gtt which was weaned off when pressures
   stabilized.  Versed gtt was simultaneously started and titrated to
   control his hemodynamic state.  Additionally, pt was given a banana
   bag.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2). The patient was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), following which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Delirium tremens: The patient is intubated and receiving sedation with benzodiazepines to stabilize hemodynamics.
2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has undergone PCI and thrombus extraction of the LCx stent. He is prescribed aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin for long-term management.
3. Fever and leukocytosis: The likely etiology is pneumonia (PNA), but there is also concern for reactive leukocytosis secondary to acute chest syndrome (ACS). Antibiotics have been continued, and pan-culture has been obtained.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is stabilized on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly due to flash pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Weaning of the ventilator will be done as tolerated, and diuresis with Lasix will be administered to manage pulmonary edema.
5. Cardiac function: The patient's left vent"

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I concur
   with the History, Physical, and Medical Decision Making.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9287**]: Documented by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have now learned that the
   cardiomyopathy is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed
   acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of
   benzodiazepidine.
   After an initial period of stabilization, he required re-intubation for
   worsening hypoxemia.   He developed a fever to 102 today and we have
   broadened his antibiotic coverage.   We will continue to rest him today
   on the ventilatory today and aim toward extubation in the AM should his
   condition stabilize.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2).
- He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an NSTEMI.
- The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent.
- He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in assist-control mode.
- The patient has developed a fever and leucocytosis, but his urine culture shows no growth.
- He also has delirium tremens, which is being managed with benzodiazepines.
- The patient has a history of CAD, with recent PCI and thrombectomy.
- His left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 40%.
- There are concerns about flash pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.
- The patient's rhythm is currently sinus with 1:1 conduction and right bundle branch block (RBBB) when tachycardic.
- He has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 29.3 g/dL.
- There is transaminitis with elevated AST and ALT levels.
- The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with SSI.

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: Pt still febrile despite being on Unasyn for
   presumed aspiration PNA based on initial imaging, but with no
   leukocytosis.   Recent UA markedly positive, but UCx shows no growth to
   date.  Will pan culture again today as pt 102 this morning and broaden
   antibiotic coverage.
   - Repeat BCx, UCx, sputum cx
   - d/c Unasyn
   - Initiate Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone for double coverage;  if cultures
   negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Uptitrated Midazolam overnight in the setting of
   discontinuing prn Valium doses, currently appropriately sedated.
   -Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic
   stability
   -d/c Valium
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - CPAP trial; wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB even- (-)500 today
   - Cover with antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA, as no clinical
   improvement on Unasyn
   - Repeat CXR
   - Repeat sputum cxs today
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardia.  Monitor on tele.
   ..
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated but essentially stable from yesterday, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which was treated with catheterization and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent.

The patient has been experiencing fever and leucocytosis, despite being on Unasyn for presumed aspiration pneumonia. His recent urinalysis was markedly positive, but urine culture shows no growth to date. He is currently febrile at 102°F and will undergo pan culture again today. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated.

The patient also has delirium tremens, which is being managed with benzodiazepines. His cardiac status includes CAD, and he underwent PTCA and thrombus extraction of the stent in the LCx. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. He is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, as well as statin therapy.

Respiratory failure is a concern, with hypoxic respiratory failure possibly due to flash pulmonary edema or pneumonia. The patient has been stabilized on mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: Abx coverage broadened yesterday, pan cultured
   given fevers over the last 24 hrs.  Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise
   no + cxs.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue  Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone for double coverage;  if cultures
   negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone.  Will add flagyl for gram
   coverage out of concern for aspiration event.
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Was able to decrease Midazolam doses o/n.
   -Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic
   stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - ABG this afternoon, wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal TBB even- (-)500 today
   - Cover with antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardia.  Monitor on tele.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated but essentially stable from yesterday, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.

   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have now learned that the
   cardiomyopathy is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed
   acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of
   benzodiazepidine.
   After an initial period of stabilization, he required re-intubation for
   worsening hypoxemia.  After having been treated for aspiration and
   community acquired pneumonia, he has continued with low grade fevers
   although his WBC remains normal.   We will further broader his
   antibiotic coverage with Flagyl with evidence of ongoing infection.
   We will continue ventilatory support today and push diuresis.  We will
   continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg twice daily
   for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely thereafter.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an NSTEMI, which was managed with catheterization and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent.

The patient's current condition includes fever and leukocytosis, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. He also has delirium tremens, likely due to ethanol withdrawal, and his hemodynamics are stable with intubation and sedation. The patient underwent PCI and thrombus extraction of the stent in the LCx artery. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%.

The patient's respiratory failure is concerning for flash pulmonary edema versus pneumonia. He is currently stabilized on mechanical ventilation. The plan includes weaning off the vent as tolerated, diuresis with Lasix to achieve a target blood volume even (-)500 mL, and coverage with antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia. Re-culture will be done if fevers persist.

Other assessments and plans include management for CAD, with continued metoprolol at a lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID and res"

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: Pt still febrile despite being on Unasyn for
   presumed aspiration PNA based on initial imaging, but with no
   leukocytosis.   Recent UA markedly positive, but UCx shows no growth to
   date.  Will pan culture again today as pt 102 this morning and broaden
   antibiotic coverage.
   - Repeat BCx, UCx, sputum cx
   - d/c Unasyn
   - Initiate Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone for double coverage;  if cultures
   negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Uptitrated Midazolam overnight in the setting of
   discontinuing prn Valium doses, currently appropriately sedated.
   -Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic
   stability
   -d/c Valium
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - CPAP trial; wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB even- (-)500 today
   - Cover with antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA, as no clinical
   improvement on Unasyn
   - Repeat CXR
   - Repeat sputum cxs today
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardia.  Monitor on tele.
   ..
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated but essentially stable from yesterday, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old gentleman with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2). He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which required percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent.

The patient's current conditions include fever, leucocytosis, delirium tremens, acute kidney injury (AKI), congestive heart failure (CHF), respiratory failure, and anemia. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been febrile despite antibiotic treatment for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures will be repeated.

2. Delirium tremens: The patient is showing signs of delirium, which may be due to alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines have been titrated for sedation, and Valium has been discontinued.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 35.1% to 29.3% overnight, indicating possible blood loss. Active transfusion support has been initiated for a hematocrit (Hct) less than 28 in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

   # Fever/leucocytosis: Pt still febrile despite being on Unasyn for
   presumed aspiration PNA based on initial imaging, but with no
   leukocytosis.   Recent UA markedly positive, but UCx shows no growth to
   date.  Will pan culture again today as pt 102 this morning and broaden
   antibiotic coverage.
   - Repeat BCx, UCx, sputum cx
   - d/c Unasyn
   - Initiate Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone for double coverage;  if cultures

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2). He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an NSTEMI. The patient underwent catheterization with thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent.

Current Assessment and Plan:

1. Fever/leucocytosis: The patient still has a fever despite being on Unasyn for presumed aspiration pneumonia (PNA). Recent urinalysis (UA) was markedly positive, but urine culture (UCx) shows no growth. Pan cultures will be repeated today, and antibiotic coverage will be broadened.

2. Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics are stable with intubation and sedation with benzodiazepines. Midazolam infusion has been titrated overnight in the setting of discontinuing prn Valium doses, currently appropriately sedated. Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic stability. Discontinue Valium.

3. CAD: The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and thrombus extraction of the stent in the LCx. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%. Given Integrillin x18 hours following catheterization.

4. Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash pulmonary edema vs PNA. Stabilized on mechanical ventilation. CPAP trial; wean vent as tolerated. Diurese with Lasix prn, goal tidal volume (TBB) even- (-)500 today. Cover with antibiotics as above for?aspiration PNA, as no clinical improvement on Unasyn. Repeat chest X-ray (CXR) and sputum cultures today.

5. Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema. Diurese as above. Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE inhibitor when pressures stabilize. Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.

6. Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with right bundle branch block (RBBB) when tachycardia. Monitor on telemetry.

7. Anemia: Hematocrit (Hct) stable, 35.1 -> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable at 29.3, suspect yesterday's Hct was a spurious result. Will repeat Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily. Active T+S, transfuse for Hct <28 given acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the History, Physical, and Assessment and Treatment Plan.
   My examination was performed in the present of the housestaff and the
   above note documents this examination.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was unable to tolerate coming
   off his benzodiazepines due to agitation and his IV sedation was
   reinstituted.  His note writing was somewhat non sensical.  He moves
   all extremities.
   Physical: Documented by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6192**].  He still shows signs of volume
   overload as manifest by his low paO2 = 55 on FIO2 = 40%.
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have now learned that the
   cardiomyopathy is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed
   acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of
   benzodiazepidine.
   After an initial period of stabilization, he required re-intubation for
   worsening hypoxemia.  After having been treated for aspiration and
   community acquired pneumonia.  His antibiotic coverage was broadened
   yesterday with the addition of Flagyl.  He continues to spike
   temperatures to 101.5 although his WBC has remained normal.   He did
   not tolerate attempts at weaning the ventilator.  We will continue
   ventilatory support again today and force diuresis.  Our fluid goals
   are negative 1-2 liters daily.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which led to the placement of a stent in the left circumflex artery. The patient subsequently developed stent thrombosis and required percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty. He also has a history of alcohol use and withdrawal symptoms.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever with a temperature of 101.3°F
- Increased limb movement and facial feature changes
- Production of white sputum
- Normal white blood cell count
- Mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%
- Mild pulmonary edema
- Hypoxic respiratory failure
- Flash pulmonary edema or possible pneumonia
- Negative fluid balance goal of -1 to -1.5 liters per day
- Intubated and on mechanical ventilation
- Sedated with benzodiazepines
- Agitation and delirium tremens

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and production of white sputum may indicate an infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection is still uncertain, with possibilities including pneumonia, aspiration, or drug-related fever"

   Radiology: Most recent CXR 10/9/9 - Small bilateral layering pleural
   effusions with mild pulmonary edema are unchanged since the previous
   chest radiograph.
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl.
   .
   # Fever: Abx coverage broadened to quadruple coverage, pan-cultured
   given fevers. Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise no + cxs. WBC 7.8
   today (overall a downwards trend since admission). Consider drug fever
   versus pneumonia versus other infection versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl;  if cultures negative
   x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   - monitor WBC count
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Currently slightly agitated off of
   fentanyl/versed for an hour.
   -Restart, if needed, Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and
   hemodynamic stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - Wean vent as tolerated today; possibly extubation is looks
   appropriate
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal: negative 1L to 1.5L today
   - Extra dose of 500 mg IV diuril now to help with diuresis
   - Cover with 4 antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count
   - ABG to get a sense for ventilator settings appropriateness
   - SBT this morning
   - CXR post-extubation
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above; goal negative 1 to 1.5L today; via lasix drip and
   one-time diuril dose this AM with repeat PRN
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl.
   .
   # Fever: Abx coverage broadened to quadruple coverage, pan-cultured
   given fevers. Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise no + cxs. WBC 7.8
   today (overall a downwards trend since admission). Consider drug fever
   versus pneumonia versus other infection versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl;  if cultures negative
   x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   - monitor WBC count
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Currently slightly agitated off of
   fentanyl/versed for an hour.
   -Restart, if needed, Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and
   hemodynamic stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - Wean vent as tolerated today; possibly extubation is looks
   appropriate
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal: negative 1L to 1.5L today
   - Extra dose of 500 mg IV diuril now to help with diuresis
   - Cover with 4 antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count
   - ABG to get a sense for ventilator settings appropriateness
   - SBT this morning
   - CXR post-extubation
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above; goal negative 1 to 1.5L today; via lasix drip and
   one-time diuril dose this AM with repeat PRN
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday

","The patient is a 49-year-old gentleman with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2). He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which was managed with catheterization and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent. He is also being managed for ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal.

The patient has been intubated and sedated with benzodiazepines due to delirium tremens. His hemodynamics are stable, but he remains agitated. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. There is concern for flash pulmonary edema versus pneumonia. His sputum culture shows rare gram-positive cocci, but no other significant findings.

The patient's cardiac function has been assessed, showing mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with an ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. The patient has been started on aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (Plavix), atorvastatin, and metoprolol, and will resume home lisinopril when his pressures are stable and sedation is weaned off.

His renal function is within normal limits, but he has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl.
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: Abx coverage broadened to triple coverage,
   pan-cultured given fevers. Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise no + cxs.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl for double coverage;  if
   cultures negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone.
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Was able to decrease Midazolam doses o/n.
   -Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic
   stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - ABG this afternoon, wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal: even- (-)500 today
   - Cover with antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on tele.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated but essentially stable from yesterday, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old gentleman with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2). The patient was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which was managed by catheterization with thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent. The patient is also being managed for ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and broadened antibiotic coverage has been initiated due to suspected infection. Sputum culture showed rare gram-positive cocci (GPCs), but no other significant findings. Cultures will be followed, and if negative within 48 hours, ceftriaxone may be discontinued.

2. Delirium tremens (DTs): The patient's delirium has been stabilized with intubation and sedation using benzodiazepines. Midazolam doses have been decreased overnight, and the patient will continue on midazolam and fentanyl infusions, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic stability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Would check mini-BAL for gram stain and culture.
2. Would obtain neurologic imaging (MRI) to evaluate for underlying neurologic d
isease and possible central etiology of
fevers.
3. Would check amylase, lipase, full set of LFTs to evaluate for pancreatitis an
d for acalculous cholecystitis (and would have a low-threshold for obtaining [**Name (NI) **]
 sono).
4. Consider line changes, given that his lines are approximately 7 days old [**Company 2742**]
his point, although given the time course of his fevers, this is somewhat less l
ikely.
5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a
lthough this seems unlikely given that the fevers have been persistent throughou
t his hospitalization.
6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full
y imaging head.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which was managed with catheterization and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent. The patient also underwent ethanol withdrawal management. His course has been complicated by altered mental status, reintubation, and difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to decreased clearing of secretions and hypoxia.

The patient's current condition includes persistent fevers despite being on four antibiotics, a downward trend in white blood cell count, and no positive cultures. The patient's respiratory failure has been stabilized, and he has been extubated. There is concern for flash pulmonary edema versus pneumonia. The patient's cardiac condition includes mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. He has been started on appropriate cardiac medications.

Other medical conditions include delirium tremens (DTs), anemia, transaminitis (elevated liver function tests), diabetes mellitus type 2, ethanol withdrawal, and dermatologic concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious etiologies such as pneumonia or central line-associated bloodstream infection.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Would check mini-BAL for gram stain and culture.
2. Would obtain neurologic imaging (MRI) to evaluate for underlying neurologic d
isease and possible central etiology of
fevers.
3. Would check amylase, lipase, full set of LFTs to evaluate for pancreatitis an
d for acalculous cholecystitis (and would have a low-threshold for obtaining [**Name (NI) **]
 sono).
4. Consider line changes, given that his lines are approximately 7 days old [**Company 2742**]
his point, although given the time course of his fevers, this is somewhat less l
ikely.
5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a
lthough this seems unlikely given that the fevers have been persistent throughou
t his hospitalization.
6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which required cardiac catheterization and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, re-intubation, and difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to decreased clearing of secretions and hypoxia. He is being managed for ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal.

The potential medical complications and considerations mentioned in the progress note include:

1. Fever: The patient's fevers persist despite being on four antibiotics. Sputum culture showed rare gram-positive cocci, but no positive cultures otherwise. The WBC count is trending downwards. Considerations include drug fever, pneumonia, other infectious sources, or withdrawal syndrome.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient stabilized on the ventilator, but there is concern for flash pulmonary edema versus pneumonia. The patient's lungs sounds clear, and the chest X-ray (CXR) looks clear. The creatinine level increased due to diuresis, but it is believed to be appropriate. The goal is to achieve even to -500mL fluid balance using lasix as needed.

non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full
y imaging head.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl; course complicated by
   re-intubation, but now extubated (on [**11-3**]) and breathing comfortably.
   .
   # Fever: Fevers persisting, despite being on 4 antibiotics. Sputum
   showed rare GPCs in one sample, otherwise no + cultures. WBC 8.8 today
   (overall a downwards trend since admission; stable for approximately 4
   days now). Consider drug fever versus pneumonia versus other infectious
   source (LFTs elevated but stable/downtrending; altered mental status
   seems sedation-related but could be neurological process; no diarrhea;
   CXR clear; rash does not seem so severe as to be causing these fevers)
   versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - Appreciate & f/u ID recs
   - F/U cultures
   - Discontinue Cefepime, Vancomycin
   - Continue flagyl, but at c.diff dosing, until c.diff negative
   - F/U c.diff test
   - F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent. Diuresed to point where
   lungs sounds clear, CXR looks clear, and Cr bumped
 believe diuresis
   appropriate now. Was 1.6L positive over past 24 hours. Extubated
   yesterday. Significantly improved respiratory status today. Patient
   reports chronic dry cough.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   (hopefully in
s shouldn
t be as great, now that d/c
ing multiple IV
   antibiotics)
   - Re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count;
   re-image lungs if respiratory status changes
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, metoprolol
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily, perhaps tomorrow
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema
 now believe
   fluid overload has resolved.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   (perhaps tomorrow)
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with LBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Mental status: Previously confused, believed to be d/t DT
s, but now
   outside that timeframe window. Still with some confusion (ie: visual,
   seeing a bag that wasn
t there) and also quite repetitive and
   circuitous in conversation (unclear if this is his baseline?)
   - Monitor mental status
   .
   # Anemia: Hct improved at 34.6 today. No evidence of bleed, will trend
   daily.
   - Transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although previously
   AST>ALT somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history. LFTs
   stable/downtrending over past couple of days. No abdominal pain.
   - F/U CT abdomen & pelvis
   - F/U hepatitis viral studies
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .
   # DM 2: Now that patient on regular (heart-healthy) diet, as opposed to
   tube feeds, will monitor blood sugars and adjust medication regimen as
   needed (not on insulin at home).
   - Monitor blood sugars
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), diabetes mellitus type 2, and ethanol withdrawal. He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which was managed with catheterization and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent. The patient is also being managed for ethanol withdrawal. His current condition includes persistent fevers despite being on four different antibiotics, clear chest X-ray, and no evidence of pneumonia. The patient's white blood cell count is decreasing, indicating a possible improvement in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's persistent fevers, despite being on four different antibiotics, suggest a potential non-infectious cause. Further evaluation is required to determine the underlying cause of the fever.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which was initially managed with ventilation and diuresis. Since extubation, the patient's respiratory status has significantly improved.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, and recent management included PCI and thrombectomy of the LCx stent. Ongoing monitoring and management are necessary to assess cardiac function and prevent further complications.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed appropriately, considering his recent"

   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl; course complicated by altered
   mental status, re-intubation, and difficulty weaning off the vent
   yesterday (secondary to decreased clearing of secretions and hypoxia).
   .
   # Fever: Fevers persisting, despite being on 4 antibiotics. Sputum
   showed rare GPCs in one sample, otherwise no + cultures. WBC 8.8 today
   (overall a downwards trend since admission; stable for approximately 4
   days now). Consider drug fever versus pneumonia versus other infectious
   source (LFTs elevated but stable/downtrending; altered mental status
   seems sedation-related but could be neurological process; no diarrhea;
   CXR clear; rash does not seem so severe as to be causing these fevers)
   versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - follow cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin (since [**10-31**]) / Cefepime (since [**10-31**]) / Flagyl
   (since [**11-1**])
   - F/U CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve
   - Consider neuro consult and/or repeat CT scan/MRI of head

   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent. Diuresed to point where
   lungs sounds clear, CXR looks clear, and Cr bumped
 believe diuresis
   appropriate now. Was 1.6L positive over past 24 hours. Extubated
   yesterday.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   - Cover with 3 antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, metoprolol
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]

   weaned off

 now believe
   fluid overload has resolved.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)

   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.

5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a

6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat

drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul

7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the History, Physical, and Assessment and Treatment Plan.
   My examination was performed in the present of the housestaff and the
   above note documents this examination.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He is now extubated and reasonably
   oriented.
   Physical: Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have learned that the cardiomyopathy
   is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed acute alcohol
   withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of benzodiazepidine.
   After extubation, his fevers seemed to have improved and we are
   reducing his antibiotic regimen given the negative cultures.  He is
   positive yesterday and we are aiming toward being negative today.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

He also had an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was managed for ethanol withdrawal. The patient's course has been complicated by re-intubation, but he is now extubated and breathing comfortably.

The patient's current assessment includes:
1. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers despite being on four antibiotics. Sputum culture showed rare gram-positive cocci in one sample, with no positive cultures. The WBC count is trending downwards, indicating a possible improvement in the infection. However, other infectious sources, drug fever, or withdrawal syndrome should be considered.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had hypoxic respiratory failure, which was stabilized with ventilation. He was diagnosed with flash pulmonary edema versus pneumonia and was diuresed appropriately. His respiratory status has significantly improved, and he is now extubated.
3. CAD: The patient underwent PCI and thrombus extraction of the stent in the left circumflex artery. An echocardiogram showed mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%.
4. Pump failure: The patient had pulmonary edema, which is believed to have resolved.

drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full
y imaging head.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl; course complicated by
   re-intubation, but now extubated (on [**11-3**]) and breathing comfortably.
   .
   # Fever: Fevers persisting, despite being on 4 antibiotics. Sputum
   showed rare GPCs in one sample, otherwise no + cultures. WBC 8.8 today
   (overall a downwards trend since admission; stable for approximately 4
   days now). Consider drug fever versus pneumonia versus other infectious
   source (LFTs elevated but stable/downtrending; altered mental status
   seems sedation-related but could be neurological process; no diarrhea;
   CXR clear; rash does not seem so severe as to be causing these fevers)
   versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - Appreciate & f/u ID recs
   - F/U cultures
   - Discontinue Cefepime, Vancomycin
   - Continue flagyl, but at c.diff dosing, until c.diff negative
   - F/U c.diff test
   - F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent. Diuresed to point where
   lungs sounds clear, CXR looks clear, and Cr bumped
 believe diuresis
   appropriate now. Was 1.6L positive over past 24 hours. Extubated
   yesterday. Significantly improved respiratory status today. Patient
   reports chronic dry cough.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   (hopefully in
s shouldn
t be as great, now that d/c
ing multiple IV
   antibiotics)
   - Re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count;
   re-image lungs if respiratory status changes
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, metoprolol
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily, perhaps tomorrow
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema
 now believe
   fluid overload has resolved.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   (perhaps tomorrow)
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with LBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Mental status: Previously confused, believed to be d/t DT
s, but now
   outside that timeframe window. Still with some confusion (ie: visual,
   seeing a bag that wasn
t there) and also quite repetitive and
   circuitous in conversation (unclear if this is his baseline?)
   - Monitor mental status
   .
   # Anemia: Hct improved at 34.6 today. No evidence of bleed, will trend
   daily.
   - Transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although previously
   AST>ALT somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history. LFTs
   stable/downtrending over past couple of days. No abdominal pain.
   - F/U CT abdomen & pelvis
   - F/U hepatitis viral studies
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .
   # DM 2: Now that patient on regular (heart-healthy) diet, as opposed to
   tube feeds, will monitor blood sugars and adjust medication regimen as
   needed (not on insulin at home).
   - Monitor blood sugars
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.
   .
   # Dermatologic: rash = macular, bilateral axillae
 concern contact
   dermatitis versus fungal
   -miconazole powder application
   -monitor clinically

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the History, Physical, and Assessment and Treatment Plan.
   My examination was performed in the present of the housestaff and the
   above note documents this examination.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He is now extubated and reasonably
   oriented.
   Physical: Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have learned that the cardiomyopathy
   is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed acute alcohol
   withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of benzodiazepidine.
   After extubation, his fevers seemed to have improved and we are
   reducing his antibiotic regimen given the negative cultures.  He is
   positive yesterday and we are aiming toward being negative today.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an NSTEMI, which was managed with catheterization and thrombectomy of a previously placed coronary stent. The patient also had ethanol withdrawal and was extubated yesterday.

Current issues:
1. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers despite being on four different antibiotics. Sputum culture showed rare gram-positive cocci, but no other positive cultures. The WBC count is stable and trending downwards. It is important to consider drug fever, pneumonia, or other infectious sources as the cause of the fever.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient had hypoxic respiratory failure, which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema or pneumonia. He was stabilized on the ventilator and diuresed to clear the lungs. He is now extubated and has significantly improved respiratory status. The patient reports a chronic dry cough.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient had mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. There is also a concern for fluid overload, which has been addressed.
4. Mental status: The patient was previously confused, believed to be due to delirium tremens (DTs). He now has some confusion, visual hallucinations,"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Fever: The patient has a temperature of 99 degrees, which is above the normal range. The WBC count is also trending down, indicating a possible infection. The patient may develop a more severe infection if not treated appropriately.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be due to flash pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Since the patient has been diuresed and is now extubated with improved respiratory status, this complication seems to have been managed effectively.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and underwent PCI and stent placement. There is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis, which can lead to further cardiac complications.

4. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is being managed for EtOH withdrawal. Symptoms of withdrawal may include seizures, tremors, hallucinations, and delirium tremens. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent these complications.

5. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, and it is important to monitor blood sugars closely, especially now that the patient is on a regular diet. Poor glycemic control can lead to hyperglycemic emergencies such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.

6. Dermatologic condition: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an NSTEMI. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization with thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex artery (LCx) stent. He is being managed for ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal, and his course is complicated by re-intubation but now extubated and breathing comfortably.

Potential medical complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a fever with a maximum temperature of 99 degrees. The cause of the fever is unclear and could be due to withdrawal syndrome, drug fever, or aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring the WBC count and fever curve is recommended, and considering discontinuing unnecessary antibiotics.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had hypoxic respiratory failure, which may have been caused by flash pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Diuresis was appropriate, and the patient's respiratory status has significantly improved. However, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of worsening respiratory status and consider re-imaging if necessary.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and recently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with thrombectomy of the LCx stent. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 40%, indicating some impairment in cardiac function. Medications such as aspir"
