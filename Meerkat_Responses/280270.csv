","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis B cirrhosis, who was transferred from another hospital for management of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He has portal vein thrombosis without intervention, encephalopathy, varices, COPD, and hypertension. The patient underwent paracentesis and endoscopy, which revealed esophageal varices, ulcers, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. He received a blood transfusion due to a drop in hematocrit overnight. The patient is currently on multiple medications including octreotide, PPI, ceftriaxone, lactulose, and morphine for pain control. He has elevated liver function tests and direct bilirubin, indicating acute decompensation of his liver disease. The RUQ ultrasound showed cirrhotic liver and occluded portal vein, with questionable echogenic areas around the portal vein that could represent a mass. The patient also has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, likely due to prerenal causes. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/70 to 130/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and sinus tachycardia on ECG. The patient's weight is 94.5 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3820 mL, including 664 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 4125 mL, with 175 mL of NG output. He is on mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 520 mL, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 70%, and PIP of 18 cmH2O. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC, Hct, and platelet count, with decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal limits. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper and lower GI bleeding, which is a common complication in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated ammonia levels and altered mental status suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen with further liver decompensation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which can be due to prerenal causes or hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state and indwelling lines.
5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's COPD and mechanical ventilation put him at risk for pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated lung injury.
6. Variceal hemorrhage: The presence of esophageal varices increases the risk of variceal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
7. Hepatocellular carcinoma: The questionable echogenic areas around the portal vein on ultrasound may represent a mass, which could indicate hepatocellular carcinoma.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and potential for fluid overload increase the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis B cirrhosis, who was transferred to the ICU for management of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He has portal vein thrombosis without intervention, encephalopathy, varices, COPD, and hypertension. The patient underwent paracentesis and endoscopy, which showed hypertensive gastropathy but no gastric varices. He received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K. His hematocrit levels have been stable at 31 for the last 12 hours. The patient is currently on octreotide, proton pump inhibitors, ceftriaxone for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis, and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. He is also receiving IV fluids and has large bore peripheral IV lines. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile, and acute renal failure. Imaging studies reveal cirrhotic liver with occluded portal vein and questionable echogenic areas that could represent a mass. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate 100 bpm, blood pressure 111/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on high-flow nasal cannula.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis B cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU for management of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has multiple medical complications including portal vein thrombosis, encephalopathy, varices, COPD, hypertension, and possible hepatocellular carcinoma.

The patient underwent paracentesis and endoscopy, which showed esophageal varices, ulcers, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. He received a blood transfusion due to a drop in hematocrit overnight.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's physical examination revealed crackles at the bases of the lungs bilaterally, mild wheezes throughout, and a markedly distended abdomen with spider angioma and mild tenderness to palpation.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, bilirubin, liver enzymes, and creatinine. The patient's MELD score is 19.

The patient is currently receiving octreotide for portal hypertensive gastropathy, proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcers, ceftriaxone for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis, lactulose for hepatic en"

   Assessment and Plan
   GI  bleed, cirrhosis
   GI BLEED -- evaluation to date suggests upper source, probable portal
   hypertensive gastropathy rather than esophogeal varices.
   ANEMIA -- secondary to blood loss; maintain Hct > 30.
   ABDOMINAL PAIN -- attributed predominately to expanding ascites,
   possible portal vein thrombosis.  No evidence for SBP. Possible liver
   mass --> evaluation in progress.
   ASCITES -- worsening attributed to portal vein thrombosis.  Additional
   imaging pending, consider repeat large volume paracentesis.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, attributed to large volume paracentesis or
   recent dye load (CT).  Monitor BUN,
   COPD -- mild, maintain MDI.
   HYPOXEMIA -- unlikely attributed to COPD (mild), but may be attributed
   to hepato-pulmonary disease.  Maintain SaO2 >88%.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.  Hope to advance diet.
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- hepatic; continue lactulose.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with a chief complaint of GI bleed. The patient underwent paracentesis, invasive ventilation, and endoscopy. The patient was intubated for the EGD procedure and later extubated. The patient continues to experience diffuse abdominal discomfort, which is relieved with morphine. The patient's allergies, medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission, except for the noted events and findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to large volume paracentesis or recent dye load (CT). Monitoring BUN levels is important to assess kidney function.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, possibly attributed to hepato-pulmonary disease. Maintaining SaO2 >88% is crucial to ensure adequate oxygenation.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss. Maintaining Hct >30 is essential to prevent further complications.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain is attributed to expanding ascites and possible portal vein thrombosis. Evaluation and management of these conditions are necessary.
5. Ascites: The worsening ascites is attributed to portal vein thrombosis. Additional imaging pending, and consideration of repeat large volume paracentesis may be required.
6. Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, for which lactulose is being continued.
7. Nutritional Support: The patient is currently NPO pending evaluation. Advancing the diet once appropriate is important for nutritional support.
8. COPD: The patient has mild COPD, which should be managed with MDI (Medication Device Inhaler).
9. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed is attributed to upper source, likely portal hypertensive gastropathy rather than esophageal varices.
10. Liver Mass: The patient has a possible liver mass, evaluation in progress.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information. Additional assessments and evaluations may be required to provide a comprehensive medical management plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   GI  bleed, cirrhosis
   GI BLEED -- evaluation to date suggests upper source, probable portal
   hypertensive gastropathy rather than esophogeal varices.
   ANEMIA -- secondary to blood loss; maintain Hct > 30.
   ABDOMINAL PAIN -- attributed predominately to expanding ascites,
   possible portal vein thrombosis.  No evidence for SBP. Possible liver
   mass --> evaluation in progress.
   ASCITES -- worsening attributed to portal vein thrombosis.  Additional
   imaging pending, consider repeat large volume paracentesis.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, attributed to large volume paracentesis or
   recent dye load (CT).  Monitor BUN,
   COPD -- mild, maintain MDI.
   HYPOXEMIA -- unlikely attributed to COPD (mild), but may be attributed
   to hepato-pulmonary disease (Hepatopulmonary syndrome).  Maintain SaO2
   >88%.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.  Hope to advance diet.
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- hepatic; continue lactulose.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several potential medical complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to portal hypertensive gastropathy rather than esophageal varices.

2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss from the GI bleed. It is important to maintain the hematocrit (Hct) level above 30.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is primarily attributed to expanding ascites and possible portal vein thrombosis. There is no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Additionally, a liver mass is being evaluated.

4. Ascites: The patient's worsening ascites is attributed to portal vein thrombosis. Further imaging is pending, and a repeat large volume paracentesis may be considered.

5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be attributed to large volume paracentesis or recent dye load (CT). Monitoring of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels is important.

6. COPD: The patient has mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and maintenance of a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) is necessary.

7. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to COPD (mild) or hepato-pulmonary syndrome. It is important to maintain oxygen saturation (SaO2) above 88"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a complex medical history including hepatitis B cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, COPD, hypertension, encephalopathy, and varices. The patient was admitted for upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): The patient has a new diagnosis of HCC. No treatment options are currently available. The oncology team is exploring experimental treatments.

2. Hypertensive Gastropathy: The patient has esophageal varices and ulcers most likely secondary to hypertensive gastropathy. If the bleeding continues, banding may be considered as a treatment option.

3. Hepatitis B Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhotic liver with occluded portal vein. There are questionable echogenic areas around the portal vein that could represent a mass. An MRI at [**Hospital6 **] showed concerns for HCC.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, with an increase in creatinine from 0.8 to 1.9 on admission. It is stable at 1.7 this AM. The cause is likely prerenal due to nausea, emesis, and diarrhea, but hepatorenal syndrome needs to be ruled out.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a complex medical history including hepatitis B cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, encephalopathy, varices, COPD, and hypertension. He was transferred to the ICU for management of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy: The patient's EGD showed esophageal varices and ulcers most likely secondary to hypertensive gastropathy. If bleeding continues, banding may be considered as a treatment option.

2. Hepatitis B Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhotic liver with occluded portal vein and questionable echogenic areas around the portal vein that could represent a mass. There is concern for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An MRI was performed at another hospital, and the primary GI doctor will discuss the diagnosis with the patient.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has mild flap on admission with elevated ammonia levels. Lactulose has been initiated to treat hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.8 to 1.9, but it is now down to 1.7. It is considered as a prerenal etiology due to nausea, emesis, and diarrhea. IV fluids are being continued to maintain hydration.

5. COPD: The patient has underlying COPD and is experiencing wheezing. An ABG analysis will be obtained to assess oxygenation levels. Nebulizers are being increased in frequency, and supplemental oxygen is being provided.

6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, and antihypertensive medications are being withheld during the GI bleed.

7. Potential Intestinal Bleeding: The patient is at risk of further gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require interventions such as banding or other measures to control the bleeding.

8. Anxiety and Depression: The patient is on medications for anxiety and depression, but anxiolytics are being held due to sedating effects in the setting of hepatic encephalopathy.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical symptoms to promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions that can lead to potential complications. These conditions include:

1. GI bleed: The patient is experiencing a gastrointestinal bleed, which can be caused by esophageal varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy. This condition may lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure if not managed properly.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, likely due to Hepatitis B infection. This condition can progress to liver failure and increase the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

3. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has evidence of portal vein thrombosis, which can further worsen liver function and increase the risk of complications such as variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Ascites: The patient is showing signs of increasing ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. This can lead to respiratory distress and infection if not managed appropriately.

5. Pain management: The patient is on morphine for pain relief. Overdose or inadequate pain control can result in respiratory depression and other side effects.

6. Nutritional support: The patient's nutritional status needs to be closely monitored as they are currently NPO (nothing by mouth). Improper nutritional support can lead to malnutrition and worsen overall health outcomes.

7. Liver mass: The patient has a high suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on imaging studies."

   hypertensive gastropathy. MELD score 21 (19 yesterday). Now with new
   diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, no options for treatment. .
   # Hepatocellular carcinoma: No treatment options currently available.
   .# Hypertensive gastropathy: EGD showed esophageal varices and ulcers
   most likely secondary to hypertensive gastropathy.   Bleeding is of
   uncertain etiology.  Possibly from esophageal varices.  Per GI, if
   continues to bleed, consider banding.  TIPS and shunt are not
   feasible.  HCT stable for 24 hours>30.
    -continue octreotide gtt
   -qd HCTs - transfuse for HCT < 25
   -PPI 40mg IV bid until tolerating po
   -continue Ceftriaxone 1g qd for SBP primary prophylaxis
    - active T&S and crossmatch 4 units
   - large bore PIVs
   # Hepatitis B Cirrhosis: c/b portal vein thrombosis without
   intervention. RUQ US showed cirrhotic liver, occluded portal vein.
   Questionable echogenic areas around portal vein that could represent
   mass.  Patient had MRI at [**Hospital6 **].  Concern for HCC.  His
   primary GI doctor Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**] is following and will talk to the patient
   today about the diagnosis.
   - trend LFTs, direct bilirubin -elevated LFTs may be from newly
   activated hep B, ischemic liver, or from hepatoma
   - hepatitis B VL pending
   - appreciate hepatology and GI recs: treatment of portal vein
   thrombosis is too risky
   -paracentesis [**8-7**]: not consistent with SBP -consider abdominal port
   for symptom relief
   # Pain control: Per palliative care, started on MS Contin, Reglan, and
   Morphine elixir for breakthrough pain
   # Infectious: Elevated WBC and fever: Paracentesis negative for SBP.
   Currently on Ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis.  If spikes again, start
   Vanc, Zosyn for SBP.
   -follow up blood cultures.
   -Send C.diff
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Has a mild flap on admission with elevated
   ammonia from OSH
    - lactulose 30 mL TID
   - monitor exam
   # Acute Renal Failure: Elevated from 0.8 to 1.9 on admission. Now upto
   2.4. Most likely secondary to hepato-renal syndrome, not responding to
   IV fluids.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
    - trend Cr
   - watch UOP -goal 0.5cc/kg/hr
   # COPD: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2045**].
   - maintain O2 sats 88-93%
   - continue albuterol, advair, atrovent, Fluticasone-Salmeterol,
   tiotropium bromide. Increase frequency of nebulizers given wheezing on
   exam today.
   - continue supplemental oxygen -currently on Face tent FiO2 35-50%
   # HTN: currently normotensive - hold antihypertensives during GI bleed
   # ? IBS: followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**] - continue dicyclomine
   # Depression:
   - continue Mirtazapine, Ativan as needed for anxiety
    # Anxiety:
   - hold anxiolytics due to sedating effects in setting of hepatic
   encephalopathy

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis B cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, encephalopathy, and varices, as well as COPD and hypertension. He was admitted for management of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed portal hypertensive gastropathy and possible esophageal varices. The patient has a new diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with no treatment options available.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive gastropathy: The patient's EGD showed esophageal varices and ulcers, which are likely secondary to hypertensive gastropathy. Continued octreotide therapy may be required to reduce portal pressure and prevent further bleeding. If bleeding continues, banding of esophageal varices may be considered.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a mild flap on admission with elevated ammonia levels from oral swallowing. Lactulose therapy should be continued to reduce ammonia levels and monitor the patient's mental status.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.8 to 1.9 on admission and are now up to 2.4. This is most likely secondary to hepato-renal syndrome. Avoidance of nephrotoxins and close monitoring of urine output are recommended. Trending of creatinine levels is also important.

4. Hepatitis B cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is causing portal vein thrombosis without intervention. RUQ US showed a cirrhotic liver with an occluded portal vein, and there were questionable echogenic areas around the portal vein that could represent a mass. An MRI at another hospital confirmed a concern for HCC. Hepatitis B viral load is pending, and treatment options for the cirrhosis should be discussed with the hepatology team.

5. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing wheezing on examination. Nebulizers should be increased in frequency, and supplemental oxygen should be continued to maintain oxygen saturation levels between 88-93%.

6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently normotensive, but antihypertensive medications should be held during GI bleeding. Monitoring of blood pressure is essential.

7. Anxiety and depression: The patient is also being treated for anxiety and depression. Anxiolytics should be used cautiously due to their sedating effects in the setting of hepatic encephalopathy.

8. Foley catheter discomfort: The patient is uncomfortable with the Foley catheter, and consideration should be given to discontinuing it depending on the outcomes of the family meeting.

9. Code status: The patient has deferred making a decision regarding code status to his sister. Full code is not medically indicated given the palliative care approach.

   without intervention per his GI doctor, encephalopathy, and varices,
   COPD, and hypertension, transferred from [**Hospital6 1082**] for
   management of his upper and lower GI bleeding. EGD on [**8-7**] shows portal
   hypertensive gastropathy. Now with new diagnosis of hepatocellular
   carcinoma, no options for treatment. .
   # Hepatocellular carcinoma: No treatment options currently available.
   -palliative care
would like to be discharged to Mother
s home
   -pain control: currently on MS Contin and morphine for breakthrough
   pain.  Will have to titrate this up to better control pain.
   .# Hypertensive gastropathy: EGD showed esophageal varices and ulcers
   most likely secondary to hypertensive gastropathy.   Bleeding is of
   uncertain etiology.  Possibly from esophageal varices.  Per GI, if
   continues to bleed, consider banding.  TIPS and shunt are not
   feasible.  HCT stable for 24 hours>30.
    -continue octreotide gtt
   -qd HCTs - transfuse for HCT < 25
   -PPI 40mg IV bid until tolerating po
   -continue Ceftriaxone 1g qd for SBP primary prophylaxis
    - active T&S and crossmatch 4 units
   - large bore PIVs
   # Hepatitis B Cirrhosis: c/b portal vein thrombosis without
   intervention. RUQ US showed cirrhotic liver, occluded portal vein.
   Questionable echogenic areas around portal vein that could represent
   mass.  Patient had MRI at [**Hospital6 **].  Concern for HCC.  His
   primary GI doctor Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**] is following and will talk to the patient
   today about the diagnosis.
   - trend LFTs, direct bilirubin -elevated LFTs may be from newly
   activated hep B, ischemic liver, or from hepatoma
   - hepatitis B VL pending
   - appreciate hepatology and GI recs: treatment of portal vein
   thrombosis is too risky
   -paracentesis [**8-7**]: not consistent with SBP -consider abdominal port
   for symptom relief
   # Pain control: Per palliative care, started on MS Contin, Reglan, and
   Morphine elixir for breakthrough pain
    # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Has a mild flap on admission with elevated
   ammonia from OSH
    - lactulose 30 mL change to [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor exam
   # Acute Renal Failure: Elevated from 0.8 to 1.9 on admission. Now upto
   2.4. Most likely secondary to hepato-renal syndrome, not responding to
   IV fluids, though could be post renal source given massive ascites.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
    - trend Cr
   -patient was down 1750mL yesterday. Perhaps this was too aggressive.
   -goal fluids today even
   # COPD: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2045**].
   - maintain O2 sats 88-93%
   - continue albuterol, advair, atrovent, Fluticasone-Salmeterol,
   tiotropium bromide. Increase frequency of nebulizers given wheezing on
   exam today.
   - continue supplemental oxygen -currently on Face tent FiO2 35-50%
   # HTN: currently normotensive - hold antihypertensives during GI bleed
   # ? IBS: followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**] - continue dicyclomine
   # Depression:
   - continue Mirtazapine, Ativan as needed for anxiety
    # Anxiety:
   - hold anxiolytics due to sedating effects in setting of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   # FEN: Advance diet to clear liquids / replete lytes prn
   # Access: 3 20 gauge PIVs, 16 gauge PIV, 18 gauge PIV. Rectal tube,
   Foley. Patient uncomfortable with foley.  Will consider discontinuing
   foley depending on outcomes of family meeting. Monitor strict Is/Os.
   # PPx: IV PPI gtt / hold heparin SQ in GI bleed / pneumoboots /
   lactulose
   # Code: FULL currently  -this has been addressed with patient
   yesterday. Not ready to address this currently. Has deferred to his
   sister to make decision regarding code status. Full code not medically
   indicated given palliative care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of COPD, hepatitis B cirrhosis, and recently diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He was admitted for management of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently in the ICU. The patient's urine output is low, and he is not responding to IV fluids. His pain is better controlled on MS Contin 60mg. He requires supplemental oxygen due to COPD. The patient has significant GI losses and massive ascites. His laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels indicating acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepato-renal syndrome or post-renal cause. The patient's liver function tests are also abnormal. He has been started on midodrine and albumin for renal failure but has shown minimal improvement. The patient's family wants him to be discharged to his mother's home, but she is unable to care for him, and the patient may need to go to a nursing home. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is receiving palliative care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): No treatment options are currently available for the patient's HCC, and palliative care will be focused on symptom management.
2. Massive Ascites: The patient has severe distension of the abdomen due to ascites. Therapeutic paracentesis may be considered to relieve the symptoms.
3. Pain: The patient's pain is better controlled with MS"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y .o. M with hepatitis B cirrhosis c/b portal vein thrombosis ,
   encephalopathy, and varices, COPD, and hypertension, transferred from
   [**Hospital6 1082**] for management of his upper and lower GI
   bleeding. EGD on [**8-7**] shows portal hypertensive gastropathy. Now with
   end stage liver disease [**1-19**] HCC, not resectable.
   # Hepatocellular carcinoma: No treatment options currently available.
   -palliative care
would like to be discharged to Mother
s home, but per
   nurse mother states she is unable to care for him and thought he would
   go to Nursing home.  Will meet with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**] today to discuss CMO,
   -pain control: currently on MS Contin and morphine for breakthrough
   pain.  Continues to be uncomfortable but did not want therapeutic
   paracentesis yesterday.  Will ask again today.
   .# Hypertensive gastropathy: EGD showed esophageal varices and ulcers
   most likely secondary to hypertensive gastropathy.   Bleeding is of
   uncertain etiology.  Possibly from esophageal varices.  Per GI, if
   continues to bleed, consider banding.  TIPS and shunt are not
   feasible.  HCT with slight drop today to ??.
    -continue octreotide gtt
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCTs - transfuse for HCT < 25
   -PPI 40mg IV bid until tolerating po
   -continue Ceftriaxone 1g qd for SBP primary prophylaxis
    - active T&S and crossmatch 4 units
   - large bore PIVs
   # Hepatitis B Cirrhosis: c/b portal vein thrombosis without
   intervention. RUQ US showed cirrhotic liver, occluded portal vein.
   Has multpiple stigmata of cirrhosis including palmar erythema, caput
   medusae, telangietasias.
   - trend LFTs, direct bilirubin -elevated LFTs may be from newly
   activated hep B, ischemic liver, or from hepatoma
   - hepatitis B VL pending
   - appreciate hepatology and GI recs: treatment of portal vein
   thrombosis is too risky
   -paracentesis [**8-7**]: not consistent with SBP -consider abdominal port
   for symptom relief
   - Has asterixis today, worsening mental status.  Will monitor neuro
   status
    - lactulose 30ml TID
   # Pain control: Per palliative care, started on MS Contin, Reglan, and
   Morphine elixir for breakthrough pain
   # Acute Renal Failure: Rapidly increasing creatinine (0.4 on admission,
   up to 3.4 last night, ??? this morning).  It appeared that he wasn
   making urine last night, but actually his foley had become
   disconnected. Elevated from 0.8 to 1.9 on admission. Now Most likely
   secondary to hepato-renal syndrome vs. pre-renal vs. compartment
   syndome from ascites.  Albumin given with minimal improvement.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
    - trend Cr
   - continue Midodrine 7.5 TID
   -goal fluids today even
   -consider bladder pressure to eval for compartment syndrome and need
   for paracentesis.
   # COPD: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2045**].
   - maintain O2 sats 88-93%
   - continue albuterol, advair, atrovent, Fluticasone-Salmeterol,
   tiotropium bromide.
   - continue supplemental oxygen -currently on Face tent FiO2 75%
   # HTN: currently normotensive - hold antihypertensives
   # ? IBS: followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**] - continue dicyclomine
   # Depression:
   - continue Mirtazapine, Ativan as needed for anxiety
   # FEN: Advance diet to clear liquids / replete lytes prn
   # Access: 3 20 gauge PIVs, 16 gauge PIV, 18 gauge PIV. Rectal tube,
   Foley. Patient uncomfortable with foley.  Will consider discontinuing
   foley depending CMO status decision today. Monitor strict Is/Os.
   # PPx: IV PPI gtt / hold heparin SQ in GI bleed / pneumoboots /
   lactulose
   # Code: DNR/DNI confirmed with patient
   # Dispo: Palliative care. Eventual discharge home.
   # Comm: with patient; Mother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4530**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4531**] (per pt, his

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis B cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and recently diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient was admitted for management of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been experiencing rapidly increasing creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome or compartment syndrome from ascites. The patient's urine output is low, and his Foley catheter became disconnected last night. He also has signs of encephalopathy, including asterixis, and large ascites. The patient refused therapeutic paracentesis.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/60 to 155/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on a face tent, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, elevated bilirubin levels, and abnormal coagulation profile. His blood glucose levels are within normal limits, but he has an elevated lactate level. Other lab results indicate possible electrolyte imbalances and renal dysfunction.

The patient's medical history includes multiple comorbidities such as HCC, cirrhosis with portal vein thrombosis, esophageal varices, COPD, and hypertension"

   nurse mother states she is unable to care for him and thought he would
   go to Nursing home.  Will meet with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**] today to discuss CMO.
   -pain control: was on MS Contin but now not taking PO.  Continue
   morphine for breakthrough pain.  Continues to be uncomfortable but did
   not want therapeutic paracentesis yesterday.  Will ask again today.
   # Hypertensive gastropathy: EGD showed esophageal varices and ulcers
   most likely secondary to hypertensive gastropathy.   Bleeding is of
   uncertain etiology.  Possibly from esophageal varices.  Per GI, if
   continues to bleed, consider banding.  TIPS and shunt are not
   feasible.  HCT now stable, no sign of bleeding.
    -decrease octreotide gtt
   -daily HCT (which can be stopped if CMO) - transfuse for HCT < 25
   -PPI 40mg IV bid until tolerating po
   -continue Ceftriaxone 1g qd for SBP primary prophylaxis, has increasing
   WBC but no obvious source.  Concern for SBP despite lack of fever and
   diagnostic tap last week without sign of SBP.  Will monitor today and
   consider broadening coverage.
    - active T&S and crossmatch 4 units
   -          large bore PIVs
   # Acute Renal Failure: Rapidly increasing creatinine (0.4 on admission,
   up to 3.4 this morning.  It appeared that he wasn
t making urine last
   night, but actually his foley had become disconnected. Now Most likely
   secondary to hepato-renal syndrome vs. pre-renal vs. compartment
   syndome from ascites.  Albumin given with minimal improvement.
   -attempt therapeutic paracentesis if patient is agreeable.
   - very gentle fluid bolus given concern for extravascular fluid
   accumulation.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend Cr
   - continue Midodrine 7.5 TID
   -consider bladder pressure to eval for compartment syndrome.
   # Hepatitis B Cirrhosis: c/b portal vein thrombosis without
   intervention. RUQ US showed cirrhotic liver, occluded portal vein.
   Has multpiple stigmata of cirrhosis including palmar erythema, caput
   medusae, telangietasias.
   - Increasing LFTs, T. Bili, Hep B viral load is undetetable.  Likely
   [**1-19**] to HCC.
   - appreciate hepatology and GI recs: treatment of portal vein
   thrombosis is too risky
   -          lactulose 30ml TID
   -          worsening encephalopathy, concern for ability to consent for
   CMO.  Monitor neuro status.  Family meeting.
   -
   # Pain control:
   -f/u Per palliative care recs, while taking PO was started on MS
   Contin, Reglan, and Morphine elixir for breakthrough pain.  Now on IV
   morphine.
   # COPD: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2045**].
   - maintain O2 sats 88-93%
   - continue albuterol, advair, atrovent, Fluticasone-Salmeterol,
   tiotropium bromide.
   - continue supplemental oxygen -currently on Face tent FiO2 75%
   # HTN: currently normotensive - hold antihypertensives
   # ? IBS: followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**] - continue dicyclomine
   # Depression:
   - continue Mirtazapine, Ativan as needed for anxiety
   # FEN: Advance diet to clear liquids / replete lytes prn
   # Access: 3 20 gauge PIVs, 16 gauge PIV, 18 gauge PIV. Rectal tube,
   Foley. Patient uncomfortable with foley.  Will consider discontinuing
   foley depending CMO status decision today. Monitor strict Is/Os.
   # PPx: IV PPI gtt / hold heparin SQ in GI bleed / pneumoboots /

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of COPD, HBV cirrhosis, and recently diagnosed HCC. He was admitted for management of upper and lower GI bleeding. The patient has been experiencing clinical worsening over the weekend. He has a rapidly increasing creatinine level, which is concerning for hepatorenal syndrome, pre-renal azotemia, or compartment syndrome due to massive ascites. The patient also has encephalopathy and varices, as well as COPD and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): No treatment options are currently available for the patient's HCC.
2. Massive Ascites: Therapeutic paracentesis may be needed to remove excess fluid from the abdomen.
3. Pain: The patient's pain is not well-controlled, and the current regimen of IV morphine should be continued.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The cause of the patient's acute renal failure is uncertain, but it could be due to pre-renal azotemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or compartment syndrome from ascites. Monitoring of strict intake and output is necessary, and nephrotoxins should be avoided.
5. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: This is likely due to massive ascites, which can impede breathing.
6. Disposition: The patient's disposition will be determined today, with a plan to arrange hospice care and discuss making a care management"

   Assessment and Plan
   Encephalopathy, acute renal failure
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- hepatic and uremic.  Progressive.  Lactulose, may
   require rectal.
   ABDOMINAL PAIN -- likely due to ascites and distention from gas.
   Monitor.  Consider NGT for decompression.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Monitor stool for guiac, daily Hct.
   D/c octreotide.
   PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS --   no plans for intervention or treatment.
   CIRRHOSIS -- progressive liver failure.
   Hepatic INFILTRATIVE PROCESS -- presumed hepatocellular CA.
   DYSPNEA -- hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   COPD -- no active disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are experiencing worsening renal failure, abdominal pain, and increased encephalopathy. The patient has a history of liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and COPD. They are also diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, GI bleed, dyspnea due to hepatopulmonary syndrome, and a DNR/DNI status. The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure, high heart rate, low respiratory rate, and a SpO2 of 93%. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, normal heart rhythm, and clear breath sounds. Lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low albumin levels, high bilirubin, abnormal coagulation profile, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and medication management are being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's worsening encephalopathy suggests the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a brain disorder caused by liver dysfunction. It can lead to altered mental status, confusion, and even coma if left untreated.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Acute renal failure can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis B cirrhosis, complicated by portal vein thrombosis, encephalopathy, and varices. He also has COPD and hypertension. The patient was transferred from another hospital for the management of upper and lower GI bleeding. He underwent an EGD, which showed portal hypertensive gastropathy. The patient has now been diagnosed with end-stage liver disease and worsening renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive gastropathy: The patient has esophageal varices and ulcers most likely secondary to hypertensive gastropathy. There is a possibility of ongoing bleeding from esophageal varices. If the bleeding continues, banding may be considered as a treatment option. 

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have rapidly increased from 0.4 on admission to 3.4 this morning. This could be due to hepato-renal syndrome, pre-renal, or compartment syndrome from ascites. Albumin has been given with minimal improvement. The patient declines therapeutic paracentesis. Avoidance of nephrotoxins is recommended.

3. Hepatitis B Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhotic liver with an occluded portal vein. He exhibits multiple stigmata of cirrhosis including palmar erythema, caput medusae, and telangiectasias. Treatment for portal vein throm"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress, who has been admitted to the ICU. They appear anxious and restless at times, with no known drug allergies. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission, except for some noted changes above. The patient is unable to provide their own history due to encephalopathy.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 91 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 124/76 mmHg to 96/19 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 87% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications and infusions, including morphine sulfate and ceftriaxone.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight and anxious, with pupils that are not dilated, conjunctiva that is not pale, and no signs of scleral edema or icterus. The patient has a normocephalic head, no endotracheal or NG/OG tubes, and normal lymph nodes. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and no murmurs, S3, S4, rub, or signs of peripheral edema. Respiratory examination is clear, with no crackles, wheezes, or diminished breath sounds. Ab"
