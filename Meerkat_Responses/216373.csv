   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   57 yo man with ?NSIP, on prednisone, h/o AF with ablation, CAD, OSA.
   AF ablation done as OSH on [**4-7**], d/ced on [**4-9**] on anticoagulation.  But
   did have some hemoptysis.  Has had worsening dyspnia, and episodes of
   hemoptosis 1 teasoop to 1 tablespoon.  CTA was negative for PE at OSH.
   Transferred to another OSH.  Cared there for few days with increasing
   oxygen requirement.  Continued hemoptysis.  Diuresed and steroid dose
   increased.  Got moxifloxacin yesterday.  ABG: 7.41/37/73 on 10L FM.

   Hypoxemia and hemoptysis:  Significant oxygen requirement.  Unclear
   etiology.  Could be worsening of NSIP.  Recent AFib ablation.  Also
   consider
   pulmonary vein stenosis. Given that he is on anticoagulation, almost
   any pulmonary process can lead to hemoptysis.  Other etologies include
   infectious - PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 5734**].

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), on prednisone, atrial fibrillation (AF) with ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He presented with hypoxemia and hemoptysis. The patient underwent atrial fibrillation ablation as an outpatient surgery on [**4-7**] and was discharged on anticoagulation. However, he experienced some hemoptysis. He has had worsening dyspnea and episodes of hemoptysis ranging from 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE) at the outpatient surgery. The patient was then transferred to another outpatient surgery and cared for a few days with increasing oxygen requirements. He continued to experience hemoptysis. Diuretics and steroid doses were increased, and he received moxifloxacin yesterday. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed pH 7.41, PaCO2 37 mmHg, and PaO2 73 mmHg on 10 liters of oxygen with facial mask.

The patient's allergies are unknown. He has been receiving multiple medications including medrol (80 mg every 8 hours), lisinopril, pronouncer, bactrim, aspirin, calcium carbonate, and hepatic enzymes were checked.

   Assessment and Plan:
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis with high O2
   requirements.
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:
   In patient with multiple potential causes of dyspnea including
   ILD/NSIP, potential cardiac causes (CHF, CAD, Afib s/p recent ablation
   - potential for pulmonary vein stenosis, ?history of PFO - potential
   for shunt), PA HTN; also thought to have component of chronic dyspnea
   unrelated to ILD (significant hyperventilatory response to exercise).
   - Will review/compare imaging with radiology here.
   - CXR now.
   - Check TTE in AM with bubble study if possible
   - Send BNP.
   - Repeat CEs (? positive CEs at OSH)
   - Consider bronch in AM.
   - Continue steroids at increased dose for now.
   - Continue lasix diuresis prn.
   - re: antibiotics
 got moxiflox yesterday, no clear evidence of
   infection (no fever, leukocytosis, focal infiltrate), though is on
   daily prednisone.
   # Hemoptysis:
   On coumadin for Afib with recent ablation. Differential for bleeding
   includes bronchitis, airway trauma from intubation, pneumonia
   (including bacterial, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], or other atypical), neoplasm,
   bronchiectasis, ?pneumonitis exacerbation.
   - CXR now.
   - Review CT and consider repeat of noncontrast chest.
   - Favor bronch in AM, sending for cell count, culture/gram stain, PCP
   stain, AFB.
   - As has been therapeutic around time of ablation, probably at lower
   risk for atrial thrombus - will hold anticoagulation for now (though
   did get PM dose of lovenox and coumadin).  Consider platelet
   transfusion to reverse aspirin induced-plt dysfunction.
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  On anticoagulation.  Now in sinus.
   - Continue sotalol.
   - Hold therapeutic doses of lovenox for now (last got [**4-12**] PM) as well
   as coumadin.
   - continue atenolol.
   # CAD:
   - Continue ASA, statin, BB, ACEI.
   - Enzymes as above.
   # HTN:
   Continue home regimen.
   # DM:
   - Insulin sliding scale with steroid use; may need to add long acting
   standing dose as well.
   - Hold metformin with recent contrast dye; also with creatinine
   slightly above baseline.

- The patient's hemoptysis could be due to bronchitis, airway trauma from intubation, pneumonia (including bacterial, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], or other atypical), neoplasm, bronchiectasis,?pneumonitis exacerbation.
- The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) 37.1 C (98.8 F), current temperature (Tcurrent) 35.8 C (96.5 F), heart rate (HR) 78 bpm (70-82), blood pressure (BP) 102/63 mmHg (72/36-130/82), respiratory rate (RR) 41 breaths per minute (17-48), oxygen saturation (SpO2) 91%, and heart rhythm (HR) in sinus rhythm.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 202 mg/dL, increased troponin-T level of 0.13, and elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
- The patient is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, antibiotics, steroids, lasix diuresis, and others for his underlying conditions.
- The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, and the presence of pulmonary edema on imaging may indicate the development of ARDS.
   - Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia, along with leukocytosis, could suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
   - Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's immobilization and dyspnea could increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient's history of CAD and recent ablation for Afib may increase the risk of acute coronary syndrome.
   - Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and signs of poor perfusion may suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock.
   - Arrhythmias: The patient's history of Afib and recent ablation increases the risk of arrhythmias.

3. Hemostatic Complications:
   - Bleeding: The patient's hemoptysis and the use of anticoagulants (lovenox and coumadin) increase the risk of bleeding.

4. Infectious Complications:
   - Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, and leukocytosis may indicate bacterial pneumonia.
   - Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's dyspnea and hypox"

   Assessment and Plan:
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis with high O2
   requirements.
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:
   Hypoxia relatively stable since admission with patient having 95% high
   flow oxygen requirement. In patient with multiple potential causes of
   dyspnea including ILD/NSIP, potential cardiac causes (CHF, CAD, Afib
   s/p recent ablation - potential for pulmonary vein stenosis, ?history
   of PFO - potential for shunt), PA HTN; also thought to have component
   of chronic dyspnea unrelated to ILD (significant hyperventilatory
   response to exercise). Outside hospital cardiac CT was reviewed here
   and no obvious evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis. Transthoracic
   echocardiography was of poor quality due to body habitus and a PFO or
   ASD could not be conclusively ruled out. Patient ruled out for ACS with
   flat troponins. BNP was within normal limits at 288. As cause of
   hypoxia still unknown, will obtain further imaging. Patient
s likely
   status likely too tenuous for him to be subjected to bronchoscopy,
   which would provide limited additional information.
   - Continue methylprednisilone 80 mg every 8 hours
   - Continue lasix diuresis
   - High resolution chest CT later today
   - Liberate from supplemental oxygen
   # Hemoptysis:
   On coumadin for Afib with recent ablation. Differential for bleeding
   includes bronchitis, airway trauma from intubation, pneumonia
   (including bacterial, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], or other atypical), neoplasm,
   bronchiectasis, interstitial pneumonia exacerbation. Hemoptysis has
   been improving since admission; HCT has dropped to 25.8.
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - High resolution chest CT later today
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  On anticoagulation.  Now in sinus.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold therapeutic doses of lovenox for now (last got [**4-12**] PM) as well
   as coumadin.
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI.
   - Continue ASA, statin
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to periodic hypotension
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to periodic hypotension

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) after ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient is currently on high-flow oxygen, and his oxygen saturation is 91%. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/63 mmHg to 130/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 41 breaths per minute, and a pulse oximetry level of 91%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient's dyspnea and hypoxia can be attributed to multiple potential causes including ILD/NSIP, cardiac causes (CHF, CAD, Afib s/p recent ablation), pulmonary artery hypertension (PA HTN), and chronic dyspnea unrelated to ILD. Further imaging is needed to identify the underlying cause.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient has a history of hemoptysis, which could be due to bronchitis, airway trauma from intubation, pneumonia (bacterial, PCP, or atypical), neoplasm, bronchiectasis, or interstitial pneumonia exacerbation. A high-resolution chest CT is planned to investigate further.

   Assessment and Plan:
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis with high O2
   requirements.
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:
   Hypoxia relatively stable since admission with patient having 95% high
   flow oxygen requirement. In patient with multiple potential causes of
   dyspnea including ILD/NSIP, potential cardiac causes (CHF, CAD, Afib
   s/p recent ablation - potential for pulmonary vein stenosis, ?history
   of PFO - potential for shunt), PA HTN; also thought to have component
   of chronic dyspnea unrelated to ILD (significant hyperventilatory
   response to exercise). Outside hospital cardiac CT was reviewed here
   and no obvious evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis. Transthoracic
   echocardiography was of poor quality due to body habitus and a PFO or
   ASD could not be conclusively ruled out. Patient ruled out for ACS with
   flat troponins. BNP was within normal limits at 288. As cause of
   hypoxia still unknown, will obtain further imaging. Patient
s likely
   status likely too tenuous for him to be subjected to bronchoscopy,
   which would provide limited additional information.
   - Continue methylprednisilone 80 mg every 8 hours
   - Continue lasix diuresis
   - High resolution chest CT later today
   - Liberate from supplemental oxygen
   # Hemoptysis:
   On coumadin for Afib with recent ablation. Differential for bleeding
   includes bronchitis, airway trauma from intubation, pneumonia
   (including bacterial, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], or other atypical), neoplasm,
   bronchiectasis, interstitial pneumonia exacerbation. Hemoptysis has
   been improving since admission; HCT has dropped to 25.8.
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - High resolution chest CT later today
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  On anticoagulation.  Now in sinus.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold therapeutic doses of lovenox for now (last got [**4-12**] PM) as well
   as coumadin.
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI.
   - Continue ASA, statin
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to periodic hypotension
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to periodic hypotension

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) on prednisone, atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital due to dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis with high oxygen requirements. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 119/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on BiPAP. He is in sinus rhythm with a regular heartbeat. 

On the flow sheet, the patient has received various medications including CPAP overnight due to frequent oxygen desaturations, adjustments to his Humalog insulin sliding scale, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

The physical examination shows scattered crackles in the lungs, no wheezes, and the patient is alert and oriented. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Other lab values, including electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, are within normal limits. 

The assessment and plan include continuing methylprednisolone and lasix diuresis, obtaining a high-resolution chest CT later that day, and liberating the patient from supplemental oxygen. The patient's hemoptysis has been improving since admission, and his hem"

   Assessment and Plan:
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis with high O2
   requirements.
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:
   Hypoxia relatively stable since admission with patient having 95% high
   flow oxygen requirement. In patient with multiple potential causes of
   dyspnea including ILD/NSIP, potential cardiac causes (CHF, CAD, Afib
   s/p recent ablation - potential for pulmonary vein stenosis, ?history
   of PFO - potential for shunt), PA HTN; also thought to have component
   of chronic dyspnea unrelated to ILD (significant hyperventilatory
   response to exercise). Outside hospital cardiac CT was reviewed here
   and no obvious evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis. Transthoracic
   echocardiography was of poor quality due to body habitus and a PFO or
   ASD could not be conclusively ruled out. Will likely obtain cardiology
   consult to assist in ruling out sequelae of recen AFIB ablation as
   cause of current presentation given temporal relationship. Patient
   ruled out for ACS with flat troponins. BNP was within normal limits at
   288. High res CT chest obtained yesterday revealed marked increase in
   bilateral ground glass opacities. Unknown cause for these opacities.
   Patient
s likely status likely too tenuous for him to be subjected to
   bronchoscopy without need for intubation prior.
   - Continue methylprednisilone 80 mg every 8 hours
   - Continue lasix diuresis
   - Cardiology consult
   - Liberate from supplemental oxygen as able
   # Hemoptysis:
   On coumadin at presentation indicated for Afib with recent ablation.
   Differential for bleeding includes bronchitis, airway trauma from
   intubation, pneumonia (including bacterial, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], or other
   atypical), neoplasm, pulmonary vein stenosis, bronchiectasis,
   interstitial pneumonia exacerbation. Hemoptysis has been improving
   since admission; HCT stable at 28.0 without intervention.
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Holding anticoagulation.  Now in sinus.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) who presented with hypoxemia and hemoptysis following an atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. His condition worsened overnight, leading to increased hypoxemia and hemoptysis. He was started on non-invasive ventilation. The patient has several medical conditions, including hypertension, AFib, diastolic heart failure, and ICU care. His vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure, high respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. He is receiving multiple medications, including heparin for prophylaxis, steroids, statins, and others. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, troponin T levels, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), along with abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's condition is critical, and there are concerns about potential complications such as pulmonary embolism or primary lung process related to his underlying lung disease. Intubation and further diagnostic procedures may be necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of AF ablation and worsening hemoptysis raises the possibility of a clot reappearing in the pulmonary vein, leading to a pulmonary embolism.
2. Primary lung process: The patient's underlying lung disease (ILD) could be worsening, causing diffuse lung infiltrates and respiratory failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is below the"

   requirements.
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:
   Hypoxia relatively stable since admission with patient having 95% high
   flow oxygen requirement. In patient with multiple potential causes of
   dyspnea including ILD/NSIP, potential cardiac causes (CHF, CAD, Afib
   s/p recent ablation - potential for pulmonary vein stenosis, ?history
   of PFO - potential for shunt), PA HTN; also thought to have component
   of chronic dyspnea unrelated to ILD (significant hyperventilatory
   response to exercise). Outside hospital cardiac CT was reviewed here
   and no obvious evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis. Transthoracic
   echocardiography was of poor quality due to body habitus and a PFO or
   ASD could not be conclusively ruled out. Will likely obtain cardiology
   consult to assist in ruling out sequelae of recen AFIB ablation as
   cause of current presentation given temporal relationship. Patient
   ruled out for ACS with flat troponins. BNP was within normal limits at
   288. High res CT chest obtained yesterday revealed marked increase in
   bilateral ground glass opacities. Unknown cause for these opacities.
   Patient
s likely status likely too tenuous for him to be subjected to
   bronchoscopy without need for intubation prior.
   - Continue methylprednisilone 80 mg every 8 hours

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) that has undergone recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient experienced an acute change in respiratory status yesterday evening, leading to emergent intubation. Despite being on mechanical ventilation, the patient had difficulty with oxygenation, which improved when placed on airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode. The patient's oxygen saturation levels are now in the upper 90s. The cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis remains unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team is implementing a vent bundle to prevent this complication.
2. Bleeding: The patient is on Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation and recent ablation, which increases the risk of bleeding. Hemoptysis has improved since admission, but the healthcare team needs to monitor the patient's hematocrit levels and maintain a type and screen for possible transfusion if the hematocrit drops below 21.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic he"

   Assessment and Plan:
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis with high O2
   requirements.
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:
   Hypoxia relatively stable since admission with patient having 95% high
   flow oxygen requirement. In patient with multiple potential causes of
   dyspnea including ILD/NSIP, potential cardiac causes (CHF, CAD, Afib
   s/p recent ablation - potential for pulmonary vein stenosis, ?history
   of PFO - potential for shunt), PA HTN; also thought to have component
   of chronic dyspnea unrelated to ILD (significant hyperventilatory
   response to exercise). Outside hospital cardiac CT was reviewed here
   and no obvious evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis. Transthoracic
   echocardiography was of poor quality due to body habitus and a PFO or
   ASD could not be conclusively ruled out. Will likely obtain cardiology
   consult to assist in ruling out sequelae of recen AFIB ablation as
   cause of current presentation given temporal relationship. Patient
   ruled out for ACS with flat troponins. BNP was within normal limits at
   288. High res CT chest obtained yesterday revealed marked increase in
   bilateral ground glass opacities. Unknown cause for these opacities.
   Patient
s likely status likely too tenuous for him to be subjected to
   bronchoscopy without need for intubation prior.
   - Continue methylprednisilone 80 mg every 8 hours
   - Continue lasix diuresis
   - Cardiology consult
   - Liberate from supplemental oxygen as able
   # Hemoptysis:
   On coumadin at presentation indicated for Afib with recent ablation.
   Differential for bleeding includes bronchitis, airway trauma from
   intubation, pneumonia (including bacterial, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], or other
   atypical), neoplasm, pulmonary vein stenosis, bronchiectasis,
   interstitial pneumonia exacerbation. Hemoptysis has been improving
   since admission; HCT stable at 28.0 without intervention.
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Holding anticoagulation.  Now in sinus.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI.
   - Continue ASA, statin

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (AFib) post-ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient requires high levels of supplemental oxygen. He has been intubated and placed on airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode. The patient has been sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. Central venous access has been obtained through the right internal jugular vein.

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Barotrauma or bronchial rupture due to high airway pressures during APRV
- Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
- Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances or medication effects
- Pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheterization
- Myocardial infarction (MI) due to coronary artery disease

3. Hemodynamic Complications:
- Hypotension due to sepsis, medication effects, or fluid shifts
- Hypertension due to stress response, pain, or medication effects

4. Infection-related Complications:
- Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to prolonged intubation and immun"

   Reviewed TEE results which showed no pulmonary vein stenosis and no [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**].   Given the BAL showed bloody return and he has been peep
   responsive on the vent, this is less likely AIP and more likely an

   treat with pulse dose steroids 1gm/day for three days.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure. He experienced worsening desaturation and tachypnea overnight and was subsequently intubated. The patient was placed on Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) with improvement in oxygenation.

The patient has been receiving various medications including sedatives, analgesics, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. His allergies are unknown. He has a history of multiple comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and other medical conditions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/62 mmHg to 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and unresponsive with no motor activity.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. His electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver function tests, and cardiac markers are within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient continues to be hypoxemic despite being on mechanical ventilation. The attending physician suspects alveolar hemorrhage syndrome rather than acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP). A transesophageal ech"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and interstitial lung disease. He was admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient experienced episodes of agitation and thrashing, requiring additional sedation. His respiratory rate was increased, and he required high-flow oxygen. A transesophageal echo and bronchoscopy were performed, revealing no significant findings. The patient's urine and BAL fluid cultures are pending. The patient has been receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation. He has also been receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Vital signs show a slightly elevated body temperature, stable heart rate, and blood pressure within normal ranges. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and he is maintaining adequate oxygenation. His blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis. The patient has a large circumference neck with scattered fine crackles and breath sounds largely obscured by ventilator sounds. Physical examination findings are otherwise unremarkable.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal ranges.

The patient remains intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory support. His condition remains stable, and he is being closely monitored."

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis with high O2
   requirements.
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:
   Patient had acute change in respiratory status yesterday evening when
   he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea leading to an emergent
   intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with standard vent modes led to
   patient being placed on APRV mode, with good response in oxygenation.
   Now stable with oxygen sats in the upper 90s. Still with unknown cause
   of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in
   ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and
   hypoxia following a-fib ablation.
   - ABGs today with vent changes to assess for ventilatory status
   - TEE today to further look at cardiac etiology of hypoxia and ground
   glass opacities on CT chest
   - Sputum sample from endotracheal tube
   - If able to further liberate from supplemental oxygen, consider bronch
   - Continue methylprednisilone 80 mg every 8 hours
   - Discontinue lasix diuresis
   - Liberate from vent as possible
   # Hemoptysis:
   On coumadin at presentation indicated for Afib with recent ablation.
   Differential for bleeding includes bronchitis, airway trauma from
   intubation, pneumonia (including bacterial, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], or other
   atypical), neoplasm, pulmonary vein stenosis, bronchiectasis,
   interstitial pneumonia exacerbation. Hemoptysis has been improving
   since admission; HCT has been variable, at 25.3 today.
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Discontinued aspirin
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Holding anticoagulation.  Now in sinus.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin during period of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to periodic hypotension
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to periodic hypotension

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient had an acute change in respiratory status yesterday evening, leading to emergent intubation. He was placed on APRV mode, which showed a good response in oxygenation. The patient's oxygen saturation is now in the upper 90s, but the cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis remains unknown. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress and hypoxia: The patient had difficulty with oxygenation on standard vent modes, necessitating a switch to APRV mode. This indicates severe respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient presented with hemoptysis, which could be due to various causes such as bronchitis, airway trauma from intubation, pneumonia (bacterial, PCP, other atypical), neoplasm, pulmonary vein stenosis, bronchiectasis, or interstitial pneumonia exacerbation. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient had recent ablation for atrial fibrillation (Afib) and is currently in sinus rhythm. Holding anticoagulation is appropriate, but close monitoring is required.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) that underwent recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was admitted with symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. 

The patient had an acute change in respiratory status on the evening of [4-15] with progressive hypoxia and tachypnea leading to emergent intubation. Despite being on high levels of oxygen, the patient's oxygenation remained difficult. The patient was placed on Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) mode, which showed a good response in oxygenation. 

A transesophageal echo (TEE) was performed, ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as a cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fibrillation ablation. A bronchoscopy conducted yesterday revealed alveolar hemorrhage, which could signify some vasculitis. High-dose steroids were started due to this finding. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 125/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis with high O2
   requirements.
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:
   Patient had acute change in respiratory status on evening of [**4-15**] when
   he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea leading to an emergent
   intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with standard vent modes led to
   patient being placed on APRV mode, with good response in oxygenation.
   Now stable with oxygen sats in the upper 90s. Still with unknown cause
   of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in
   ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and
   hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary
   vein stenosis. Bronch yesterday showed alveolar hemorrhage which could
   signify some vasculitis so high dose steroids was started.
   - ABGs today with vent changes to assess for ventilatory status, plan
   to switch to regular settings CMV vs PSV
   - f/u sputum sample from endotracheal tube
   - Continue methylprednisilone 1000 mg every 24 hours x3 days (though
   Sat) then switch to 60mg prednisone
   - Liberate from vent as possible
   - maintain even to slightly negative I/O
   - check ESR, [**Doctor First Name **]
   # Hemoptysis:
   On coumadin at presentation indicated for Afib with recent ablation.
   Differential for bleeding includes bronchitis, airway trauma from
   intubation, pneumonia (including bacterial, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], or other
   atypical), neoplasm, pulmonary vein stenosis, bronchiectasis,
   interstitial pneumonia exacerbation. Hemoptysis has been improving
   since admission; HCT has been variable, at 25.9 today.
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Discontinued aspirin
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Holding anticoagulation.  Now in sinus.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin during period of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to periodic hypotension
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to periodic hypotension
   # DM: glucose has gone up with the steroid on top of diabetes:
   - insulin drip for now then after steroids are weaned can return to
   insulin sliding scale with glargine
   - Hold metformin

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) on prednisone, atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. He had an acute change in respiratory status on the evening of [4-15] with progressive hypoxia and tachypnea leading to emergent intubation. There has been difficulty with oxygenation using standard vent modes, so the patient was placed on Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) mode, which showed a good response in oxygenation. The patient is currently stable with oxygen saturation levels in the upper 90s.

The cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis remains unknown. A cardiology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as the cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fibrillation ablation. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. A bronchoscopic examination yesterday showed alveolar hemorrhage, which could signify some vasculitis. Therefore, high-dose steroids were started.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 149/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure and hemoptysis. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, and interstitial lung disease. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/60 mmHg to 149/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 17 mmHg and fluid balance within normal limits. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early identification of any signs of infection are crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT formation, which can potentially lead to a PE. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be continued to prevent clot formation.
3. Nosocomial infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay"

   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode, with good
   response in oxygenation. Patient switched to CMV on [**4-17**] with PEEP at
   18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Now stable with oxygen sats in the
   upper 90s. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall.
   Caridology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as
   cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation.
   TEE was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was
   consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for
   vasculitis, pulse dose steroids were initiated. CRP was elevated at 24.
   Hemoptysis has been improving since admission; HCT has been stable at
   26 in last two days. BAL without positive culture data at this time.
   Viral screen could not be run due to insufficient sample.
   - Continue methylprednisilone 1000 mg today and then switch to 60mg
   prednisone tomorrow
   - Liberate from vent as possible
   - Maintain even to slightly negative I/O
   - Follow-up [**Doctor First Name **]
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Redraw viral respiratory screen
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to periodic hypotension
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   - Hold home atenolol, lisinopril, tamsulosin due to periodic
   hypotension
   # DM:
   Glucose has gone up with the steroid on top of diabetes.
   - Insulin drip for now then after steroids are weaned can return to
   insulin sliding scale with glargine
   - Hold metformin

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient had an acute change in respiratory status on the evening of [4-15] and required emergent intubation. Despite oxygenation difficulties with standard ventilator modes, the patient responded well to an airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode. He was later switched to a controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode with a PEEP of 18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Currently, the patient's oxygen saturation levels are in the upper 90s. However, the cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis remains unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The bronchoscopy results were consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. This condition can lead to respiratory failure due to impaired gas exchange caused by bleeding into the alveoli.
2. Vasculitis: The concern for vasculitis prompted the initiation of pulse-dose steroids. Vasculitis can cause systemic inflammation and damage blood vessels, leading to organ dysfunction.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to mechanical ventilation"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical complications. The patient's chief complaints are hypoxemic respiratory failure and hemoptysis. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) yesterday and pulse dose steroids were started due to concerns for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/60 mmHg to 149/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 158.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are overweight/obese, with normocephalic head, endotracheal tube in place, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds anteriorly, soft non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and no neurological assessment due to sedation and intubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode, with good
   response in oxygenation. Patient switched to CMV on [**4-17**] with PEEP at
   18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Now stable with oxygen sats in the
   upper 90s. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall.
   Caridology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as
   cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation.
   TEE was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was
   consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for
   vasculitis, pulse dose steroids were initiated. CRP was elevated at 24.
   Hemoptysis has been improving since admission; HCT has been stable at
   26 in last two days. BAL without positive culture data at this time.
   Viral screen could not be run due to insufficient sample.
   - Continue methylprednisilone 1000 mg today and then switch to 60mg
   prednisone tomorrow
   - Liberate from vent as possible
   - Maintain even to slightly negative I/O
   - Follow-up [**Doctor First Name **]
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Redraw viral respiratory screen
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to periodic hypotension
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   - Hold home atenolol, lisinopril, tamsulosin due to periodic
   hypotension
   # DM:
   Glucose has gone up with the steroid on top of diabetes.
   - Insulin drip for now then after steroids are weaned can return to
   insulin sliding scale with glargine
   - Hold metformin

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient underwent emergent intubation due to progressive hypoxia and tachypnea. Despite difficulty with oxygenation using standard ventilation modes, the patient responded well to airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode. He was later switched to controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with a PEEP of 18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Currently, the patient's oxygen saturation is in the upper 90s and stable.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure and hemoptysis, likely inter-related processes. The cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis remains unknown. A cardiology consult helped rule out pulmonary vein stenosis as a cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] showed findings consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids were initiated. CRP was elevated at 24, but the patient's hemoptysis has been improving since admission"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode, with good
   response in oxygenation. Patient switched to CMV on [**4-17**] with PEEP at
   18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Now stable with oxygen sats in the
   upper 90s. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall.
   Caridology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as
   cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation.
   TEE was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was
   consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for
   vasculitis, pulse dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24
   hours) were initiated on [**4-16**]. CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has
   been improving since admission; HCT has been stable at 26 in last three
   days. BAL without positive culture data at this time. Viral screen from
   BALcould not be run due to insufficient sample.
   - Begin tapering steroids with 60mg prednisone tomorrow
   - Liberate from vent as possible starting with decreased PEEP
   - Maintain even to slightly negative I/O
   - Follow-up [**Doctor First Name **]
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Redraw viral respiratory screen
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   This AM has SBP up to 150s. Holding home atenolol, lisinopril,
   tamsulosin due to hypotension at admission.
   - Think about starting lisinopril today if pressures remain elevated to
   150s systolic
   # DM:
   Glucose has gone up with the steroid on top of diabetes.
   - Insulin drip for now then after steroids are weaned can return to
   insulin sliding scale with glargine
   - Hold metformin

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient underwent emergent intubation due to progressive respiratory status. He has been difficult to oxygenate on standard ventilator modes but responded well to airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode. He was switched to controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with a PEEP of 18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. His oxygen saturation has been in the upper 90s and stable.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/hemoptysis: The patient's acute change in respiratory status on [4-15] led to an emergent intubation. He was placed on APRV mode with good response in oxygenation. He was switched to CMV on [4-17] with PEEP at 18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Now stable with oxygen sats in the upper 90s. Difficult to determine the cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall. Cardiology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as the cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypoxemic respiratory failure, hemoptysis, and other medical conditions. They are sedated and intubated, unable to provide a history. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including infusions of fentanyl, insulin, and midazolam. They are on prophylactic heparin and a proton pump inhibitor. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/67 mmHg to 149/76 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has symmetric chest expansion and clear breath sounds. Neurologically, the patient is sedated and not attentive or responsive. Laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate. However, there are elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and troponin-T. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 240, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 27 mEq/L. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to alveolar hemorrhage syndrome, and has been given pulse dose steroids and a pressure support ventilation trial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and interstitial lung disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and is now showing signs of respiratory distress with increased oxygen requirements. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening respiratory status and persistent fever despite antibiotic administration.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Delirium: The patient's sedation status needs to be closely monitored, as delirium can occur in critically ill patients.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots.
4. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk for developing stress ulcers due to the inflammatory response and increased gastric acid secretion.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive intake-output balance, indicating a potential risk for fluid overload.
6. Hypoglycemia: Insulin therapy may lead to hypoglycemia if not closely monitored.
7. Medication errors: With multiple medications and infusions, there"

   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode, with good
   response in oxygenation. Patient switched to CMV on [**4-17**] with PEEP at
   18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Now stable with oxygen sats in the
   upper 90s. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall.
   Caridology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as
   cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation.
   TEE was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was
   consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for
   vasculitis, pulse dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24
   hours) were initiated on [**4-16**]. CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has
   been improving since admission; HCT has been stable at 25-26. BAL
   without positive culture data at this time. Viral screen from BAL could
   not be run due to insufficient sample.
   - Steroids 60mg prednisone q day
   - Wean from vent as possible starting with decreased PEEP
   - Maintain even to slightly negative I/O
   - Follow-up [**Doctor First Name **]
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Redraw viral respiratory screen
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Spiked to 102.2 overnight. Pancultured.
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue to monitor temps
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Last 24 hours BPs 130s-150s systolic. Holding home atenolol,
   lisinopril, tamsulosin due to hypotension at admission.
   - Will consider starting lisinopril today if pressures remain elevated
   to 150s systolic
   # DM: Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids.
   - Insulin drip for now then after steroids are weaned can return to
   insulin sliding scale with glargine
   - Hold metformin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. Upon admission, the patient had an acute change in respiratory status, leading to emergent intubation. Oxygenation difficulties prompted the use of an airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode, which was effective. The patient was later switched to a conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode with PEEP at 18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Currently, the patient is stable with oxygen saturation in the upper 90s.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/hemoptysis: The patient's hypoxia and hemoptysis remain unexplained despite various interventions. A bronchoscopy revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Pulse dose steroids were initiated due to concern for vasculitis. CRP was elevated at 24, and hemoptysis has been improving since admission. BAL culture data is pending, and a viral screen from BAL could not be performed due to insufficient sample.
2. Fever: The patient's temperature spiked to 102.2 degrees overnight. Cultures have been obtained, and the patient will be monitored for further temperature changes.
3. Afib: The patient underwent recent ablation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) that underwent recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was transferred from another hospital with symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. 

The patient experienced an acute change in respiratory status on the evening of [4-15] with progressive hypoxia and tachypnea leading to emergent intubation. Oxygenation difficulties with standard vent modes led to the patient being placed on Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) mode, which showed a good response in oxygenation. The patient was later switched to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) with PEEP at 18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Currently, the patient is stable with oxygen saturation levels in the upper 90s.

A cardiology consult ruled out pulmonary vein stenosis as the cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fibrillation ablation. Transthoracic echocardiography (TEE) was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [4-16] showed findings consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [4-16]. CRP was"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode, with good
   response in oxygenation. Patient switched to CMV on [**4-17**] with PEEP at
   18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Now stable with oxygen sats in the
   upper 90s. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall.
   Caridology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as
   cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation.
   TEE was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was
   consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for
   vasculitis, pulse dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24
   hours) were initiated on [**4-16**]. CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has
   been improving since admission; HCT has been stable at 26 in last three
   days. BAL without positive culture data at this time. Viral screen from
   BALcould not be run due to insufficient sample.
   - Begin tapering steroids with 60mg prednisone tomorrow
   - Liberate from vent as possible starting with decreased PEEP
   - Maintain even to slightly negative I/O
   - Follow-up [**Doctor First Name **]
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Redraw viral respiratory screen
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   This AM has SBP up to 150s. Holding home atenolol, lisinopril,
   tamsulosin due to hypotension at admission.
   - Think about starting lisinopril today if pressures remain elevated to
   150s systolic
   # DM:
   Glucose has gone up with the steroid on top of diabetes.
   - Insulin drip for now then after steroids are weaned can return to
   insulin sliding scale with glargine
   - Hold metformin

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode, with good
   response in oxygenation. Patient switched to CMV on [**4-17**] with PEEP at
   18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Now stable with oxygen sats in the
   upper 90s. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall.
   Caridology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as
   cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation.
   TEE was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was
   consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for
   vasculitis, pulse dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24
   hours) were initiated on [**4-16**]. CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has
   been improving since admission; HCT has been stable at 25-26. BAL
   without positive culture data at this time. Viral screen from BAL could
   not be run due to insufficient sample.
   - Steroids 60mg prednisone q day
   - Wean from vent as possible starting with decreased PEEP
   - Maintain even to slightly negative I/O
   - Follow-up [**Doctor First Name **]
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Redraw viral respiratory screen
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Spiked to 102.2 overnight. Pancultured.
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue to monitor temps
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Last 24 hours BPs 130s-150s systolic. Holding home atenolol,
   lisinopril, tamsulosin due to hypotension at admission.
   - Will consider starting lisinopril today if pressures remain elevated
   to 150s systolic
   # DM: Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids.
   - Insulin drip for now then after steroids are weaned can return to
   insulin sliding scale with glargine
   - Hold metformin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) that underwent recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was transferred from another hospital due to dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. 

The patient had an acute change in respiratory status on the evening of [4-15] with progressive hypoxia and tachypnea leading to emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation on standard vent modes led to the patient being placed on Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) mode, which showed a good response in oxygenation. The patient was then switched to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) on [4-17] with PEEP at 18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Currently, the patient is stable with oxygen saturation levels in the upper 90s. However, the cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis remains unknown.

A cardiology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as a cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fibrillation ablation. Transthoracic echocardiography (TEE) was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [4-16] showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse-dose steroids (methylprednisol"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a history of bilateral infiltrates with bloody return on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), potentially consistent with alveolar hemorrhage syndrome. Pulse dose steroids have been initiated, and a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) has been attempted.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is being treated with sotalol to manage AFib. It is important to continue this treatment as AFib can increase the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events.

3. Hemoptysis: Although the patient has less hemoptysis noted on suctioning, it is still present and appears old with minimal quantity. Further evaluation is needed to determine if this is due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) or other causes.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable, indicating no significant anemia at this time. However, ongoing blood loss or other causes of anemia should be monitored.

5. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): The patient has evidence of obstructive process in play, and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is the current leading diagnosis. A lung biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

6. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient requires an"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode, with good
   response in oxygenation. Patient switched to CMV on [**4-17**] with PEEP at
   18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Now stable with oxygen sats in the
   upper 90s. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall.
   Caridology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as
   cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation.
   TEE was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was
   consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for
   vasculitis, pulse dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24
   hours) were initiated on [**4-16**]. CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has
   been improving since admission; HCT has been stable at 25-26. BAL
   without positive culture data at this time. Viral screen from BAL could
   not be run due to insufficient sample.
   - Steroids 60mg prednisone q day
   - Wean from vent as possible starting with decreased PEEP
   - Maintain even to slightly negative I/O
   - Follow-up [**Doctor First Name **]
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Redraw viral respiratory screen
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Spiked to 102.2 overnight. Pancultured.
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue to monitor temps
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Last 24 hours BPs 130s-150s systolic. Holding home atenolol,
   lisinopril, tamsulosin due to hypotension at admission.
   - Will consider starting lisinopril today if pressures remain elevated
   to 150s systolic
   # DM: Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids.
   - Insulin drip for now then after steroids are weaned can return to
   insulin sliding scale with glargine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) on prednisone, atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. 

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient likely has hypoxemic respiratory failure and hemoptysis. The cause of these symptoms is still unknown. The patient underwent an emergency intubation due to progressive hypoxia and tachypnea. Oxygenation difficulties led to the use of an airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode, which showed a good response. The patient was then switched to continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) with PEEP at 18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Currently, the patient is stable with oxygen saturation in the upper 90s.

A cardiology consult ruled out pulmonary vein stenosis as the cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. A bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] showed findings consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode, with good
   response in oxygenation. Patient switched to CMV on [**4-17**] with PEEP at
   18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Now stable with oxygen sats in the
   upper 90s. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall.
   Caridology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as
   cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation.
   TEE was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was
   consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for
   vasculitis, pulse dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24
   hours) were initiated on [**4-16**]. CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has
   been improving since admission; HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**]
   sputum with organisms on gram stain; however, no culture data at this
   time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM are negative; however, with elevated CRP
   and encouraging response to steroids with improving vent setting and
   CXR, vasculitis is not ruled-out. Respiratory viral screen is negative.
    Having issues with sedation and periodic agitation requiring boluses
   of midaz and fent.
   - Standing and PRN haldol to help manage sedation.
   - Check EKG this afternoon to monitor QTc.
   - Continue 60mg prednisone daily
   - Attempt to liberate from high PEEP today
   - Maintain even to slightly negative I/O
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 24 hours; however, temp has been in low 100s.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Last 24 hours BPs 130s-150s systolic when patient comfortable with
   paroxysms of BP to 200s systolic with agitation. We were holding home
   atenolol, lisinopril, tamsulosin due to hypotension at admission.
   - Restart home lisinopril dosing
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids.
   - Insulin drip for now then after steroids are weaned can return to
   insulin sliding scale with glargine
   - Hold metformin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) on prednisone, atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was transferred from another hospital with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. Upon admission, the patient had an acute change in respiratory status, leading to emergent intubation. Oxygenation difficulties with standard ventilator modes resulted in the patient being placed on APRV mode, with good response. The patient was later switched to CMV mode with PEEP at 18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. The patient's oxygen saturation levels are currently in the upper 90s.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary issues include hypoxemic respiratory failure and hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concerns about vasculitis, pulse-dose steroids were initiated. CRP levels are elevated, but ANCA, [Doctor's First Name], and anti-GBM tests are negative. However, with elevated CRP and an encouraging response to steroids, vasculitis cannot be ruled out. A respiratory viral screen came back negative.

Other medical conditions being managed include fever, atrial fibrillation post recent ablation, coronary artery disease, hypertension/hypotension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient's sedation is an issue, requiring periodic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) who is currently experiencing respiratory failure. He underwent atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and developed pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient has been tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 129/74 mmHg to 156/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, with fluid balance indicating an input of 3,579 mL and output of 1,840 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, tidal volume (Vt) of 1,177 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 293. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 50 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 117 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 27 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -5 mEq/L, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 8.5 L/min.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with a systolic murmur. The respiratory system is clear bilaterally. Neurologically, the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds to stimulation, and has normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.8 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 143 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 4.8 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 108 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 27 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) level of 7.9 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level of 2.5 mg/dL, phosphate (PO4) level of 3.6 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 25.6 mg/dL.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is hypoxia. The patient has been restarted on home lisinopril and attempted ventilator liberation by dropping FiO2 from 50% to 40% and decreasing PEEP from 14 to 10. The first ABG showed pH 7.40, PaCO2 54 mmHg, and PaO2 92 mmHg. After several hours of reduced vent settings, the second ABG showed pH 7.43, PaCO2 51 mmHg, and PaO2 65 mmHg. Due to low pO2, FiO2 was increased back to 50%. The patient continues to require bolus sedation with fentanyl and midazolam, also received haloperidol 2 mg several times. FiO2 decreased back to 40%.

The review of systems is unable to be performed due to sedation. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was Bactrim (SMX/TMP) on [**2111-4-20**] at 09:16 AM. Infusions include fentanyl at 150 mcg/hour and midazolam (Versed) at 7 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include lansoprazole (Prevacid) on [**2111-4-21**] at 09:00 AM, heparin sodium (prophylaxis) on [**2111-4-22**] at 12:02 AM, midazolam (Versed) on [**2111-4-22**] at 05:10 AM, haloperidol (Haldol) on [**2111-4-22**] at 05:27 AM, and fentanyl on [**2111-4-22**] at 06:34 AM.

The flowsheet data as of [**2111-4-22**] 07:38 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings. The patient's temperature is 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate is 102 bpm with a sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranges from 154/80 mmHg to 105/55 mmHg, respiratory rate is 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on FiO2 50%. The patient's central venous pressure is 12 mmHg, total input is 3,640 mL, and total output is 1,705 mL.

The patient's arterial blood gas results show pH 7.44, PaCO2 43 mmHg, and PaO2 86 mmHg. The respiratory system is supported with an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission;
   HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram
   stain; however, no culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM
   are negative; however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to
   steroids with improving vent setting and CXR, vasculitis is not
   ruled-out and is furthermore the leading diagnosis at this time.
   Respiratory viral screen is negative.  Having issues with sedation and
   periodic agitation requiring boluses of midaz and fent. Currently
   tolerating pressure support ventilation with 8 over 12 and FiO2 of 50%.
   - Standing and PRN haldol (single dose up to 5 mg) to help manage
   sedation.
   - Use telemetry to monitor QTc.
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis
   - Liberate PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 24 hours. Sputum has been copious and thick; however,
   culture data only consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Has coag (-)ve
   staph in urine; however, unlikely to be cause of fevers.
   - Foley change given bacterial colonization likely
   - Follow-up pending culture data
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   - PM lytes
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. 

The patient's recent events include being restarted on home lisinopril, an attempt to liberate from the ventilator by decreasing FiO2 and PEEP, with initial ABG showing pH 7.40, pCO2 54, and pO2 92. After several hours of reduced vent settings, the second ABG showed pH 7.44, pCO2 43, and pO2 65. Due to low pO2, FiO2 was increased back to 50%, and PEEP was increased to 12. Serial ABGs were performed, with the last one showing pH 7.43, pCO2 49, and pO2 136.

The patient continues to require bolus sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. Allergies are unknown. The patient has been on various medications including lisinopril, Bactrim, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, midazolam, and haloperidol.

On the vital signs flow sheet, the patient's temperature is 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate is 102 bpm, blood pressure ranges from 154/80 mmHg to 183/96 mmHg, respiratory rate is 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on FiO2 50%. The patient's height is 72 inches, and weight is not mentioned. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 3,640 mL and output of 1,705 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,935 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, set at CPAP/PSV mode, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is deferred due to PEEP > 10.

Physical examination findings include an intubated and sedated patient, with an endotracheal and orogastric tube in place. The patient has coarse anterior inspiratory wheeze and obesity with bowel sounds positive. Neurological examination reveals sedation and withdrawal to pain.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, glucose of 240 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 4"

   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode, with good
   response in oxygenation. Patient switched to CMV on [**4-17**] with PEEP at
   18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. Now stable with oxygen sats in the
   upper 90s. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis overall.
   Caridology consult assisted in ruling out pulmonary vein stenosis as
   cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation.
   TEE was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was
   consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for
   vasculitis, pulse dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24
   hours) were initiated on [**4-16**]. CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has
   been improving since admission; HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**]
   sputum with organisms on gram stain; however, no culture data at this
   time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM are negative; however, with elevated CRP
   and encouraging response to steroids with improving vent setting and
   CXR, vasculitis is not ruled-out. Respiratory viral screen is
   negative.  Having issues with sedation and periodic agitation requiring
   boluses of midaz and fent.
   - Standing and PRN haldol to help manage sedation.
   - Check EKG this afternoon to monitor QTc.
   - Continue 60mg prednisone daily
   - Attempt to liberate from high PEEP today
   - Maintain even to slightly negative I/O
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 24 hours; however, temp has been in low 100s.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol and lisinopril due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Last 24 hours BPs 130s-150s systolic when patient comfortable with
   paroxysms of BP to 200s systolic with agitation. We were holding home
   atenolol, lisinopril, tamsulosin due to hypotension at admission.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids.
   - Insulin drip for now then after steroids are weaned can return to
   insulin sliding scale with glargine
   - Hold metformin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. 

The patient had an acute change in respiratory status on the evening of [4-15] when he experienced progressive hypoxia and tachypnea, leading to emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation on standard vent modes prompted the placement of an airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode, which resulted in improved oxygenation. The patient was then switched to continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode with a PEEP of 18 and FiO2 titrated down to 50%. 

Currently, the patient is stable with oxygen saturation in the upper 90s. The cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis remains unknown. Cardiology consultation ruled out pulmonary vein stenosis as the cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. A bronchoscopy on [4-16] showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. 

Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse-dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Foley change (urine culture with staph) uneventful
   - Patient did continue to require high dose fent/midaz as would become
   agitated and desat whenever moved
   - Haldol was increased. QTc measured at 420 however this should be
   followed closely as patient is also on Sotalol.
   - Plan to diurese however BP remained low through most of the day
   making it difficult to give Lasix. Low BP thought to be due to

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission;
   HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram
   stain; however, no culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM
   are negative; however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to
   steroids with improving vent setting and CXR, vasculitis is not
   ruled-out and is furthermore the leading diagnosis at this time.
   Respiratory viral screen is negative.  Having issues with sedation and
   periodic agitation requiring boluses of midaz and fent. Currently
   tolerating pressure support ventilation with 8 over 12 and FiO2 of 50%.
   - Standing and PRN haldol (single dose up to 5 mg) to help manage
   sedation.
   - Use telemetry to monitor QTc.
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis
   - Liberate PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 24 hours. Sputum has been copious and thick; however,
   culture data only consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Has coag (-)ve
   staph in urine; however, unlikely to be cause of fevers.
   - Foley change given bacterial colonization likely
   - Follow-up pending culture data
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   - PM lytes
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred to the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient experienced an acute change in respiratory status, leading to emergent intubation. He had difficulty with oxygenation on standard vent modes, so he was placed on APRV mode initially, which showed a good response in oxygenation. The cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis remains unknown.

A cardiology consult ruled out pulmonary vein stenosis as the cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. A bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Pulse-dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated due to concern for vasculitis. The patient's CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission; HCT has been stable at 25-26. Sputum on [**2111-4-19**] showed organisms on gram stain, but no culture data is available yet.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and hemoptysis. He continues to require high-dose fentanyl and midazolam due to agitation and desaturation when moved. Haldol was increased, but the patient's QTc is 420, which should be closely monitored as he is also on Sotalol. The patient's blood pressure remained low throughout the day, making it difficult to give Lasix. This low blood pressure is thought to be due to sedation. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, interstitial lung disease, and is now showing signs of fever, hypotension, and potential sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, low blood pressure, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, leading to sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and hemoptysis indicate respiratory distress, which could progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's history of type II diabetes mellitus increases the risk for DKA, especially if there is inadequate blood glucose control.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of Sotalol, which can affect heart rhythm, increase the risk for cardiac arrhythm"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Foley change (urine culture with staph) uneventful
   - Patient did continue to require high dose fent/midaz as would become
   agitated and desat whenever moved
   - Haldol was increased. QTc measured at 420 however this should be
   followed closely as patient is also on Sotalol.
   - Plan to diurese however BP remained low through most of the day
   making it difficult to give Lasix. Low BP thought to be due to
   sedation.
   - Vent settings decreased to pressure support 8 over 8 with stable FiO2

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission;
   HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram
   stain; however, no culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM
   are negative; however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to
   steroids with improving vent setting and CXR, vasculitis is not
   ruled-out and is furthermore the leading diagnosis at this time.
   Respiratory viral screen is negative.  Having issues with sedation and
   periodic agitation requiring boluses of midaz and fent. Unable to
   assess underlying mental status due to sedation requirements to
   ventilate properly. Addition of haldol did not significantly change
   bolus sedation requirements for midaz and fent. Will need to consider
   change from fent and midaz drips to propofol for quicker reduction of
   sedation once extubation imminent. Currently tolerating pressure
   support ventilation with 8 over 8 and FiO2 of 50%.
   - Change sedation to propofol from fent and midaz drips
   - Standing haldol to help manage sedation.
   - Use telemetry to monitor QTc and check evening EKG changes
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis once dosing and
   delivery are determined
   - Liberate from PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Collect new sputum culture
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 48 hours. Sputum has been copious and thick; however,
   culture data only consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Has coag (-)ve
   staph in urine; however, unlikely to be cause of fevers. Foley was
   changed. Increased secretions by suctioning mya be attributed to
   unrecognized infection; however, has been Afebrile with stable white
   count in last few days.
   - Collect new sputum culture
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids. Insulin drip off and
   has FSBS in last 24 hours ranging from 142 to 245. Should titrate up
   basal insulin.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with complaints of hypoxia and hemoptysis. The patient requires high doses of fentanyl/midazolam to manage agitation and maintain oxygen saturation. Haldol is increased, but QTc measurement shows 420, which should be closely monitored due to the patient's use of Sotalol.

Throughout the day, the patient undergoes a Foley change with an uneventful urine culture positive for staph. The plan to diurese is hindered by low blood pressure, likely due to sedation. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Infusions include midazolam at 8 mg/hour, fentanyl at 150 mcg/hour, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other ICU medications include lansoprazole, furosemide (Lasix), and haloperidol (Haldol). 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the chief complaints mentioned earlier. Vital signs show a temperature within normal range, heart rate slightly elevated but within acceptable limits, blood pressure on the lower side, respiratory rate decreased, and oxygen saturation at 99%.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, total fluid intake of 3,476 mL, and total fluid output of 2,545 mL. Blood products and urine output are within expected ranges.

Respiratory support includes CPAP/PS"

   - Haldol was increased. QTc measured at 420 however this should be
   followed closely as patient is also on Sotalol.
   - Plan to diurese however BP remained low through most of the day

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission;
   HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram
   stain; however, no culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM
   are negative; however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to
   steroids with improving vent setting and CXR, vasculitis is not
   ruled-out and is furthermore the leading diagnosis at this time.
   Respiratory viral screen is negative.  Having issues with sedation and
   periodic agitation requiring boluses of midaz and fent. Currently
   tolerating pressure support ventilation with 8 over 12 and FiO2 of 50%.
   - Standing and PRN haldol (single dose up to 5 mg) to help manage
   sedation.
   - Use telemetry to monitor QTc.
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis
   - Liberate PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 24 hours. Sputum has been copious and thick; however,
   culture data only consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Has coag (-)ve
   staph in urine; however, unlikely to be cause of fevers.
   - Foley change given bacterial colonization likely
   - Follow-up pending culture data
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin until complete resolution of hemoptysis
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   - PM lytes
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was transferred from another hospital with symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. Upon admission, the patient had an acute change in respiratory status, leading to emergent intubation. Despite oxygenation difficulties with standard vent modes, the patient responded well to APRV mode. The cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis remains unknown.

Initial tests including bronchoscopy showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and the patient was started on pulse-dose steroids due to concern for vasculitis. The patient's CRP level was elevated, but ANCA, [Doctor's First Name], and anti-GBM tests were negative. However, with an improving response to steroids and encouraging trends in ventilator settings and chest X-ray, vasculitis is still considered a leading diagnosis. Respiratory viral screen was negative.

The patient has been experiencing issues with sedation and periodic agitation, requiring boluses of midazolam and fentanyl. Currently, the patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation with 8 cmH2O pressure support and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's QTc is being monitored using telemetry"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission;
   HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram
   stain; however, no culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM
   are negative; however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to
   steroids with improving vent setting and CXR, vasculitis is not
   ruled-out and is furthermore the leading diagnosis at this time.
   Respiratory viral screen is negative.  Having issues with sedation and
   periodic agitation requiring boluses of midaz and fent. Unable to
   assess underlying mental status due to sedation requirements to
   ventilate properly. Addition of haldol did not significantly change
   bolus sedation requirements for midaz and fent. Will need to consider
   change from fent and midaz drips to propofol for quicker reduction of
   sedation once extubation imminent. Currently tolerating pressure
   support ventilation with 8 over 8 and FiO2 of 50%.
   - Change sedation to propofol from fent and midaz drips
   - Standing haldol to help manage sedation.
   - Use telemetry to monitor QTc and check evening EKG changes
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis once dosing and
   delivery are determined
   - Liberate from PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Collect new sputum culture
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 48 hours. Sputum has been copious and thick; however,
   culture data only consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Has coag (-)ve
   staph in urine; however, unlikely to be cause of fevers. Foley was
   changed. Increased secretions by suctioning mya be attributed to
   unrecognized infection; however, has been Afebrile with stable white
   count in last few days.
   - Collect new sputum culture
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids. Insulin drip off and
   has FSBS in last 24 hours ranging from 142 to 245. Should titrate up
   basal insulin.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient's condition has been unstable with intermittent hypoxia and difficulty in oxygenation despite being on various ventilator modes. A bronchoscopy showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, leading to a suspicion of vasculitis. The patient has been treated with pulse dose steroids and is currently responding well to therapy. Other findings include elevated CRP levels, negative ANCA, anti-GBM antibodies, and respiratory viral screen. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and is currently on insulin therapy. Additionally, he has developed oral thrush likely due to high-dose steroids. The patient is intubated and sedated, requiring frequent boluses of midazolam and fentanyl for sedation. Propofol is planned to be used for sedation once extubation is imminent. The patient's blood pressure is controlled with lisinopril, and his diabetes is being managed with glargine insulin and a sliding scale of humalog. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and his condition is being closely monitored. Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infections, bleeding due to anticoag"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission;
   HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram
   stain; however, no culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM
   are negative; however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to
   steroids with improving vent setting and CXR, vasculitis is not
   ruled-out and is furthermore the leading diagnosis at this time.
   Respiratory viral screen is negative.  Having issues with sedation and
   periodic agitation requiring boluses of midaz and fent. Unable to
   assess underlying mental status due to sedation requirements to
   ventilate properly. Addition of haldol did not significantly change
   bolus sedation requirements for midaz and fent. Will need to consider
   change from fent and midaz drips to propofol for quicker reduction of
   sedation once extubation imminent. Currently tolerating pressure
   support ventilation with 8 over 8 and FiO2 of 50%.
   - Change sedation to propofol from fent and midaz drips
   - Standing haldol to help manage sedation.
   - Use telemetry to monitor QTc and check evening EKG changes
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis once dosing and
   delivery are determined
   - Liberate from PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Collect new sputum culture
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 48 hours. Sputum has been copious and thick; however,
   culture data only consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Has coag (-)ve
   staph in urine; however, unlikely to be cause of fevers. Foley was
   changed. Increased secretions by suctioning mya be attributed to
   unrecognized infection; however, has been Afebrile with stable white
   count in last few days.
   - Collect new sputum culture
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids. Insulin drip off and
   has FSBS in last 24 hours ranging from 142 to 245. Should titrate up
   basal insulin.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (AFib) after recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital with symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. He has been receiving various medications including Lasix, cytoxan, midazolam, fentanyl, haloperidol, and heparin sodium.

   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission;
   HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram
   stain; however, no culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM
   are negative; however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to
   steroids with improving vent setting and CXR, vasculitis is not
   ruled-out and is furthermore the leading diagnosis at this time.
   Respiratory viral screen is negative.  Due to sedation management
   issues, was switched from fent/midaz to propofol drip on [**2111-4-23**].
   Currently tolerating pressure support ventilation with 8 over 8 and
   FiO2 of 40%. Had RSBIs this AM of ~ 40 and ~ 30, which are reassuring
   that he may be ready for extrubation. SBT is still pending.
   - Lighten propofol and attempt SBT with ABG following
   - Extubation pending result of SBT
   - Change haldol to PRN once extubated
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis at dose of 250 mg
   daily for 6 days followed by 150 mg daily
   - Will need weekly CBC with diff and daily LFTs to monitor of toxicity
   of cyclophosphamide while starting drug
   - Collect Mini-BAL prior to extubation
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Low grade fever to 100.3 last night. Sputum has been copious and thick;
   however, culture data only consistent with oropharyngeal [**Year (4 digits) **]. Repeat
   sputum on [**4-23**] had gram stain of oropharyngeal [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] get mini-BAL
   today prior to extubation.
   - Collect Mini-BAL prior to extubation
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added. Will watch for
   hypertension following decrease and cessation of sedation once
   extubated.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   - Consider adding on metoprolol (atenolol has been on hold) if
   pressures elevated once sedation comes off
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids. Had high FSBS in
   early AM, perhaps related to prednisone dose at night. Will increase
   night sliding scale.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient underwent emergent intubation due to acute respiratory distress. Initially, he was placed on airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode with good oxygenation response. However, the cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis remains unknown.

Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and pulse-dose steroids were initiated due to concern for vasculitis. The patient's CRP was elevated at 24, and he has been tolerating pressure support ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. His recent respiratory status has been improving, with reassuring RSBIs.

The patient's sedation management issues led to a switch from fentanyl/midazolam to propofol drip. He is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation with 8 cmH2O pressure support and a FiO2 of 40%. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is pending, and weaning from the ventilator is planned once the SBT is successful. The patient's tracheostomy tube size is 8 Ch.

The patient's other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He has been on high-dose steroids for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of hypoxia and hemoptysis. They have a history of diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, interstitial lung disease, and activity intolerance. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving oxygen supplementation through an endotracheal tube. Their vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/47 mmHg to 195/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. They also have elevated creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate acid levels. The patient's ABG analysis indicates a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, HCO3- of 31 mEq/L, and PO2/FiO2 ratio of 340.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient's medical history, and current condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased blood flow can increase the risk of blood clot formation.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and use of certain medications can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels may indicate impaired kidney function.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is not provided, but given their history of diabetes, there is a risk of fluctuating blood sugar levels.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, but the presence of hypoxia and potential underlying lung disease increases the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Septic shock: Elevated white blood cell count and fever could suggest an ongoing infection, which may progress to septic shock if not managed promptly.

Please note that this is a summary and analysis of the patient's medical progress note. The identified potential medical complications are based on the information provided, but additional clinical assessments and tests would be necessary to confirm their presence."

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission;
   HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram
   stain; however, no culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM
   are negative; however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to
   steroids with improving vent setting and CXR, vasculitis is not
   ruled-out and is furthermore the leading diagnosis at this time.
   Respiratory viral screen is negative.  Having issues with sedation and
   periodic agitation requiring boluses of midaz and fent. Unable to
   assess underlying mental status due to sedation requirements to
   ventilate properly. Addition of haldol did not significantly change
   bolus sedation requirements for midaz and fent. Will need to consider
   change from fent and midaz drips to propofol for quicker reduction of
   sedation once extubation imminent. Currently tolerating pressure
   support ventilation with 8 over 8 and FiO2 of 50%.
   - Change sedation to propofol from fent and midaz drips
   - Standing haldol to help manage sedation.
   - Use telemetry to monitor QTc and check evening EKG changes
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis once dosing and
   delivery are determined
   - Liberate from PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Collect new sputum culture
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 48 hours. Sputum has been copious and thick; however,
   culture data only consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Has coag (-)ve
   staph in urine; however, unlikely to be cause of fevers. Foley was
   changed. Increased secretions by suctioning mya be attributed to
   unrecognized infection; however, has been Afebrile with stable white
   count in last few days.
   - Collect new sputum culture
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids. Insulin drip off and
   has FSBS in last 24 hours ranging from 142 to 245. Should titrate up
   basal insulin.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) after recent ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital with complaints of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient underwent emergent intubation due to progressive hypoxia and tachypnea. He has been difficult to oxygenate with standard vent modes, so he was placed on APRV mode initially, with good response in oxygenation. The cause of hypoxia and hemoptysis is still unknown. A cardiology consult ruled out pulmonary vein stenosis as a cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia following atrial-fib ablation. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for pulmonary vein stenosis. A bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse-dose steroids (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**]. CRP was elevated at 24.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old man with respiratory failure and alveolar hemorrhage.
- He is currently on propofol and requires only a low dose.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- He is receiving multiple medications in the ICU, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lasix, lipitor, colchicine, ropinirole, prevacid, sotalol, bactrim, vitamin D, b12, prednisone 60mg, and lisinopril.
- His medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, is unchanged from admission except where noted above.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.9 to 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 83-116 bpm, blood pressure between 92/47 mmHg and 169/83 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%.
- The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.
- His fluid balance shows an intake of 3,452 mL and output of 5,980 mL since midnight.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.
- His blood gases show a pH of 7.53, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 75 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 188, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%.
- The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 9.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 203 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 15 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dL, glucose of 130 mg/dL, and various other lab values.
- Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, alveolar hemorrhage, and ICU care.
- The patient is expected to be extubated after improvement.
- The patient is currently on prednisone for alveolar hemorrhage and will start cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) at 250mg/day for 6 days, followed by 150mg/day.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation support. If there is no improvement or further deterioration, the patient may experience respiratory arrest or require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Alveolar Hemorrhage: The patient has alveolar hemorrhage, and if not managed appropriately, there is a risk of worsening bleeding, leading to hypoxemia, respiratory distress, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient is immunosuppressed due to his medical condition and medications. This puts him at a higher risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bloodstream infections, or urinary tract infections.
4. Bleeding: As the patient is on anticoagulant therapy with heparin, there is a risk of bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic shock or internal bleeding.
5. Medication Side Effects: Some of the medications the patient is receiving may have potential side effects, such as sedation, hypotension, or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's kidney function (evidenced by the BUN and Cr levels) is slightly elevated, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
7. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the endotracheal tube can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
8. Ventilator-Associated Events: Being on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated events, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-induced lung injury, or endotracheal tube complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has been improving since admission;
   HCT has been stable at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram
   stain; however, no culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM
   are negative; however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to
   steroids with improving vent setting and CXR, vasculitis is not
   ruled-out and is furthermore the leading diagnosis at this time.
   Respiratory viral screen is negative.  Due to sedation management
   issues, was switched from fent/midaz to propofol drip on [**2111-4-23**].
   Currently tolerating pressure support ventilation with 8 over 8 and
   FiO2 of 40%. Had RSBIs this AM of ~ 40 and ~ 30, which are reassuring
   that he may be ready for extrubation. SBT is still pending.
   - Lighten propofol and attempt SBT with ABG following
   - Extubation pending result of SBT
   - Change haldol to PRN once extubated
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis at dose of 250 mg
   daily for 6 days followed by 150 mg daily
   - Will need weekly CBC with diff and daily LFTs to monitor of toxicity
   of cyclophosphamide while starting drug
   - Collect Mini-BAL prior to extubation
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   # Fever:
   Low grade fever to 100.3 last night. Sputum has been copious and thick;
   however, culture data only consistent with oropharyngeal [**Year (4 digits) **]. Repeat
   sputum on [**4-23**] had gram stain of oropharyngeal [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] get mini-BAL
   today prior to extubation.
   - Collect Mini-BAL prior to extubation
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added. Will watch for
   hypertension following decrease and cessation of sedation once
   extubated.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   - Consider adding on metoprolol (atenolol has been on hold) if
   pressures elevated once sedation comes off
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids. Had high FSBS in
   early AM, perhaps related to prednisone dose at night. Will increase
   night sliding scale.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed

   Disposition: in ICU pending improvement in respiratory status
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. The patient required emergent intubation due to progressive hypoxia and tachypnea. Initially, he was placed on APRV mode, which showed good oxygenation response. A bronchoscopy revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and the patient was started on pulse-dose steroids for vasculitis. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved since admission, and he is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation with FiO2 of 40%. His recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results show reassuring values, indicating that he may be ready for extubation. However, a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) is still pending.

The patient's fever is low-grade and associated with copious thick secretions. A Mini-BAL is planned prior to extubation to investigate the cause of his fever. 

The patient's cardiac status includes a recent atrial fibrillation ablation, and he is currently in sinus rhythm. His coronary artery disease has been ruled out for myocardial infarction at presentation.

The patient's hypertension and hypotension are being managed with lisinopril and close monitoring. His diabetes is being"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall male with a low-grade fever and persistent thick secretions. They were started on empiric Vanc and Zosyn, and a mini-BAL was performed. The patient self-extubated prior to formal extubation and was somewhat groggy with oxygen saturation levels in the high 80s and low 90s. However, these improved as mental status cleared throughout the day and night. It was decided to defer cytoxan treatment until the patient could reliably swallow on his own. The patient tolerated sips of clear liquids during a bedside swallow test by the nurse.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, and all allergies are noted. The last doses of antibiotics were administered on [**2111-4-24**]. The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. There are no changes to the medical and family history.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), current temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 74 bpm with a range of 72-102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/67 mmHg to 180/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 15-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

The patient has been receiving empiric antibiotics (Vanc and Zosyn) for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and underwent mini-BAL. The patient self-extubated prior to formal extubation and was groggy with oxygen saturation levels in the high 80s and low 90s. However, these improved as the patient's mental status cleared.

The patient tolerates sips of clear liquids and is being prepared for extubation. No known drug allergies were reported. The patient received Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, and Heparin Sodium infusions. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but their blood pressure is on the lower end. Respiratory rate and heart rate are within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 90%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and central venous pressure is -4 mmHg.

   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has now stopped; HCT has been stable
   at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram stain; however, no
   culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM are negative;
   however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to steroids.
   vasculitis is the leading diagnosis at this time. Respiratory viral
   screen is negative.  Due to sedation management issues, was switched
   from fent/midaz to propofol drip on [**2111-4-23**], and is now off after
   self-extubation yesterday. Patient is still groggy with tenuous
   respiratory status ~90% O2 sat.
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis at dose of 250 mg
   daily for 6 days followed by 150 mg daily
   - Will need weekly CBC with diff and daily LFTs to monitor of toxicity
   of cyclophosphamide while starting drug
   - f/u Mini-BAL culture
   - cont vanc and zosyn for now, will discontinue if nothing grows in BAL
   culture
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   - set up CPAP at night (patient can use his own CPAP machine if family
   can bring from home).
   # Fever:
   Low grade fevers in past couple of days, though afebrile in last 24
   hours. Sputum has been copious and thick; however, culture data only
   consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Repeat sputum on [**4-23**] had gram
   stain of oropharyngeal flora, mini-BAL results pending.
   - cont vanc/zosyn for now, will discontinue if mini-BAL results are
   negative.
   - f/u Mini-BAL
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added. Will watch for
   hypertension following decrease and cessation of sedation once
   extubated.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   - Consider adding on metoprolol (atenolol has been on hold) if
   pressures elevated once sedation comes off
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids. Had high FSBS in
   early AM, perhaps related to prednisone dose at night. Will increase
   night sliding scale.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale, can
   adjust as patient begins to eat
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed
   Will attempt to obtain peripheral access today so right IJ can be
   discontinued.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (AFib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient had an acute change in respiratory status, leading to emergent intubation. Despite being placed on APRV mode, the patient had difficulty with oxygenation. A bronchoscopy showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and the patient was started on pulse-dose steroids for suspected vasculitis. The patient's hemoptysis has stopped, and his HCT has stabilized between 25-26. 

The patient also has a fever with low-grade temperatures in the past few days. Sputum cultures only showed oropharyngeal flora. The mini-BAL results are pending, and the patient is currently on vancomycin and zosyn. 

The patient's recent AFib ablation was successful, as he is now in sinus rhythm. His coronary artery disease has been ruled out for myocardial infarction at presentation. 

The patient's blood pressure has been better controlled with lisinopril, and he will be monitored for hypertension following the decrease and cessation of sedation once extubated. 

The patient's diabetes management includes increasing the night sliding scale for hyperglycemia related to prednisone and diabetes. Met"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has now stopped; HCT has been stable
   at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram stain; however, no
   culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM are negative;
   however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to steroids.
   vasculitis is the leading diagnosis at this time. Respiratory viral
   screen is negative.  Due to sedation management issues, was switched
   from fent/midaz to propofol drip on [**2111-4-23**], and is now off after
   self-extubation yesterday. Patient is still groggy with tenuous
   respiratory status ~90% O2 sat.
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Initiate cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis at dose of 250 mg
   daily for 6 days followed by 150 mg daily
   - Will need weekly CBC with diff and daily LFTs to monitor of toxicity
   of cyclophosphamide while starting drug
   - f/u Mini-BAL culture
   - cont vanc and zosyn for now, will discontinue if nothing grows in BAL
   culture
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   - set up CPAP at night (patient can use his own CPAP machine if family
   can bring from home).
   # Fever:
   Low grade fevers in past couple of days, though afebrile in last 24
   hours. Sputum has been copious and thick; however, culture data only
   consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Repeat sputum on [**4-23**] had gram
   stain of oropharyngeal flora, mini-BAL results pending.
   - cont vanc/zosyn for now, will discontinue if mini-BAL results are
   negative.
   - f/u Mini-BAL
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added. Will watch for
   hypertension following decrease and cessation of sedation once
   extubated.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   - Consider adding on metoprolol (atenolol has been on hold) if
   pressures elevated once sedation comes off
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids. Had high FSBS in
   early AM, perhaps related to prednisone dose at night. Will increase
   night sliding scale.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale, can
   adjust as patient begins to eat
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed
   Will attempt to obtain peripheral access today so right IJ can be
   discontinued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) after recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient underwent emergent intubation due to acute respiratory status change. Oxygenation difficulties led to the use of an airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode. Bronchoscopy showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The patient was started on pulse dose steroids for concern of vasculitis, and his hemoptysis has since stopped. His HCT has stabilized at 25-26. A sputum culture revealed organisms on gram stain, but no culture data is available yet. ANCA, [Doctor's first name], and anti-GBM are negative, but vasculitis remains the leading diagnosis. The patient's respiratory viral screen is negative. He was switched from fentanyl/midazolam to propofol drip on [2111-4-23] and extubated yesterday but remains groggy with tenuous respiratory status at approximately 90% O2 saturation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis led to emergent intubation and mechanical ventilation. He continues to require respiratory support, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This condition can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, interstitial lung disease, and obesity. He was admitted to the ICU for activity intolerance and fever of unknown origin. He received antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin) for suspected infection but continues to have a fever. His vital signs show hypotension and tachypnea. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals respiratory acidosis with an elevated PaCO2. His oxygen saturation is maintained at 95% through respiratory support. Fluid balance shows an overall negative balance. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22000/mm3, elevated lactate level, and elevated cardiac enzymes (CK and CKMB). Other lab results are within normal limits. The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress and normal neurological function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory acidosis and elevated PaCO2 indicate respiratory distress, which could progress to ARDS if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD; transfer
   from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / hemoptysis:
   Likely inter-related processes. Patient had acute change in respiratory
   status on evening of [**4-15**] when he had progressive hypoxia and tachypnea
   leading to an emergent intubation. Difficulty with oxygenation with
   standard vent modes led to patient being placed on APRV mode initially,
   with good response in oxygenation. Still with unknown cause of hypoxia
   and hemoptysis overall. Caridology consult assisted in ruling out
   pulmonary vein stenosis as cause of acute hemoptysis and hypoxia
   following atrial-fib ablation. TEE was negative for pulmonary vein
   stenosis. Bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] was consistent with diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage. Due to concern for vasculitis, pulse dose steroids
   (methylprednisolone at 1 gram every 24 hours) were initiated on [**4-16**].
   CRP was elevated at 24. Hemoptysis has now stopped; HCT has been stable
   at 25-26. [**2111-4-19**] sputum with organisms on gram stain; however, no
   culture data at this time. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], and anti-GBM are negative;
   however, with elevated CRP and encouraging response to steroids.
   vasculitis is the leading diagnosis at this time. Respiratory viral
   screen is negative.  Due to sedation management issues, was switched
   from fent/midaz to propofol drip on [**2111-4-23**], and is now off after
   self-extubation yesterday. Appears improved today, maintaining sats in
   mid 90s on 5 L NC.
   - Continue 60 mg prednisone daily
   - Cyclophosphamide for presumed vasculitis at dose of 250 mg daily for
   6 days followed by 150 mg daily
   - Will need weekly CBC with diff and daily LFTs to monitor of toxicity
   of cyclophosphamide while starting drug
   - f/u Mini-BAL culture
   - cont vanc and zosyn for now, will discontinue if nothing grows in BAL
   culture
   - Continue to trend HCT
   - Maintain active type and screen and transfuse for HCT less than 21
   - Hold aspirin and warfarin
   - needs repeat CPAP testing for OSA
   - transfer to floor today
   # Fever:
   Low grade fevers in past couple of days, though afebrile in last 48
   hours. Sputum has been copious and thick; however, culture data only
   consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Repeat sputum on [**4-23**] had gram
   stain of oropharyngeal flora, mini-BAL results pending.
   - cont vanc/zosyn for now, will discontinue if mini-BAL results are
   negative.
   - f/u Mini-BAL
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   # Afib:
   s/p recent ablation.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Hold warfarin
   - Hold atenolol due to periodic hypotension
   # Coronary artery disease:
   Ruled out for MI at presentation.
   - Continue statin and lisinopril
   - Hold home aspirin
   - Hold home atenolol due to hypotension after admission
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Baseline BP better controlled with lisinopril added. Will watch for
   hypertension following decrease and cessation of sedation once
   extubated.
   - Continue lisinopril 5 mg
   - Consider adding on metoprolol (atenolol has been on hold) if
   pressures elevated once sedation comes off
   # DM:
   Hyperglycemia in setting of diabetes and steroids. Had high FSBS in
   early AM, perhaps related to prednisone dose at night. Will increase
   night sliding scale.
   - Glargine insulin twice daily as well as humalog sliding scale, can
   adjust as patient begins to eat
   - Hold metformin
   # Thrush:
   Likely related to high dose steroids.
   - Oral nystatin as needed
   Will attempt to obtain peripheral access today so right IJ can be
   discontinued.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) post recent ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. The patient had acute changes in respiratory status, leading to emergent intubation. Oxygenation difficulties with standard vent modes prompted the use of APRV mode, which showed good response. The patient's condition is still unknown, and further evaluation is needed.

A bronchoscopy on [**4-16**] showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and pulse-dose steroids were initiated due to concern for vasculitis. The CRP level was elevated at 24, and hemoptysis has stopped. The patient's HCT has been stable between 25-26. Sputum from [**2111-4-19**] showed organisms on gram stain, but no culture data is available yet. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name**], and anti-GBM tests are negative; however, with elevated CRP and an encouraging response to steroids, vasculitis remains the leading diagnosis. Respiratory viral screen is negative.

The patient was switched from fent/midaz to propofol drip on [**2111-4-23**] and was extubated yesterday. He appears improved today, maintaining sats in the mid-90s"
