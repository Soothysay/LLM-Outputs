   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year-old man with a history of CAD s/p MI, NSCLC, and
   diverticulosis who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1896**] for LGIB and chest pain and is
   transferred to the MICU for management of worsened LGIB.
   # GI bleed:  Likely lower GI diverticular bleed, as patient has BRBPR
   and history of severe diverticulosis.  Also on differential are colonic
   mass, AVM, and colitis, though these are less likely.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable but history of CAD places him at higher risk of
   demand ischemia in the setting of anemia.  S/p 4u prbc.
   - has 3 PIVs (18G) for access
   - maintain active type and screen
   - hct checks q6hr
   - transfuse to maintain hct of 30
   - consider platelet transfusion given aspirin use
   - IR aware
   - surgery aware
   - will discuss colonoscopy with GI given persistent bleeding
   # CAD: Has history of prior NSTEMIs and is s/p PCI.  Positive troponin
   and neg CK/CK-MB during this admission suggests prior ACS vs demand
   ischemia in the setting of anemia, though lowest hct only 28.  Given
   risk of life threatening bleed, will hold aspirin for now; plavix and
   heparin were not started after admission b/c of bleeding.  CP free at
   this time.  Discussed with cards fellow.
   - not on beta blocker at home and would not start at this time
   - hold aspirin
   - continue statin
   # BPH: Stable.
   - Continue finasteride

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mr. [**Known lastname **], an 85-year-old man with a history of CAD, NSCLC, diverticulosis, and previous MI, was admitted for LGIB and chest pain. He is now in the MICU for worsening LGIB. His recent nuclear medicine scan was negative, but he experienced two episodes of blood loss requiring transfusion. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 116/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a history of severe diverticulosis and is at risk for demand ischemia due to anemia. He has received 4 units of packed red blood cells and maintains active type and screen. The plan is to continue monitoring his hemoglobin levels every 6 hours and transfuse as needed to maintain a hematocrit of 30. Platelet transfusion is also being considered due to aspirin use. Surgery and interventional radiology are aware of the situation, and a colonoscopy will be discussed with the GI team given persistent bleeding. The patient has a history of prior NSTEMIs and is post-PCI. Positive troponin and negative CK/CK-MB suggest prior ACS rather than demand ischemia. Aspirin will be held for now, while Plavix and heparin were not started"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and diverticulosis. He was admitted for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and chest pain and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for management of worsened LGIB.

The patient has had two episodes of blood loss resulting in a hemoglobin drop from 29.9 to 26.2 g/dL, and he received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/75 to 152/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 177 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 26.2 g/dL, decreased hematocrit of 27.6%, and normal platelet count of 196 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. GI bleed: The patient is likely experiencing a lower GI diverticular bleed, given his history of severe diverticulosis. Other possible causes include"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with lower gastrointestinal (LGI) bleed and has experienced recurrent bloody bowel movements, leading to a decrease in hematocrit (Hct) levels. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (prbc) since admission. A tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan was performed, which was negative for active bleeding. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they remain critically ill with evidence of ongoing bleeding. The plan is to prepare the patient for a colonoscopy in the morning and involve surgery. The patient's Hct levels will be monitored every 6 hours, and prbc transfusion will be given as needed to maintain Hct around 30%. The patient's antiplatelet agent (ASA) is on hold due to the gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and will be restarted once the patient is stable. The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), stage 2B, which has been treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient is currently on NPO (nothing by mouth) status except for medications. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding indicates a high risk of re-bleeding, which can lead to further anemia and hemodynamic instability.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy and prolonged"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year-old man with a history of CAD s/p MI, NSCLC, and
   diverticulosis who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1896**] for LGIB and chest pain and is
   transferred to the MICU for management of worsened LGIB.
   # GI bleed:  Likely lower GI diverticular bleed, as patient has BRBPR
   and history of severe diverticulosis.  Also on differential are colonic
   mass, AVM, and colitis, though these are less likely.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable but history of CAD places him at higher risk of
   demand ischemia in the setting of anemia.  S/p 1U prbc yesterday.
   - Colonoscopy without evident source b ut multiple diver/la.
   - Maintatin 3 PIVs (18G) for access
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - hct checks q6hr (10 am, 4 PM)
   - transfuse to maintain hct of 30
   - F/U surgery
   # CAD: Has history of prior NSTEMIs and is s/p PCI.  Positive troponin
   and neg CK/CK-MB during this admission suggests prior ACS vs demand
   ischemia in the setting of anemia, though lowest hct only 28.  Given
   risk of life threatening bleed, will hold aspirin for now; plavix and
   heparin were not started after admission b/c of bleeding.  CP free at
   this time.  Discussed with cards fellow.
   - not on beta blocker at home and would not start at this time
   - hold aspirin, restart low dose aspirin once HCT stabilizes. d/c
   plavix.
   - continue statin
   # NSCLC: Has stage IIb lesion in RUL diagnosed in [**2-25**], s/p
   chemotherapy and radiation.  Patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4197**].
   - will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4197**] as an outpatient
   # BPH: Stable.
   - Continue finasteride
   # Dyslipidemia:
   - Continue simvastatin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), diverticulosis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He was admitted for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and chest pain, and is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for management of worsened LGIB.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/57 to 109/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. He has a first-degree atrioventricular block. Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,135 mL and output of 4,400 mL, with a positive balance of 735 mL. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids, blood products, and antibiotics as needed.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, crackles in the chest, edema in both lower extremities, and a distended abdomen. Neurological assessment shows the patient attentive, following simple commands, and responsive to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results indicate a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 29.9%, platelet count of 196,000/mmÂ³, creatinine level of 0.7 mg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells due to a low hematocrit level. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/39 to 159/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a first-degree atrioventricular block. Fluid balance shows an intake of 5135 mL and output of 4400 mL, with a negative balance of 735 mL. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and is receiving respiratory support. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and the neurologic examination is incomplete. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with normal potassium and sodium levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleed, which can lead to hypovolemia and shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, indicating episodes of hypotension, which can result in inadequate organ perfusion.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year-old man with a history of CAD s/p MI, NSCLC, and
   diverticulosis who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1896**] for LGIB and chest pain and is
   transferred to the MICU for management of worsened LGIB.
   # GI bleed:  Likely lower GI diverticular bleed, as patient has BRBPR
   and history of severe diverticulosis.  Also on differential are colonic
   mass, AVM, and colitis, though these are less likely.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable but history of CAD places him at higher risk of
   demand ischemia in the setting of anemia.  S/p 1U prbc yesterday.
   - Colonoscopy today to assess etiology of GI bleed
   - Maintatin 3 PIVs (18G) for access
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - hct checks q6hr (10 am, 4 PM)
   - transfuse to maintain hct of 30
   - F/U IR and surgery
   # CAD: Has history of prior NSTEMIs and is s/p PCI.  Positive troponin
   and neg CK/CK-MB during this admission suggests prior ACS vs demand
   ischemia in the setting of anemia, though lowest hct only 28.  Given
   risk of life threatening bleed, will hold aspirin for now; plavix and
   heparin were not started after admission b/c of bleeding.  CP free at
   this time.  Discussed with cards fellow.
   - not on beta blocker at home and would not start at this time
   - hold aspirin
   - continue statin
   # NSCLC: Has stage IIb lesion in RUL diagnosed in [**2-25**], s/p
   chemotherapy and radiation.  Patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4197**].
   - will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4197**] as an outpatient
   # BPH: Stable.
   - Continue finasteride
   # Dyslipidemia:
   - Continue simvastatin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and diverticulosis. He was admitted for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and chest pain, and then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to worsening LGIB. The patient is hemodynamically stable but has a risk of demand ischemia due to anemia. He received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday and is scheduled for a colonoscopy today to determine the cause of the GI bleed. 

The patient has a history of prior myocardial infarction (MI) and is post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There is a positive troponin and negative creatine kinase (CK)/CK-MB during this admission, suggesting prior acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rather than demand ischemia in the setting of anemia. Aspirin is being held, while Plavix and heparin were not started due to bleeding concerns. 

The patient also has a history of stage IIb non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the right upper lobe, which was diagnosed on [**2-25**] and treated with chemotherapy and radiation. The patient is currently off beta-blockers and statins.

Other medical conditions include benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), for which the patient is taking finasteride, and dys"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, acute blood loss anemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and dementia. They have been admitted to the ICU and have received a transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to decreased hemoglobin levels.

The source of the GI bleed has not been identified, but the patient is currently stable hemodynamically. However, there is evidence of ongoing slow/active bleeding. The tagged red blood cell scan was negative, indicating that further intervention may not be necessary at this time. The patient's hemoglobin levels will be closely monitored, and they will receive additional PRBC transfusions as needed to maintain a target hemoglobin level of around 30%.

The patient's CAD is likely experiencing demand ischemia, and the use of antiplatelet medication (ASA) has been put on hold. Once the patient is stable from the GI bleeding, ASA will need to be restarted.

The patient also has a history of stage 2B NSCLC and has undergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Additionally, the patient has poor short-term memory due to dementia.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving clear liquids for nutrition, and their glycemic control will be monitored. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an 18-gauge line. Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis (D"

   # GI bleed:  Likely lower GI diverticular bleed, as patient has BRBPR
   and history of severe diverticulosis.  Also on differential are colonic
   mass, AVM, and colitis, though these are less likely.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable but history of CAD places him at higher risk of
   demand ischemia in the setting of anemia.  S/p 1U prbc yesterday.
   - Colonoscopy without evident source b ut multiple diver/la.
   - Maintatin 3 PIVs (18G) for access
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - hct checks q6hr (10 am, 4 PM)
   - transfuse to maintain hct of 30
   - F/U surgery
   # CAD: Has history of prior NSTEMIs and is s/p PCI.  Positive troponin
   and neg CK/CK-MB during this admission suggests prior ACS vs demand
   ischemia in the setting of anemia, though lowest hct only 28.  Given
   risk of life threatening bleed, will hold aspirin for now; plavix and
   heparin were not started after admission b/c of bleeding.  CP free at
   this time.  Discussed with cards fellow.
   - not on beta blocker at home and would not start at this time
   - hold aspirin, restart low dose aspirin once HCT stabilizes. d/c
   plavix.
   - continue statin
   # NSCLC: Has stage IIb lesion in RUL diagnosed in [**2-25**], s/p
   chemotherapy and radiation.  Patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4197**].
   - will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4197**] as an outpatient
   # BPH: Stable.
   - Continue finasteride
   # Dyslipidemia:
   - Continue simvastatin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, non-small cell lung cancer, diverticulosis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), and chest pain. He was admitted to the hospital for LGIB and chest pain and later transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to worsened LGIB. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a low blood count and received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday. He underwent a colonoscopy which did not reveal the source of bleeding but showed multiple diverticula. The patient has a history of prior non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He has positive troponin levels and negative creatine kinase (CK)/CK-MB during this admission, suggesting a prior acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rather than demand ischemia in the setting of anemia. His cardiac medications, including aspirin, Plavix, and heparin, have been withheld due to the risk of life-threatening bleeding. The patient also has a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a stage IIb lesion in the right upper lobe, treated with chemotherapy and radiation. His benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is stable, and he continues taking finasteride. The patient has dyslipidemia,"

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 85-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post myocardial infarction (MI), non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and diverticulosis. He was admitted to the hospital for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and chest pain and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for management of worsened LGIB. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (prbc) yesterday. He developed abdominal pain and distension after the colonoscopy, which improved when he passed a large amount of flatulence. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/48-181/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal limits. He has a history of prior non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and his troponin levels are positive, suggesting prior acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rather than demand ischemia due to anemia. He also has a history of stage IIb non-small cell lung carcinoma, treated with chemotherapy and radiation, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). His dyslipidemia is being managed with simvastatin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is currently on aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel (Plavix). He presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), likely of diverticular origin. The patient is now off antiplatelet agents, with stable hematocrit levels. The plan is to restart ASA tomorrow as per gastrointestinal recommendations, and to continue holding clopidogrel indefinitely. If bleeding recurs, a bleeding scan and interventional radiology (IR) may be necessary. Other issues are noted in the resident's progress notes. Plans include follow-up with oncology for palliative chemotherapy and restarting home medications for hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Given the patient's history of GIB, there is a risk of rebleeding, especially if antiplatelet agents are reintroduced or if the underlying cause of the bleeding is not adequately managed.
2. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and use of invasive lines and devices increase the risk of healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility, advanced age, and certain medical conditions can increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis with compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation should be continued.
