   ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
   [**Known firstname 160**] [**Known lastname 158**] is a 42 yo w/h/o EtOH abuse and recently identified
   pancreatic mass in the setting of weight loss who presented with GI
   bleed.
   #GI Bleed: Severe GI bleed according to drop in Hct. The patient is
   fairly hemodynamically stable for such a large blood loss.  Seems to be
   a lower source given the fact that the patient had bright red blood in
   her stools for 4 days and is relatively hemodynamically stable.  If
   bleeding was from an upper source she would likely be less stable
   and/or have melanotic stools.  Possible sources of GI bleed include:
   hemorrhoids and/or rectal fissure (usually not the cause of such
   dramatic Hct drops, but possible if going on for 4 days),
   Diverticulosis and AVM (patient does not fit the typical demographic
   that is at risk for these conditions, but remains possible), malignancy
   (patient recently reports having trouble gaining weight and has
   recently diagnosed pancreatic mass), colitis (UC, infectious or
   ischemic - patient does not have a hx of UC, she has been Afebrile,
   making an infectious eitology less likely. She does not have the
   diffuse pain expected with ischemic colitis, but her lactate was
   increased).
   - PPI IV BID.
   - Tranfuse PRBC with goal Hct of 25-30.  Repeat Hct in low 20's
   - check Hct q 4-6 hrs around transfusions & check Coags and plts q 12
   hrs.
   - Give 1 unit of FFP for every 6 of PRBCs.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal >25,000
   - consider Red tag scan & angiography if patient appears to be actively
   bleeding; seems to have subsided currently as pt is having brown BM's
   w/o gross blood.
   - GI pending.
   - Will keep NPO for possible procedure in AM.
   #Hypotension - currently stable; will follow
   #Anemia: Baseline high 20s-low 30s.  GI bleed caused a severe drop in
   Hct.
   -monitor Hct q 6hrs (around transfusions)
   -Transfuse for Hct goal of 25-30
   #EtOH abuse: patient reports that last drink was 2 days ago. no s/s of

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis, and a recent pancreatic mass. She presented with a severe gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, characterized by bloody stools and a drop in hematocrit levels. The source of bleeding is suspected to be lower in the GI tract, possibly due to hemorrhoids, rectal fissure, diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), malignancy, or colitis. 

The patient has been receiving packed red blood cell transfusions and intravenous pantoprazole to control the bleeding. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but her hemodynamic status requires close monitoring. The plan includes monitoring the hematocrit levels frequently, repeating blood transfusions to maintain a target hematocrit range of 25-30%, and checking coagulation parameters every 12 hours. Platelet transfusion is considered if the platelet count falls below 25,000. If the patient continues to bleed, further diagnostic procedures such as a red tag scan and angiography may be necessary. 

The patient also has a history of hypertension, for which she normally takes Lisinopril. However, this medication will be held until her hematocrit and hemodynamic status stabilize. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU overnight for hemodynamic stability and frequent hematocrit checks."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease, ethanol abuse, and a recently identified pancreatic mass associated with gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells and has stable hemoglobin levels. The initial upper gastrointestinal endoscopy did not reveal any significant findings, suggesting a lower gastrointestinal source for the bleed. The differential diagnosis includes diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), malignancy, hemorrhoids, and infectious or ischemic colitis. A colonoscopy has been planned to investigate further. The patient also has a suspected pancreatic mass, which is highly suggestive of malignancy based on recent imaging. Consultation with gastroenterology and surgery has been recommended for additional imaging, biopsy, and management. The patient's other medical issues include alcohol abuse, hypertension, and depression/anxiety. She will receive prophylactic treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and venodynes. The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, and she is expected to be transferred to the gastrointestinal suite for a colonoscopy before being transferred back to a floor bed."

   #GI Bleed: Severe GI bleed according to drop in Hct. The patient is
   fairly hemodynamically stable for such a large blood loss.  Seems to be
   a lower source given the fact that the patient had bright red blood in
   her stools for 4 days and is relatively hemodynamically stable.  If
   bleeding was from an upper source she would likely be less stable
   and/or have melanotic stools.  Possible sources of GI bleed include:
   hemorrhoids and/or rectal fissure (usually not the cause of such
   dramatic Hct drops, but possible if going on for 4 days),
   Diverticulosis and AVM (patient does not fit the typical demographic
   that is at risk for these conditions, but remains possible), malignancy
   (patient recently reports having trouble gaining weight and has
   recently diagnosed pancreatic mass), colitis (UC, infectious or
   ischemic - patient does not have a hx of UC, she has been Afebrile,
   making an infectious eitology less likely. She does not have the
   diffuse pain expected with ischemic colitis, but her lactate was
   increased).
   - PPI IV BID.
   - Tranfuse PRBC with goal Hct of 25-30.  Repeat Hct in low 20's
   - check Hct q 4 hrs around transfusions & check Coags and plts q 12
   hrs.
   - Give 1 unit of FFP for every 6 of PRBCs.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal >25,000
   - consider Red tag scan & angiography if patient appears to be actively
   bleeding; seems to have subsided currently as pt is having brown BM's
   w/o gross blood.

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), ethanol abuse, and a recently identified pancreatic mass associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has experienced a severe GI bleed, as indicated by the significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). She is currently hemodynamically stable, with vital signs within normal limits, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.

The potential complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: Despite being currently stable, the patient's drop in Hct indicates significant blood loss. If she experiences further bleeding or if her blood pressure and heart rate deteriorate, she may become hemodynamically unstable, requiring urgent intervention.

2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the recent GI bleed and ongoing hospitalization. This increases the risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

3. Ethanol withdrawal: Although the patient reports her last drink was two days ago and she does not currently exhibit signs of acute withdrawal, monitoring for ethanol withdrawal symptoms is essential, especially if her condition worsens or if she experiences prolonged periods without alcohol intake.

4. Anemia: The patient's baseline anemia needs to be managed appropriately. Close monitoring of Hct levels and timely transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) will be necessary to maintain the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), alcohol abuse, and a recently identified pancreatic mass associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has been experiencing bright red blood in her stools for four days and has a severe drop in hematocrit (Hct) indicating significant blood loss. However, she remains hemodynamically stable. Possible sources of GI bleeding include hemorrhoids and/or rectal fissure, diverticulosis and arteriovenous malformation (AVM), malignancy, and colitis. 

The patient is currently receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, and plans are in place for blood transfusion with a target Hct of 25-30%. Coagulation studies and platelet counts will be monitored every 12 hours. If the patient shows signs of active bleeding, a red tag scan and angiography may be considered. The patient is being kept NPO (nothing by mouth) at this time.

Other medical issues include anemia, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and depression/anxiety. The patient's outpatient medications need to be confirmed, including citalopram for depression and lorazepam for anxiety. The patient's blood pressure medication, lisinopril, is being held due to the GI bleed. Prophylactic measures such as pneumo boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis are being implemented.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female admitted to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and a pancreatic mass. The source of the GIB remains undefined, and she is awaiting lower endoscopy evaluation. The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and has had stability in hematocrit levels. She is currently on PPI (proton pump inhibitor) and has two peripheral IV lines in place. There is a concern for coagulopathy and the primary source of bleeding will be determined based on colonoscopy findings. The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hypertension. Her current vital signs are within normal range. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, platelet count, troponin T level, and glucose level. However, there is a slightly elevated creatinine level. The patient's review of systems is positive for nausea and mild epigastric discomfort. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient's ongoing bleeding and the use of anticoagulants in the ICU may increase the risk of coagulopathy. Monitoring coagulation parameters and adjusting medication as necessary is crucial.
2. Infection: Prolonged use of invasive lines and exposure to the ICU environment can increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid intake"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease, alcohol abuse, and a recently identified pancreatic mass associated with gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which did not reveal the source of bleeding. The most likely source of bleeding is thought to be from the lower gastrointestinal tract, with possible causes including diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformation, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, hemorrhoids, or infectious/ischemic colitis. The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells and is currently hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient may continue to experience bleeding from the unidentified source in the lower gastrointestinal tract, leading to further blood loss and potential hemodynamic instability.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to alcohol abuse and the ongoing bleeding, making them susceptible to infections.
3. Pancreatic mass progression: The pancreatic mass is suspected to be malignant based on recent imaging. If left untreated, it could progress and lead to further complications.
4. Thromboembolic events: Due to immobilization and potential hypercoagulability state, the patient is at an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
5. Alcohol withdrawal: Although the patient denies any symptoms of acute withdrawal, it is important to monitor for signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, especially considering her history"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), alcohol abuse, and a recently identified pancreatic mass associated with gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and grade 1 internal and external hemorrhoids. Other findings from the colonoscopy included esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction, Schatzki's ring, erosions in the antrum, erythema and edema in the duodenal bulb, normal second part of the duodenum, and a diverticulum in the second part of the duodenum.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed): The patient has a history of GI bleed, and the recent colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis, which is a known cause of lower GI bleeding. The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and is currently stable. However, ongoing monitoring of hemoglobin levels and potential transfusion may be required.
2. Pancreatic mass: The patient has a pancreatic mass, and malignancy is suspected based on recent imaging. Further evaluation, including additional imaging and biopsy, is planned to determine the nature of the mass and appropriate management.
3. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and it is important"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease, ethanol abuse, and a recently identified pancreatic mass associated with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She underwent a colonoscopy which revealed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and internal and external hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated a regular diet last night and denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or hematochezia/melena. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/72 to 135/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has been receiving various medications including lorazepam, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors. She also has a Schatzki's ring, esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction, erosions in the antrum, erythema and edema in the duodenal bulb, and a diverticulum in the second part of the duodenum. Her blood counts are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated white blood cell count. The patient's pancreatic mass is suspected to be malignant based on recent imaging, and further evaluation through endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and biopsy is planned. The patient is also being treated for ethanol abuse, hypertension, anxiety, and prophylaxis for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis. She is expected to be stable"
