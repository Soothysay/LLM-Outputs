   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   66 year old female h/o SMLC metastatic to brain and liver (s/p whole
   brain XRT, one cycle of palliative etoposide and cisplatin) with dark
   blood per rectum for four days.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient describes dark blood mixed with
   stool without melena.  Differential diagnosis includes lower
   gastrointestinal bleeding versus brisk upper GI bleed which seems
   unlikely given hemodynamic stability.  NG lavage not performed in ER
   secondary to thrombocytopenia and given stability will defer for now.
   In terms of lower gastrointestinal sources, could represent bleeding
   AVM in the setting of thrombocytopenia vs mucosal damage secondary to
   chemotherapy vs diverticulosis vs. others. For now will maintain IV
   access with two large bore peripheral IVs.  Although low suspicion for
   upper GI source will continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  She has now received one
   unit of platelets and will receive two units of blood overnight.  If
   bleeding has ceased may defer further workup given known metastatic
   cancer and thrombocytopenia.  If persistent bleeding would need to
   persue endoscopic evaluation vs. tagged red blood cell scan if bleeding
   becomes more brisk.
   - two large bore IVs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - NPO in case requires endoscopic procedure
   - two units of blood overnight
   - IVF boluses for MAPs < 65 or UOP < 50 cc/hr
   - holding home antihypertensives currently
   Thrombocytopenia: Patient has had worsening thrombocytopenia over the
   past month thought to be secondary to her chemotherapy.  Also concern
   for medication induced cause which prompted recent switch from dilantin
   to keppra.  She is not receiving heparin products currently and
   recently had negative HIT workup.  Concern that she may also have
   marrow involvement of her malignancy.
   - repeat platelet count post-transfusion
   - goal > 20
   - will need to consider bone marrow biopsy if no improvement
   Leukocytosis:  Likely secondary to dexamethasone.  No signs or symptoms
   of infection at present.
   - culture if spikes
   - no antibiotics
   - trend white blood cell count
   Small Cell Lung Cancer:  As above with known metastases to brain and
   liver diagnosed in [**2110-10-29**] s/p whole brain XRT and 1 cycle of
   palliative chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin.  She was
   scheduled to receive a second round of chemotherapy this week but this
   was deferred secondary to her thrombocytopenia.
   - oncology will see today
   - continue dexamethasone 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in the setting of known brain
   metastases
   Anxiety: Stable.
   - continue alprazolam QHS:PRN
   Hypertension:
   - holding home antihypertensives
   Hyperglycemia: Glucose on chem 7 in ER elevated at 207.  Likely
   secondary to dexamethasone.
   - insulin sliding scale while in ICU
   FEN: NPO for now, monitor electrolytes, IVF boluses for MAP < 65, UOP <
   50 cc/hr
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, pantoprazole

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain and liver. She has been admitted to the ICU due to dark red blood per rectum for four days. The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and platelets overnight. She is hemodynamically stable, with vital signs including a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/80 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals pale conjunctiva, moist mucous membranes, supple neck, regular heart rhythm without murmurs, decreased breath sounds throughout the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen with positive bowel sounds, and petichae on the dorsal hands and feet bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be alert and oriented, with intact sensation to light touch, but with weakness in the upper and lower extremities on the left side.

The patient's laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and hyperglycemia. The assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, small cell lung cancer, anxiety, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, pale conjunctiva, and no signs of edema or cyanosis. Neurologic examination shows the patient attentive and oriented to person, place, and time. Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 29 K/uL, and elevated white blood cell count at 18.3.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Further investigation is required to determine the source of the bleeding. An upper endoscopy has been scheduled to evaluate for upper GI bleeding. If negative, a tagged RBC scan will be performed to assess for ongoing lower GI bleeding. The patient is being transfused with additional fluids as needed. Pre-renal azotemia is present, and platelet counts will be monitored. Considering the suspicion of marrow involvement, heme-onc has been checked, and the patient has tested negative for HIT antibody. The patient is hemodynamically stable and will continue to receive ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, prophylaxis for stress ulcers, and prevention of deep vein thrombosis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of malignancy and currently admitted to the ICU. She has a recent diagnosis of duodenitis without signs of bleeding. The patient's tagged RBC scan was negative, indicating no active gastrointestinal bleeding. However, her condition has progressed with metastatic disease in the liver, increased size of the dominant pulmonary nodule, right hilar node, and new mediastinal node. The patient is undergoing bowel preparation for a planned colonoscopy and is scheduled to be transferred to the floor. She has been experiencing roughly one bowel movement per hour since starting the prep but has not cleared. Her platelet count is low, and she received a transfusion of platelets. She is also showing signs of dehydration, so IV fluids were given. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range. The patient is currently on respiratory support with oxygen delivery, but her ABG results are within normal limits. The physical examination findings are incomplete due to assessment not being performed. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is still in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's cancer condition, further progression of metastatic disease, gastrointestinal bleeding despite the negative tagged RBC scan, complications from the bowel preparation procedure, dehydration, and potential infections due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy or malignancy."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of cancer, specifically malignant neoplasm of the lung. She was admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding, which is now under control. The patient has been experiencing a progression of metastatic disease within the liver, an increased size of a dominant pulmonary nodule, and a new mediastinal node consistent with disease progression. She also has duodenitis but no signs of bleeding. The patient has been receiving bowel preparation for a planned colonoscopy, resulting in roughly one bowel movement per hour without clearing. Her platelet count is low, and she is showing signs of dehydration during the bowel prep. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is in acute distress. Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, rales, and rhonchi that clear with cough. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, LDH, and low magnesium level. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive metastatic disease: The patient's cancer appears to be progressing rapidly with the presence of metastases in the liver and new mediastinal nodes. This could potentially lead to further complications and deterioration of the patient's overall health condition.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although currently under control, the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding indicates a potential risk for future bleeding episodes"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 2713**] is a 66 year old female with a history of small cell lung
   cancer metastatic to brain and liver s/p whole brain XRT and one cycle
   of palliative chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin now with LGIB,
   ?TTP
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   - two large bore IVs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - NPO in case requires endoscopic procedure
   - maintain HCT close to 25
   - IVF boluses for MAPs < 65 or UOP < 50 cc/hr
   - holding home antihypertensives currently
   .
   # TTP: may have subacute TTP, likely Cisplatin induced
   - given IV Dex, cont PO Dex
   - HemOnc to review smear in AM and d/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2735**]/Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   - could have platelet abs -> Blood bank fellow to inform about tests to
   be ordered including Plt HLA abs; touchbase w/ blood bank on call in AM
   - try to maintain plts over 20
   - repeat plts in 1 hour to confirm rapid consumption
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: could be combination of chemotherapy, and now TTP.
   Also concern for medication induced cause which prompted recent switch
   from dilantin to keppra.  She is not receiving heparin products
   currently and recently had negative HIT workup.  Concern that she may
   also have marrow involvement of her malignancy.
   - management as above
   - goal > 20
   - will need to consider bone marrow biopsy
   Leukocytosis:  No signs or symptoms of infection at present.
   - culture if spikes
   - no antibiotics
   - trend white blood cell count
   Small Cell Lung Cancer:  As above with known metastases to brain and
   liver diagnosed in [**2110-10-29**] s/p whole brain XRT and 1 cycle of
   palliative chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin.  She was
   scheduled to receive a second round of chemotherapy this week but this
   was deferred secondary to her thrombocytopenia.
   - continue dexamethasone 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in the setting of known brain
   metastases
   Anxiety: Stable.
   - continue alprazolam QHS:PRN
   Hypertension:
   - holding home antihypertensives
   .
   Hyperglycemia: Glucose on chem 7 in ER elevated at 207.  Likely
   secondary to dexamethasone.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer that has metastasized to the brain and liver. She has undergone whole brain radiation therapy and one cycle of palliative chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin. The patient is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, small cell lung cancer, anxiety, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/73 to 153/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is alert and oriented, with clear lungs and no signs of edema or abnormal neurologic findings. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet counts below normal. The patient's liver enzymes and kidney function tests are within normal limits. 

The patient's current medications include IV PPI, NPO in preparation for possible endoscopic procedure, IV fluids, and medications for blood pressure and seizure prophylaxis. 

The patient's assessment and plan involve managing her gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected TTP, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, small cell lung cancer, anxiety,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of malignant neoplasm of the lung and gastrointestinal bleed. He presented with anemia and thrombocytopenia. He underwent bowel prep for a colonoscopy yesterday and had a nuclear medicine test today. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is hemodynamically stable. His platelet count remains low. He had a bone marrow biopsy today. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed and ongoing thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his compromised immune system from the malignancy and potential immunosuppressive therapy.
3. Thrombosis: Despite prophylaxis, the patient may still be at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and thrombocytopenia.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's low platelet count may indicate bone marrow suppression, which can lead"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer, which has metastasized to the brain and liver. She is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient has undergone various diagnostic procedures, including a colonoscopy and tagged red blood cell scan, to investigate the cause of GIB. Treatment plans include administering IV Dex (dexamethasone), maintaining hematocrit levels, and providing IV fluid boluses for mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65 or urine output below 50 cc/hr.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient continues to have bloody stools despite receiving treatment. There is a risk of further bleeding and potential complications such as hypotension, shock, or organ failure.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding and bruising. It may be related to chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression, TTP, or malignancy involvement of the bone marrow.
3. TTP: The patient's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of TTP, which is a rare blood disorder characterized by blood clots forming in small blood vessels throughout the body. If left untreated, TTP can lead to organ damage and potentially be life-threatening.
4. Hyperglycemia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer, which has metastasized to the brain and liver. She has been treated with whole brain radiation therapy and one cycle of palliative chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin. The patient presents with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), bloody stools, and a cecal mass observed on colonoscopy. She also has thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, anxiety, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and small cell lung cancer with known brain and liver metastases.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's ongoing bloody stools and cecal mass indicate a potential complication related to her gastrointestinal system. Further evaluation and management are needed to control the bleeding and prevent further complications.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count can lead to increased bleeding risks. It may be due to chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression or TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), possibly caused by cisplatin. Close monitoring of platelet levels and appropriate management are necessary.

3. TTP (Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura): Given the patient's symptoms and lab results, TTP should be considered as a possible diagnosis. It is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer, which has metastasized to the brain and liver. She has been treated with whole brain radiation therapy and one cycle of palliative chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin. The patient is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), suspected to be lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) based on the presence of bloody stool. A colonoscopy revealed a bleeding cecal mass, and a biopsy was taken. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/74 to 108/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is alert and oriented, with clear lungs and no evidence of abdominal pain or distress. Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated levels of LDH. The assessment and plan include management of gastrointestinal bleeding, possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, small cell lung cancer, anxiety, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to be determined.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain and liver, who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient underwent a colonoscopy which revealed a bleeding cecal mass, and a biopsy was taken. The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, and there is concern for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), medication-induced platelet dysfunction, chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, and possible bone marrow involvement by malignancy. The patient's current medications include Ativan, proton pump inhibitors, and dexamethasone. She also has leukocytosis, hypertension, anxiety, and hyperglycemia. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions.

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing bloody stool indicates an ongoing risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and organ failure if not managed promptly.
2. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): The patient's low platelet counts and neurological symptoms raise concern for TTP, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological abnormalities, renal dysfunction, and fever. Timely recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Medication-induced platelet"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, metastatic lung cancer, and a colonic mass. The patient underwent a colonoscopy yesterday, which revealed a probable tumor mass in the cecum. Biopsies were taken, and the patient experienced mild bleeding post-biopsy but did not require a blood transfusion and remained hemodynamically stable.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/84 mmHg to 119/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination revealed no acute distress, overweight/obese, no pallor, and no scleral edema. Cardiovascular examination showed a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and a systolic murmur at the base. Respiratory examination was clear with rare crackles. Abdominal examination was soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present and no rebound tenderness. Extremities showed no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. Neurologic examination was attentive, oriented, and purposeful movement.

Laboratory results showed a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 18 K/uL, platelet count of"
