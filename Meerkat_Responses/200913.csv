   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and diverticulosis. He presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding and was initially treated with aspirin and Coumadin. Despite initial stabilization, the patient experienced recurrent and severe gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to hemodynamic instability. He was evaluated by surgery and transferred to the medical ICU.

The patient underwent an endoscopy that showed active bleeding from the colon/rectum, but an interventional radiology procedure to coil the bleeding vessel was unsuccessful due to difficult access and inability to visualize the bleeding. The patient received a total of 11 units of packed red blood cells and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 139/76 to 95/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation via a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 105 K/uL, platelet count of 168 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose level of 189 mg/dL. The coagulation profile shows an elevated PT/INR of 16.7 and PTT of 30.3, likely"

   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7652**] is a 69 yo male with CAD, HL, PAF on coumadin, s/p
   CVA, hypothyroid, who is admitted for lower GI bleed localized to
   sigmoid/rectum.
   .
   1.  GI bleed.  GI bleed was localized to sigmoid colon or rectal colon
   on tagged RBC.  BP currently stable though was transiently in 70s at
   OSH and in 80s upon arrival to the MICU.  S/p 11  units PRBCs over the
   last 24 hours with ongoing GI bleeding.  EGD showed colitis with
   diverticulitis.
   - Type and Cross 4 units at all times
   - GI and surgery following tonight
   - consider angio versus repeat tagged RBC scan to look for worsening
   bleed
   - q 4 hour Hcts, goal Hct > 30 while actively bleeding
   - 3 peripherals (1 18, 2 20s)
   .
   2.  A. fib.  Was anticoagulated with coumadin though INR at OSH was
   only 1.6.  INR reversed with Vitamin K and FFP.  S/p 6 units of FFP.
   - transfuse FFP to keep INR < 1.6
   .
   2. CAD. No ischemic changes on EKG, patient denies CP.
   - hold aspirin, BB in setting of bleed
   - continue tricor
   - serial EKGs
   .
   3.  Type 2 DM.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - f/u fingersticks
   - HISS; can consider resuming NPH when diet is advanced
   .
   4.  HTN.
   - hold lisinopril, toprol, doxazosin due to low BPS in setting of bleed
   .
   5.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levoxyl

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient underwent a colonoscopy on [**2184-8-22**] and experienced some complications. They developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFRVR) and had a drop in hemoglobin levels, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's blood pressure was initially stable, but later became low. They were started on beta-blockers for their heart condition. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and allergies to Lipitor and metronidazole. They received antibiotics, midazolam, and fentanyl infusions. The patient's vital signs were mostly within normal range, except for an elevated heart rate during the AF episode. Fluid balance showed a negative balance of 1,628 mL. The patient's respiratory support included oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and their ABG results were within normal limits. Physical examination findings were not assessed in several areas. Lab results indicated anemia, elevated glucose levels, and slightly abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging studies are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's evidence of colitis and diverticulosis, along with the drop in hemoglobin levels, suggests ongoing or recent gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to hypotension and require blood transfusions.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFRVR): The patient's initial presentation of AF may progress to persistent or permanent AF, increasing"

","The patient's chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding, which was initially suspected due to hematochezia and bradypnea but later confirmed by colonoscopy. The patient underwent an EKG and serial HCTs, which showed a drop in hemoglobin levels from 31.2 to 29, indicating significant blood loss. One unit of packed red blood cells (prbcs) was given, resulting in an increase in hemoglobin levels to 31.

The patient is currently on beta-blockers (home dose of 250mg toprol XL, started 25mg TID) for rate control, as they were found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFR). The possibility of amiodarone for rhythm control or lifelong anticoagulation due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) will be discussed on rounds tomorrow.

The patient has allergies to Lipitor (Oral) (Atorvastatin Calcium) and an intolerance to the last dose of antibiotics, Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, with a maximum recorded temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. The blood pressure is stable, ranging from 121/63 to 141/96 mmHg. The heart rate is relatively high, fluctuating between 67 and 150 beats per minute, with episodes of atrial fibrillation. Respiratory rate is within normal limits at 12 breaths"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, previous cerebrovascular accident, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted for a lower gastrointestinal bleed localized to the sigmoid/rectum. The patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells over the last 24 hours with ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed colitis with diverticulosis. The patient's blood pressure is currently stable but was transiently in the 70s at the operating room and in the 80s upon arrival to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require further intervention such as angiography or repeat tagged red blood cell scan to identify the source of the bleed.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient has received a significant amount of packed red blood cells, which could lead to dilutional anemia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and fluid balance is necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR was only 1.6 prior to the procedure, and he received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse the anticoagulation. Continuous monitoring of coagulation parameters and transfusion of FFP to keep INR below 1.6 is required.
4. Cardiac arrhythm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), atrial fibrillation (AF), hyperlipidemia (HL), previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented to the hospital with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed localized to the sigmoid/rectum. The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and received 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) over the last 24 hours due to ongoing GI bleeding. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed colitis with diverticulosis. The patient is currently on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient has ongoing GI bleeding, and there is a risk of re-bleeding despite receiving PRBCs.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been transiently low, indicating potential hypotension that may require further intervention.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics, suggesting a concern for infection, possibly related to his GI condition or other factors.
5. Fluid overload: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), atrial fibrillation (AFib), previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypothyroidism, and depression. He presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding localized to the sigmoid/rectum. The patient was found to have colitis and diverticulosis during colonoscopy. He experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and was given blood products due to a low hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 27.7. His INR was reversed with Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) over the past 24 hours and is currently stable with a Hct of 29.0. He has been prescribed ciprofloxacin and flagyl for the GI bleed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: There is a risk of rebleeding in patients with lower GI bleeding, especially if the source of bleeding has not been completely identified or treated.
2. Infection: The use of invasive procedures like colonoscopy and the administration of antibiotics may increase the risk of infection, including Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.
3. Thromboembolism: Although anticoagulation was reversed due to the GI bleed, the patient's history of atrial"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), likely lower gastrointestinal, as revealed by colonoscopy showing diverticulosis and mild colitis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 131/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and blood products as needed. 

The patient's medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and a previous episode of GIB. The patient also has a history of changes in vision 1.5 years ago, with head CT and MRI positive for cerebrovascular accident (CVA), awaiting final records. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for hyperglycemia and lymphadenopathy. Physical examination findings include no pain or discomfort, warm skin, and normal neurological examination. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (101 K/uL), slightly elevated blood glucose level (135 mg/dL), low hemoglobin (11.2 g/dL), elevated creatinine (1.1 mg/dL), and electrolyte imbalances. 

The patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies have been monitored and documented throughout the hospital course.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with intermittent atrial fibrillation, controlled with beta blockers. He has a history of allergies to Lipitor and an intolerance to Metronidazole and Ciprofloxacin. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal bleeding (hematochezia, BRBPR, GI bleed). His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/63 mmHg to 131/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,516 mL and total output of 4,640 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,124 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but not on supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, cool extremities without peripheral edema, and normal neurologic examination. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and increased creatinine levels. The patient's glucose level is elevated at 176 mg/dL. Other lab values including platelet count, electrolytes, and liver enzymes are within normal limits. The patient is being treated for gastrointestinal bleeding, diabetes mellitus type II, and receiving appropriate ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted for a lower gastrointestinal bleed localized to the sigmoid/rectum. The patient has intermittent atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled and anticoagulation is being held due to gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is on ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for gastrointestinal bleeding. There is mild evidence of colitis/diverticulitis. The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal range. His temperature is slightly elevated. He has cool extremities and no peripheral edema. The patient's laboratory results show stable hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, and platelet count. However, his creatinine and blood glucose levels are elevated. The patient's electrolyte levels are mostly within normal range, except for a low potassium level. The patient's vital signs and laboratory values have been relatively stable over the past few days, with some fluctuations in his blood pressure and glucose levels. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient was admitted for a lower GI bleed and is still receiving antibiotics. It is important to monitor his condition for any signs of recurrent bleeding.
2. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presented with life-threatening lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) likely due to diverticulosis and colitis. The patient has been receiving a course of antibiotics, specifically metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, as well as other medications such as metoprolol and pantoprazole. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/76 to 90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has not shown any signs of distress or pain.

The lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, platelet count within normal range, and elevated blood glucose levels. The renal function tests are within normal limits, and liver function tests are also within normal range.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. There are no signs of distension or tenderness. Neurological examination is not assessed.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient is still at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to diverticulosis, and anticoagulation is being held for now. The patient is also being prescribed a complete course of flagyl/cipro for a total of 10 days. For atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular"
