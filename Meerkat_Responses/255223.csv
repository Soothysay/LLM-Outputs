   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   65 yo man with h/o CAD with stent.  Presents with hiccups, dry heaves,
   vomitting for a few days.  Saw PCP, c/o dysphagia.  Admitted to OSH for
   hiccups.  EGD and barium swallow with mild reflux and hiatal hernia.
   Then could no longer swallow his own saliva and slept sleeping up.
   Developed right facial droop and tongue deviation.  MRI with only small
   vessel changes.  Myasthenia w/u started, [**Doctor First Name **]/lyme negative.  Then
   developed diplopia.  Also with periods of SOB and desaturation.
   Transferred hear to floor.  By report VC there was 1.2L.  On floor was
   hypertensive with 200/104.  Got lopressor, hydral, and nitro past.
   Neurology sees him - LP and MRI.  Wife and patient refuse LP.  Then on
   floor SOB, AMS, sat to mid 80s.  Respiratory code called.  Intubated.
   BP 250/120. HR 40s after intubation.  Settled down with propofol.
   Telemetry showed ST elevations in MICU.  ST elevations on EKG II, II, F
   and ST depressions V2-V4.  Repeat EKG with inmproved ST changes.
   Cardiac enzymes with Trop 0.07.  Overnight unable to get LP.   With
   high WBC wtih Vanco/Cefepime and acyclovir.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  Aspiration event leading to respiratory failure.
   Evidence of dysphagia before intubation.  PSV as needed
   ACS:  acute coronary syndrome, will start heparin.  Increase
   beta-blocker.  ST elevation inferiorly last night, now with evolving Q
   waves.
   Cardiology consult
   Neurologic syndrome:  evidence of cranial nerve dysfunction before
   intubation.  Meningitis less likely a cause.  Could be
   autoimmune/vasculitis or paraneoplastic,
   but no evidence of cancer.    Will check TSH and B12.  Will try to get
   LP and MRI as per neurology

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and a stent. He presented with symptoms such as hiccups, dry heaves, vomiting for a few days, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after experiencing respiratory failure.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors. Initially, he developed right facial droop and tongue deviation, which led to the suspicion of a neurological issue. An MRI showed only small vessel changes, and myasthenia gravis workup was started, with the result being negative for Lyme disease. The patient then developed diplopia (double vision) and periods of shortness of breath and desaturation.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient's blood pressure was initially uncontrolled, and he required multiple medications to manage it. He also had elevated cardiac enzymes with a Troponin level of 0.07. Telemetry showed ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF, indicating possible acute coronary syndrome. However, subsequent EKGs showed improved ST changes.

The patient underwent intubation due to respiratory distress and received mechanical ventilation. His vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate ranging from 67-88 beats per minute, blood pressure between 151/89 and 200/120 mmHg, respiratory rate of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon arrival, he was diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), specifically a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's initial vital signs included a temperature of 98.1°F, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 158/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. His physical examination revealed mild jugular venous distension, a regular heart rhythm, and normal lung sounds.

The patient's initial laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels at 0.15 ng/mL, a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 41.7 g/dL, platelet count of 248 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. His renal function was within normal limits.

The patient was promptly treated with aspirin, heparin, and nitroglycerin. He was also started on a beta-blocker and statin therapy. Serial EKGs were performed, revealing ST-segment depression in leads II, III, and aVF. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline now s/p aspiration event
   and intubation.
   # Aspiration/respiratory failure:
   -continue w/ cefepime / vanc / flagyl x 8 days
   -attempt to wean vent settings after procedure, plan for extubation in
   next 1 day or so
   -RLL collapse vs. consolidation- repeat CXR following MRI / LP
   -f/u sputum cx speciation
   # ACS: per cards NSTEMI, enzymes trending down
   -preserved EF with regional inferior hypokinesis at the basal / mid
   level
   -no further cycling of enzymes
   -medial management w/ statin, beta blocker, heparin IV, aspirin and
   plavix
   # Neurologic decline:
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue meningitis amp / acyclovir, f/u LP
 unlikely bacterial
   meningitis, taper abx regimen if LP does not reveal bacterial
   meningitis
   -MRI head
   # Leukocytosis:  probably related to recurrent aspiration at OSH. No
   evidence of UTI.
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   -Antibiotics as above
   # Hypertension: BP much improved on sedation and patient with
   significant anxiety history.  Also, may reflect ongoing brainstem
   process.
   -MRI brain
   -Autoregulation as able
   # Hyponatremia: poor po intake over last several days, likely to be
   hypovolemic hyponatremia. Given possible paraneoplastic process, can
   consider this may be SIADH.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline following an aspiration event and subsequent intubation. He has been diagnosed with aspiration respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI), and a neurological decline. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has leukocytosis, hypertension, and hyponatremia. He is currently on various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, statins, beta-blockers, heparin, aspirin, and Plavix. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or prolonged ventilation due to his compromised respiratory function.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and systemic anticoagulation with heparin increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to his neurological decline and prolonged hospital stay, increasing the risk of hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), or bloodstream infection.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, and ongoing cardiac monitoring is necessary to detect any further cardiac events.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological decline requires close monitoring, and there is a risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline now s/p aspiration event
   and intubation.
   # Aspiration/respiratory failure: per family, has had difficulty with
   secretions and airway management for days. Thick/copious secretions
   aspirated from ETT on the floor.  Has been in the hospital since
   [**2154-6-20**]. Will need coverage for aspiration pneumonia
   -Cefepime/Vanc/Flagyl
   -protected airway with intubation
   -Sputum sample for culture
   # ECG changes: ECG changes concerning for STEMI, but improved with BP
   control.  Discussed ECG with cardiology. Patient has positive CE. Will
   treat for ACS and continue to trend enzymes.  Aspirin, statin, beta
   blocker for HR goal ~60.
   -trend enzymes
   -if trend up, will anticoagulate
   # Neurologic decline: neurology following. Workup to-date has been
   negative. Patient refused LP. Has different neurologic examination than
   previous, mostly significant for loss of upgoing toes and now
   asymmetric reflexes--but in the setting of sedation/acute insult.  Per
   verbal report, unlikely myasthenia with negative aldolase. Had good VC
   earlier today at 1.8 L and NIF of 54. ? Paraneoplastic, he had CT chest
   at OSH performed, as most-likely tumor would be small cell lung cancer.
   -MRI per Neurology recommendation, focus on brainstem
   -Discuss LP with family again, may be easier procedure with
   intubation/sedation
   -Continue coverage for meningitis
low likelihood this is bacterial
   meningitis given protracted course.  Change ceftriaxone to cefepime.
   Continue acyclovir and ampicillin.
   # Leukocytosis:  probably related to recurrent aspiration at OSH. No
   evidence of UTI.
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   -Antibiotics as above
   # Hypertension: BP much improved on sedation and patient with
   significant anxiety history.  Also, may reflect ongoing brainstem
   process.
   -MRI brain
   -Autoregulation as able
   # Hyponatremia: poor po intake over last several days, likely to be
   hypovolemic hyponatremia. Given possible paraneoplastic process, can
   consider this may be SIADH.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male who has been in the hospital since [**2154-6-20**] with difficulty in managing secretions and airway.
- The patient experienced an acute neurological decline and required intubation due to an aspiration event.
- The patient's ECG showed changes concerning for STEMI, but these changes improved with blood pressure control. The patient has a positive CE and will be treated for ACS.
- The patient's neurologic examination is inconsistent and asymmetric, with loss of upgoing toes and different reflexes. The patient refused lumbar puncture.
- The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, possibly related to recurrent aspiration at OSH. No evidence of urinary tract infection.
- The patient has hypertension that may be related to ongoing brainstem process or sedation.
- The patient has hyponatremia, likely due to poor oral intake over the last several days.
- The patient's condition requires coverage for aspiration pneumonia, ECG changes, and neurological decline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of difficulty with secretions and airway management, along with the aspiration event, increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's ECG changes and positive CE indicate a possible ACS, which requires prompt treatment.
3. Meningitis: The patient's neurological decline and leukocytosis raise concerns for mening"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous left coronary stent placement. He presented with facial droop and dysphagia, and aspirated on the floor. The patient was intubated and brought to the MICU. He also had EKG changes consistent with myocardial infarction (MI).

24-hour events include a trans thoracic echo performed at 02:00 PM. The patient has allergies to eptifibatide and an unknown allergy. He received antibiotics, including Acyclovir, Cefepime, Vancomycin, Ampicillin, and Metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate 72 bpm (normal range 60-87 bpm), blood pressure 152/67 mmHg (with readings ranging from 64/41 mmHg to 158/85 mmHg), respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute (normal range 9-20 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 99%. The patient is on sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,972 mL and output of 2,686 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,286 mL. He is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 531 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 23, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O, and ABG results are available.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be thin, with PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, and warm skin without rash. Neurologic examination is incomplete due to the patient's inability to move or follow commands.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and troponin-T levels, along with elevated glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Myocardial infarction (MI): Enzymes are trending down. Heparin will be given for one more day. Continue to titrate up beta-blocker, aspirin, Plavix, and simvastatin.
2. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough): Likely aspirated in the setting of dysphagia. Will try and extubate after MRI.
3. Cranial nerve neurologic syndrome: Will review LP results and determine further need for antibiotics. Will also get MRI to further evaluate the syndrome.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a complex medical history including acute neurologic decline, aspiration event, respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI), leukocytosis, hypertension, and hyponatremia. 

The patient's recent events include lumbar puncture (LP) under fluoroscopy guidance, placement of a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. 

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure but increased heart rate and respiratory rate. The oxygen saturation level is within normal range. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support through an endotracheal tube with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and normal kidney function. Troponin-T levels are decreasing, indicating improvement in the acute coronary syndrome. 

The patient has multiple medical conditions that require ongoing management, including aspiration pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome, neurologic decline, leukocytosis, hypertension, and hyponatremia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, cardiac events such as recurrent myocardial infarction or arrhythmias, further neurological decline or infection related to the LP procedure, and electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline, now post-intubation and aspiration event. He has a history of NSTEMI, with cardiac enzymes trending down. The patient is currently sedated but responds to commands, demonstrating upgoing toes on the right and downgoing on the left, along with 3+ patellar/biceps/BR reflexes on the right and 2+ on the left.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/63 mmHg to 177/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, soft and non-tender abdomen with large ecchymosis on the abdominal wall, diminished pulses in both distal extremities, and normal neurologic assessment except for abnormal reflexes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with an acute neurologic decline. He underwent an LP under fluoroscopy and had a PICC line placed. The patient also had an MRI of the head, which showed a NSTEMI with a preserved ejection fraction and regional inferior hypokinesis at the basal/mid level. He has been on antibiotics for meningitis and has had multiple cultures drawn. The patient has been intubated due to aspiration and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has experienced an aspiration event, leading to respiratory failure and subsequent intubation. This increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Meningitis: The patient is receiving antibiotics for suspected bacterial meningitis, which could potentially lead to complications if not appropriately managed.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Neurological Decline: The patient's acute neurological decline may progress, leading to additional neurological deficits or complications.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which can be caused by various factors including poor oral intake, hypovolemia, or SIADH. If"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints are respiratory failure, progressive neuro decline, and aspiration. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and is on various medications including ASA, Plavix, low-dose beta-blocker, statin, and heparin.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/64 mmHg to 177/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, and the fluid balance indicates a total input of 4,323 mL with an output of 2,230 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 56 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 130, and respiratory rate (RR) of 13 breaths per minute.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, progressive neuro decline, and aspiration. The patient has been admitted with a history of cranial nerve palsy and aspiration pneumonia, as well as respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/64 mmHg to 177/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. 

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels, and elevated glucose levels. The platelet count is slightly low at 29 K/uL. Other lab results show normal renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and liver function tests. 

The patient has been diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is currently receiving appropriate cardiac medications. The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to the inability to protect the airway, risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and airway clearance. 

The plan includes continuing vancomycin and cefepime for aspiration"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline following an aspiration event and subsequent intubation.
- The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and a neurological decline.
- The patient's leukocytosis is improving, and he is being treated with antibiotics for infection.
- The patient's hypertension has improved while under sedation.
- The patient is also experiencing hyponatremia, which is believed to be hypovolemic due to poor oral intake over the last several days. It is also possible that it could be secondary to a paraneoplastic process such as Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH).
- The patient is receiving various medications, including cefepime, vancomycin, acyclovir, heparin, aspirin, Plavix, a statin, and a beta-blocker.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/54 to 171/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient is receiving aggressive suctioning, weaning of vent settings, and diuresis with a goal of input/output negative 500cc to negative 1 liter.
- Further follow-up is planned for neurologic recommendations, MRI head, final LP studies, and sputum culture.
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory distress and may require additional interventions such as broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient has been diagnosed with ACS, specifically NSTEMI. This condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
3. Neurological decline: The patient's acute neurological decline could be due to various causes such as stroke, encephalitis, or central nervous system infection. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause and guide treatment.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and positive serologies indicate an ongoing infection. Continued surveillance and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent the progression or spread of infection.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia requires careful management to avoid complications related to electrolyte imbalance."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history includes a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. 

The patient's recent events include consultations with a neurologist and infectious disease specialist, as well as additional labs ordered. An electromyography (EMG) has also been ordered. The patient received 10 mg of IV Lasix, which resulted in a significant urine output of approximately 700 cc. After a brief period of hypotension, the patient was given 250 cc of normal saline and remains stable. The patient's ventilator settings were decreased and tolerated well, with the expectation of extubation in the morning. However, around 5 pm, the patient experienced desaturation and required suctioning.

The patient has allergies to eptifibatide and an unknown allergy. The patient's antibiotic administration includes ampicillin, metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefepime. Acyclovir was also given.

The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour and fentanyl at 100 mcg/hour. Other medications include furosemide (Lasix).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except as noted below. 

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range. The heart rate is slightly elevated but within the normal range. Blood pressure is low,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an acute neurological decline following an aspiration event and subsequent intubation. The patient has a history of ACS (acute coronary syndrome) with a diagnosis of NSTEMI, leukocytosis, hypertension, and hyponatremia. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, antiplatelet agents, and antihypertensives. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with FiO2 set at 50% and PEEP at 8 cmH2O. The patient's fluid balance shows an overall negative balance of -156 mL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced an aspiration event, leading to respiratory failure and subsequent intubation. This condition can lead to pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which may require additional antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Neurological Decline: The patient's acute neurological decline could be due to various causes such as stroke, encephalitis, or other neurological conditions. Further evaluation through imaging studies (e.g., MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid analysis is needed to determine the underlying cause and guide appropriate management.
3. Coronary Syndrome (ACS/NSTEMI): The patient has a history of ACS with NSTEMI"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man who presented with cranial nerve palsy and respiratory failure after aspiration. He has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and had one episode of desaturation that responded to suctioning. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 1040 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 29. His blood pressure is within normal limits, but his heart rate is slightly elevated. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and increased creatinine level consistent with acute renal failure. He also has electrolyte imbalances, including hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. The patient's recent medical history includes aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should monitor for any signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory symptoms.

2. Barotrauma: The high levels of positive pressure during mechanical ventilation can"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with acute neurological decline and was intubated due to an aspiration event. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI), and leukocytosis. The patient's condition is complicated by hypertension, hyponatremia, and possible early demyelinating polyneuropathy based on EMG findings. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the aspiration event and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.

2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient has been diagnosed with ACS, specifically non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). It is important to manage the patient's cardiac status with appropriate medications like antiplatelet agents (ASA, Plavix), statins, and beta-blockers to prevent further cardiac events.

3. Neurological decline: The patient's neurological decline requires further evaluation with additional neurologic consultations, follow-up imaging (MRI head), and final lumbar puncture (LP) studies. The underlying cause of the neurological decline needs to be identified and managed appropriately.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Close monitoring of the patient's blood counts and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has a history of anxiety, grieving, acute renal failure, and acute myocardial infarction. There is a concern for airway protection due to altered gag reflex and risk of aspiration. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and troponin-T levels. The patient is receiving IVIG, scopolamine, midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and other medications. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive total input with a significant output through urine. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation with set tidal volume and respiratory rate, positive end-expiratory pressure, and fraction of inspired oxygen.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: Due to the patient being intubated and on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction or failure. This can lead to further deterioration of kidney function and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T levels are elevated, suggesting myocardial injury. There is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythm"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition appears to be critical with multiple medical complications. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several concerning symptoms.

1. Neurological issues: The patient has early demyelinating polyneuropathy, with worsening L-sided facial weakness and R-sided hyperreflexia. There is also a mention of frequent apneic episodes, although ABG improved.

2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have significantly increased from 1.9 to 3.1 over 24 hours, indicating acute renal failure.

3. Myocardial infarction: The patient may have experienced a heart attack, as indicated by elevated troponin-T levels and changes in vital signs.

4. Airway compromise: The patient has an inability to protect their airway, putting them at risk for aspiration. This could be related to their neurological condition and sedation.

5. Grieving and anxiety: The patient is described as anxious and grieving, which could be due to their current medical condition and hospitalization.

6. Other lab abnormalities: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

7. Medications: The patient is on various medications including IVIG, midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and others. They have also received different antibiotics and acyclovir.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. 

In the 24-hour period, several important events occurred. Neurology recommendations included starting IVIG due to an EMG that supported early demyelinating polyneuropathy. A renal consult was also requested. Stroke recommendations did not indicate any new interventions. A post-pyloric Dobhoff tube was placed, but it was not flushed by the RN. Baclofen and acyclovir were discontinued. The patient's creatinine levels increased from 1.9 to 2.6 to 3.1 over the 24 hours, indicating worsening renal function. Scopolamine was started for secretions. Urine electrolytes suggested an intrarenal cause of acute renal failure. Additional Ig levels were ordered. The patient experienced frequent apneic episodes, but ABG improved. A stat head CT was performed to evaluate right-sided hyperreflexia, which worsened, along with left-sided facial weakness and left-sided ""shaking."" The patient's condition showed no change on a wet read.

The patient has allergies to eptifibatide and unknown medications. Antibiotics were administered at different times during the 24-hour period. The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions, as well as heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline following an aspiration event and subsequent intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration/respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and leukocytosis. Additionally, the patient has experienced worsening renal function, hyponatremia, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's aspiration event and current mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening respiratory failure.

2. Cardiac Complications: With a diagnosis of ACS/NSTEMI, the patient is at risk of developing cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial ischemia.

3. Neurologic Complications: The patient's acute neurologic decline and ongoing neurologic symptoms suggest a potential for further neurological deterioration, which could be due to stroke, encephalitis, or other central nervous system infections.

4. Renal Complications: The patient's worsening renal function indicated by the increasing creatinine levels may progress to acute kidney injury or renal failure, potentially requiring renal replacement therapy.

5. Infection-related Complications: The patient's leukocytosis and ongoing antibiotic treatment suggest an ongoing infection. There is a risk of developing secondary infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline, who has undergone intubation and is currently being treated for aspiration respiratory failure. The patient also has acute kidney injury (non-oliguric renal failure), possibly post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis, as well as acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to aspiration, further deterioration of kidney function, cardiac complications related to the NSTEMI, and neurological decline. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust treatment accordingly. Regular reassessment of the patient's neurological status through neurologic examinations and follow-up imaging studies is also necessary. Additionally, close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function parameters is crucial."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline, aspiration event, and subsequent intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), acute coronary syndrome (ACS) including a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and leukocytosis. The patient also exhibits hypertension and hyponatremia which have since resolved.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the aspiration event, the patient is at risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. This can be a serious infection in the lungs caused by bacteria or fungi present in the mouth or stomach.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to non-oliguric renal failure. This condition may progress to AKI, which can have various causes such as sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic drugs.

3. Cardiac complications: Given the diagnosis of NSTEMI, the patient is at risk of developing further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

4. Nosocomial pneumonia: Being intubated and sedated, the patient is at increased risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia, a type of pneumonia that occurs 48 hours or more after admission to the hospital.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Imm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline following an aspiration event and intubation. He remains intubated for airway protection due to significant oral and lower airway secretions. He is being treated with cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient also has neurologic decline, possibly due to encephalitis, and is receiving IVIG for treatment. He has acute renal failure (ARF), possibly acute tubular necrosis (ATN), with ongoing diuresis. His blood pressure is being controlled with labetalol, and he is on multiple medications for various conditions including ACS/NSTEMI, fever, and sedation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107-204 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG did not show any seizure activity, but there is concern for possible seizures due to the neurologic decline.
2. Renal failure: The patient has non-oliguric renal failure with a urine output of 250-300cc/hr, possibly secondary to ATN. Renal ultrasound was unremarkable.
3. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressures in the 220s/120s"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male who has experienced an acute neurologic decline and is currently intubated for airway protection due to aspiration. The patient's condition is critically ill and involves multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to aspiration, indicating ongoing respiratory failure.

2. Neurologic decline: The patient is showing signs of encephalopathy with a neurologic follow-up planned. There is a possibility of brainstem encephalitis, and final LP studies and other pending neuro labs are being awaited.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing non-oliguric renal failure with a urine output of 250-300cc/hr. It is suspected to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) possibly related to hypotension. Renal ultrasound has been performed, and the plan includes using IVIG cautiously, renal c/s if not improving, and goal I/O even.

4. Hypertension (HTN): The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which may be due to autonomic instability from ongoing neuro events. BP control is being managed with labetalol, and sedation is being increased with propofol.

5. Fever: The patient is febrile, and pan culture has been ordered. Broadening antibiotics if clinical worsens or becomes unstable is also planned.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurological decline, aspiration event, and intubation. He remains intubated for airway protection due to significant oral and lower airway tract secretions. He is being treated with cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's neurologic status is worsening, and he is receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for possible brainstem encephalitis. He also has acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), with ongoing neurologic event causing autonomic instability and hypertension. His fever is being investigated with cultures and broadened antibiotics if necessary. The patient had an acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and is on antiplatelet therapy, statin, beta-blocker, and has been taken off heparin. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient has concerns for seizure activity, and an EEG has been done. If the EEG shows seizure activity, antiepileptic medication may be required.
2. Renal failure: The patient has non-oliguric renal failure, possibly due to ATN. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial. Ren"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline following an aspiration event and intubation. He is currently in the ICU and remains intubated for airway protection due to aspiration. The patient has several medical complications, including acute respiratory failure (ARF), acute kidney injury (AKI), hypertension (HTN), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

24-hour events include concerns for seizure activity, renal ultrasound for ARF, fever, and labile blood pressures. Allergies include Eptifibatide, and the patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, sedatives, and other ICU medications.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, disconjugate gaze, normocephalic head, rhonchorous breath sounds, and trace edema in both extremities. Neurological examination is incomplete due to sedation and intubation.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, elevated troponin T, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. Other pending lab results are mentioned.

Imaging studies reveal no hydro in the renal ultrasound and no bleed or persistent sinus opacification in the head CT. The EEG shows encephalopathy but no seizure activity.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Aspiration/respiratory failure: The patient will remain intubated for airway protection. He is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurological decline, aspiration event, respiratory failure, autonomic instability, acute kidney injury (ARF), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), leukocytosis, hypertension, and thrush. The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. He is sedated with propofol and being treated for possible [Last Name (un)] encephalitis with IVIG. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101°F, blood pressure ranging from 108-212 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, troponin T levels, and glucose levels. The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total intake of 3,193 mL and output of 2,560 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's rhonchorous breath sounds at the right base and fever may indicate pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis ("

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute demyelinating neuropathy admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure related to aspiration. He continues to have elevated blood pressure despite medication titration and is on propofol for concern of hypertension related to agitation. The patient has copious secretions from the endotracheal tube, which decreased with anticholinergic therapy.

The patient's allergies include Eptifibatide, with unknown allergies to other medications. His last dose of antibiotics was cefepime at 03:00 AM. He is currently receiving propofol infusion at 25 mcg/Kg/min and other ICU medications.

The patient's medical and family history, review of systems, and physical examination are unchanged from admission except as noted above.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 196/106 mmHg to 129/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 200 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values are within normal range.

Imaging studies reveal right middle lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. No positive cultures were found. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Aspiration/respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection despite tolerating pressure support ventilation. He still has poor gag and cough reflexes, although secretions have decreased.
2. Neurologic decline: The patient has an acute demyelinating neuropathy/brainstem encephalitis. Neuro follow-up is planned, and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy will be given for possible encephalitis.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has non-oliguric renal failure, possibly acute tubular necrosis (ATN), with urine output of 250-300cc/hr. Renal function tests are abnormal, and a renal ultrasound was unremarkable.
4. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure may be due to autonomic instability from the ongoing neurologic event. Medications such as labetalol will be titrated, and hydralazine or another agent may be considered.
5. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient has non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He will continue on aspirin, Plavix, statin, and beta-blocker therapy.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to stay in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, and hypotension. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable with a blood pressure of 138/61 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

Over the course of his ICU stay, the patient's condition has fluctuated. He experienced an episode of fever (temperature of 101°F) and was started on empiric antibiotics. His blood cultures showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's blood pressure has been labile, requiring adjustment of his antihypertensive medications. He also developed agitation and was placed back on propofol for sedation. The patient was found to have thrush and was started on nystatin.

The patient's renal function has improved from an initial creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL to 1.9 mg/dL. His white blood cell count has increased from 14.2 K/uL to 15.8 K/uL, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient's platelet count is low at 75 K/uL, and his coagulation profile shows"

   # Aspiration/respiratory failure: likely [**2-11**] aspiration and pooling
   secretions
   -repeat sputum cx
   -hyoscamine w/o much effect, continue for now
   -maintain intubation while treating underlying cause w/ IVIG
   -renally dosed cefepime x 10 days (D1=[**6-30**])
   - hold propofol and daily wake-ups
   - start low-dose diuretic given 8L pos LOS with goal net neg for day
   # Neurologic decline: AMS persists despite IVIG
   - f/u neuro recs, will ask re: use of antipsychotic for agitation
   - f/u EEG
   - MRI later this week
   -IVIG for possible [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis to complete 5 days,
   considering plasmapheresis
   # Autonomic instability: likely secondary to neurologic problem.
   - start hydralazine q6 hours
   - increase metoprolol to QID
   - low dose diuretic as above
   # ARF: non oliguric renal failure, possibly having post ATN diuresis
   -maintain I/O net neg for day on lasix gtt above
   -UOP improving, check 5 p.m. lytes in setting of diuresis
   # ACS:  NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, plavix, statin, beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis:  stable, slightly higher , follow fever curve
   # Hypertension: related to level of sedation, given recent NSTEMI will
   use propofol for better sedation
    # Thrush: nystatin
   # Bloody secretions: Likely secondary to oral trauma in setting of
   intubation w/ dentures in place, may be coming from upper palate
   - Monitor for now but consider ENT c/s if sutures needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline who has experienced an aspiration event and subsequent intubation. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Aspiration/respiratory failure: The patient likely experienced two aspiration events, leading to respiratory failure. To manage this, repeat sputum cultures, continue bronchodilators, maintain intubation while treating the underlying cause with IVIG, administer renally dosed cefepime for 10 days, hold propofol and daily wake-ups, and start a low-dose diuretic given the patient's 8L positive output (POOS) with the goal of achieving a net negative fluid balance for the day.

2. Neurologic decline: The patient's altered mental status (AMS) persists despite IVIG treatment. Follow-up neurologic recommendations should be obtained, and consideration should be given to using antipsychotics for agitation. An EEG should be repeated, and an MRI should be conducted later this week. Additionally, complete 5 days of IVIG therapy, considering plasmapheresis.

3. Autonomic instability: The patient is likely experiencing autonomic instability, which is likely secondary to the neurologic problem. Start hydralazine every 6 hours, increase metoprolol to QID, and low-dose diuretic as above.

4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient is experiencing"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline now s/p aspiration event
   and intubation.
   # Aspiration/respiratory failure:  likely [**2-11**] aspiration and pooling
   secretions
   -hyoscamine w/o much effect, continue for now
   -maintain intubation while treating underlying cause w/ IVIG
   -renally dosed cefepime x 10 days
   - hold propofol and daily wake-ups
   # Neurologic decline:
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - MRI later this week
   -IVIG for possible [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis to complete 5 days
   # Autonomic instability: likely secondary to neurologic problem.
   - start hydralazine q6 hours
   - increase metoprolol to QID
   - consider esmolol gtt
   # ARF: non oliguric renal failure, possibly having post ATN diuresis
   -UOP improving, check 5 p.m. lytes
   -maintain I/O even
   # ACS:  NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, plavix, statin, beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis:  stable, slightly higher , follow fever curve
   # Hypertension: related to level of sedation, given recent NSTEMI will
   use propofol for better sedation
    # Thrush: nystatin

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male who has experienced an acute neurological decline following an aspiration event and subsequent intubation.
- The patient is currently sedated with propofol and on mechanical ventilation.
- There have been attempts to wean the patient off propofol, but agitation has occurred, leading to the reintroduction of propofol.
- The patient's blood pressure has been labile and is being managed with IV hydralazine and metoprolol.
- The patient has developed thrush and is being treated with nystatin.
- The patient's renal function is improving.
- Neurological assessments have not revealed any new findings.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes.
- There are concerns regarding potential complications such as aspiration pneumonia, autonomic instability, acute kidney injury, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Potential medical complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event increases the risk of developing pneumonia. This can be a serious infection that may require additional interventions like antibiotics and possibly a change in antibiotic therapy.
2. Autonomic instability: The patient's labile blood pressure indicates autonomic instability, which can lead to further complications like organ dysfunction or cardiovascular events.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is mentioned as improving, but AKI remains a concern due to the potential ongoing renal insult"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline now s/p aspiration event
   and intubation.
   # Aspiration/respiratory failure:  likely [**2-11**] aspiration and pooling
   secretions
   -hyoscamine w/o much effect, continue for now
   -maintain intubation while treating underlying cause w/ IVIG
   -renally dosed cefepime x 10 days
   - hold propofol and daily wake-ups
   # Neurologic decline:
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - MRI later this week
   -IVIG for possible [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis to complete 5 days
   # Autonomic instability: likely secondary to neurologic problem.
   - start hydralazine q6 hours
   - increase metoprolol to QID
   - consider esmolol gtt
   # ARF: non oliguric renal failure, possibly having post ATN diuresis
   -UOP improving, check 5 p.m. lytes
   -maintain I/O even
   # ACS:  NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, plavix, statin, beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis:  stable, slightly higher , follow fever curve
   # Hypertension: related to level of sedation, given recent NSTEMI will
   use propofol for better sedation
    # Thrush: nystatin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted with acute neurological decline. He underwent intubation after an aspiration event and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including aspiration respiratory failure, autonomic instability, acute kidney injury (ARF), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), leukocytosis, hypertension, and thrush.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration/Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to the aspiration event. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if secretions continue to pool in the airways.
2. Autonomic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, indicating potential autonomic instability. This could be secondary to the underlying neurological problem or other factors.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient is experiencing non-oliguric renal failure, possibly due to post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte balance is necessary.
4. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has been diagnosed with NSTEMI. Continued management with antiplatelet therapy, statins, beta-blockers, and close cardiac monitoring is crucial.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Monitoring for signs of infection or worsening fever is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with encephalitis and respiratory failure. He is febrile overnight. The patient has a history of acute renal failure, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and hypertension. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), blood pressure ranging from 169/80 mmHg to 204/125 mmHg, heart rate of 107 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 733 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH at 7.27, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) at 27 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 14.9 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) at -10.6 mEq/L. The patient's blood cultures were obtained from the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and peripheral line. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 267 K/uL, creatinine at 3.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 73 mg/dL, glucose at 202 mg/dL, and troponin-T at 0.07 ng/mL. The patient's medications include cefepime, propofol, heparin sodium, hydralazine, lopressor, plavix, aspirin, simvastatin, atrovent, SSI, docusate, chlorhexidine, thiamine, heparin, and hyoscyanamine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition requiring mechanical ventilation. The limitation to extubation is due to mental status and the inability to control airway and secretions.
2. Encephalitis: The patient has encephalitis, which is an inflammation of the brain. This can lead to altered mental status, confusion, and potential neurological complications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which is characterized by a sudden loss of kidney function. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and the buildup of waste products in the body.
4. Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack): The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction, which can result in cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and further damage to the heart muscle.
5. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient is febrile and has an elevated white blood cell"

   EEG
   Abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized and mildly
   slow background throughout. This suggests a widespread encephalopathy.
   Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most
   common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing (although
   encephalopathies can mask focal findings). There were no epileptiform
   features.
   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline now s/p aspiration event
   and intubation.
   # Aspiration/respiratory failure: likely [**2-11**] aspiration and pooling
   secretions
   -repeat sputum cx also contaminated; consider bronch for better sample
   -hyoscamine w/ limited effect on secretions but continue for now
   -maintain intubation while treating underlying cause w/ IVIG
   -renally dosed cefepime x 10 days (D1=[**6-30**])
   - hold propofol and daily wake-ups
   - start low-dose diuretic given 8L pos LOS with goal net neg for day
   # Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. ? [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite
   IVIG.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - family mtg to discuss repeat LP today to include flow cytometry and
   cytology
   - complete 5-day course of IVIG and monitor for improvement with no
   plan for additional therapy with steroids or plasmapheresis at this
   time
   - haldol prn for agitation
   # Autonomic instability: likely secondary to neurologic problem.
   - hydralazine q6 hours
   - metoprolol QID, uptitrate as needed
   - low dose diuretic as above
   # ARF: non oliguric renal failure, possibly having post ATN diuresis
   -maintain I/O net neg for day on lasix gtt above
   -UOP improving, check 5 p.m. lytes in setting of diuresis
   # ACS:  NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, plavix, statin, beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis:  stable, slightly higher , follow fever curve
   # Hypertension: related to level of sedation, given recent NSTEMI will
   use propofol for better sedation
    # Thrush: nystatin
   # Bloody secretions: Likely secondary to oral trauma in setting of
   intubation w/ dentures in place, may be coming from upper palate
   - Monitor for now but consider ENT c/s if sutures needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline, intubated after an aspiration event. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and is being treated with IVIG, cefepime, and diuretics. The patient also has autonomic instability, possibly due to the neurological problem, and is on hydralazine and metoprolol for blood pressure control. He has acute kidney injury and is receiving lasix for diuresis. The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is on antiplatelet therapy, statin, beta-blocker, and aspirin. There is leukocytosis, which is being monitored, and the patient has hypertension related to sedation. He has thrush and bloody secretions, which are being managed accordingly. The patient's EEG shows widespread encephalopathy without epileptiform features. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and repeat LP with flow cytometry and cytology is planned. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged intubation and ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure may require prolonged mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, and muscle weakness.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infection, and urinary tract infection due to the invasive procedures and immobility.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall individual with an unknown weight. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system examination reveals rhonchi at the right base.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate (HR) of 105 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 152/64 mmHg to 85/38 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia with a widely split S2.

The patient has received several medications including propofol, famotidine, furosemide (Lasix), hydralazine, and vancomycin. They also have multiple IV lines, including a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate, and troponin-T levels. The arterial blood gas ("

   -IVIG for possible [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis to complete 5 days,
   considering plasmapheresis
   # Autonomic instability: likely secondary to neurologic problem.
   - start hydralazine q6 hours
   - increase metoprolol to QID
   - low dose diuretic as above
   # ARF: non oliguric renal failure, possibly having post ATN diuresis

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurologic decline who has experienced an aspiration event and is currently intubated. The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Aspiration/respiratory failure: The patient likely aspirated and developed respiratory failure, which necessitated intubation. The plan is to maintain intubation while treating the underlying cause with IVIG and cefepime.

2. Neurologic decline: The patient's altered mental status persists despite receiving IVIG. Further neurologic recommendations include following up with neurology, considering the use of antipsychotics for agitation, conducting an EEG, and performing an MRI later this week. Continuing IVIG for possible encephalitis is also planned, with the possibility of adding plasmapheresis.

3. Autonomic instability: The patient's autonomic instability is likely secondary to the neurologic problem. The treatment involves starting hydralazine every 6 hours, increasing metoprolol to QID, and using low-dose diuretics.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has non-oliguric renal failure, possibly having post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis. The plan is to maintain a negative fluid balance for the day on lasix and monitor urine output.

5. Acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI): The patient has a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide any history. 

24-hour events:
- The patient was seen by neurology who recommended repeating a lumbar puncture (LP) to send for flow cytometry and cytology. The recent procedure needed to be done by interventional radiology (IR).
- Social worker (SW) involved, spoke to the wife who will come in for a family meeting tomorrow.
- Neurology recommendations do not include additional therapy such as steroids or plasmapheresis. The patient will wait for improvement with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
- Started on low-dose haloperidol.
- Received lasix 10 mg IV x 1.
- Started on famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- Blood pressures in the 80s on the new antihypertensive regimen. Decreased hydralazine back to 10 mg IV Q6H and 75 mg QID of metoprolol with persistent hypotension, so blood pressure medications are currently being held.
- Started on vancomycin for [**1-13**] positive blood cultures from [**7-6**] with gram-positive cocci in clusters from the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

   EEG
   Abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized and mildly
   slow background throughout. This suggests a widespread encephalopathy.
   Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most
   common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing (although
   encephalopathies can mask focal findings). There were no epileptiform
   features.
   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline now s/p aspiration event
   and intubation.
   # Aspiration/respiratory failure: likely [**2-11**] aspiration and pooling
   secretions
   -repeat sputum cx also contaminated; consider bronch for better sample
   -hyoscamine w/ limited effect on secretions but continue for now
   -maintain intubation while treating underlying cause w/ IVIG
   -renally dosed cefepime x 10 days (D1=[**6-30**])
   - hold propofol and daily wake-ups
   - start low-dose diuretic given 8L pos LOS with goal net neg for day
   - Family meeting today for ? trach
   # Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. ? [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite
   IVIG.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - family mtg to discuss repeat LP today to include flow cytometry and
   cytology
   - complete 5-day course of IVIG and monitor for improvement with no
   plan for additional therapy with steroids or plasmapheresis at this
   time
   - haldol prn for agitation
   # Autonomic instability/Hypertension: likely secondary to neurologic
   problem.  Seems to drop UOP with lablile BPs and Hypotension with
   scheduled hydral and metoprolol
   - change hydralazine PRN
   - Change metoprolol to 50mg QID
   - treat systolic of 180
   # ARF: non oliguric renal failure. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] likely related to
   blood pressure, but clearly not continuously improving.
   -maintain I/O even to net neg
   - renal consult today
   - PM lytes
   -UOP improving with increasing BP
   # ACS:  NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, plavix, statin, beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis:  stable, slightly higher , follow fever curve
   # Thrush: nystatin
   # Bloody secretions: Likely secondary to oral trauma in setting of
   intubation w/ dentures in place, may be coming from upper palate
   - repeat PM Hct
   - Monitor for now but consider ENT c/s if sutures needed

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline following an aspiration event and subsequent intubation. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide history. The patient's condition includes aspiration/respiratory failure, neurologic decline, autonomic instability/hypertension, acute kidney injury, acute coronary syndrome, leukocytosis, thrush, and bloody secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration/Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory complications due to the initial aspiration event. There is a need for careful monitoring and management of secretions.

2. Neurologic Decline: The patient's widespread encephalopathy suggests an underlying neurological condition. Further evaluation with repeat LP, including flow cytometry and cytology, is recommended. Monitoring for improvement with IVIG is ongoing, and additional therapy with steroids or plasmapheresis may be considered if there is no response.

3. Autonomic Instability/Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations indicate possible autonomic dysfunction secondary to neurologic problems. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure levels.

4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient is experiencing non-oliguric renal failure, which may be related to blood pressure instability. Renal consultation is recommended for further evaluation and management.

5. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has a history of N"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with demyelinating polyneuropathy. The patient experienced some heat-related events overnight. The patient has multiple allergies, including eptifibatide, and is currently receiving various medications such as propofol, famotidine, furosemide, hydralazine, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit), blood pressure ranging from 137/49 mmHg to 162/80 mmHg, heart rate between 82-109 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 680 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%. The respiratory system compliance index is 118, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood is 27.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is thin, has pupils equal and reactive to light, normal heart sounds, absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, warm skin without rash, and no neurologic response or movement assessed. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, potassium levels, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to [Last Name (un)] encephalitis. He is currently intubated due to an aspiration event and is being treated for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's recent chest X-rays show increasing opacification in the right lung base, which may be due to aspiration or pneumonia.

The patient has been febrile and on cefepime since [2154-7-5] for presumed aspiration pneumonia. The plan is to discontinue cefepime today. The patient's respiratory status has improved without significantly increased secretions, and he is currently on pressure support [8-14]. Daily wakeups and RSBI (respiratory system assessment) will be attempted today.

The patient's fevers are unclear in etiology but continue to spike daily for the past three days. Initially, there was concern for a positive blood culture, but speciation revealed coag-negative staphylococcus. Antibiotics have been held since the organism is not a typical pathogen.

The patient's neurologic decline persists despite IVIG, and an EEG shows widespread encephalopathy without epileptiform features. [Last Name (un)] encephalitis is suspected. A family meeting has been scheduled to discuss repeating LP (lumbar puncture) today to include flow cytometry and cytology. The patient will complete a 5-day course of IVIG and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline due to suspected [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. He has been intubated after an aspiration event and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been febrile and has shown signs of respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. There are opacifications in the right lung base and a small left pleural effusion on chest X-ray. Blood cultures have grown coag-negative staph, which may indicate a hospital-acquired infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, as indicated by his need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows opacifications in the right lung base, which could be indicative of pneumonia. This increases the risk of worsening lung infection and sepsis.

3. Neurologic Decline: The patient's encephalitis has resulted in a significant neurologic decline. There is a risk of continued deterioration in mental status and motor function.

4. Autonomic Instability: The patient exhibits signs of autonomic instability, including fluctuating blood pressures and urine output. This can lead to complications such as hypotension, hypertension, and renal dysfunction.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised,"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis  now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions although recent chest xrays actually
   appear worse with increasing opacification the right lower lobe.
   Continues to be febrile.  Has been on cefepime since [**2154-7-5**] for
   presumed aspiration pneumonia with plan to d/c today. Currently doing
   well from a respiratory perspective without significantly increased
   secretions.  Currently on pressure support [**8-14**].  Will attempt daily
   wakeup and RSBI today.
   - ? antibiotics
   - repeat sputum culture
   - continue hyoscamine
   - RSBI today
   - daily wakeups
   - currently making good urine and with acute renal failure so will hold
   on further diuresis
   - plan for tracheostomy and PEG placement this week secondary to poor
   neurologic status
   Fevers: Unclear etiology.  Continues to spike fevers daily for the past
   three days.  Initially concern for positive blood culture but
   speciation reveals coag negative staph and now off all antibiotics.
   Most likely etiology is pneumonia given the appearance of his chest
   xray.  Urine and blood cultures negative to date.  No recent stool
   cultures sent.  Drug fever (likely from cefepime) also considered in
   the differential.  [**Month (only) 51**] also have fevers from autonomic instability but
   this should be a diagnosis of exclusion.
   - ? antibiotics.
   - resend c. diff
   - follow cultures
   - LP today
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite IVIG.  Currently
   withdraws to painful stimuli in the legs but not  in the arms.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - plan for repeat LP today to include flow cytometry and cytology
   - now has completed a 5 day course of IVIG with no significant
   improvement noted at present
   - now also receiving high dose steroids
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Autonomic instability/Hypertension: likely secondary to neurologic
   disease.  Seems to drop UOP with lablile BPs and hypotension.  Urine
   output improved overnight with improved hypotension.
   - continue hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID
   - treat systolic of 180
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today, also with improved
   urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating blood
   pressures.  Renal consulted yesterday.
   - more liberal blood pressure management
   - renal consult pending
   -UOP improving with increasing BP
   - renally dose medications, trend creatinine
   ACS:  NSTEMI

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, fevers of unknown origin, autonomic instability/hypertension, acute renal failure, a history of NSTEMI, leukocytosis, and thrush. The patient's medical team is considering tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to poor neurological status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event has led to pneumonia, which may worsen if proper precautions are not taken to prevent further aspiration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently supported by mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator might be challenging due to his neurological condition.
3. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient continues to have fevers despite being off all antibiotics. This could indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying cause such as drug fever.
4. Autonomic instability/hypertension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressures and urine output suggest autonomic dysfunction, which can complicate his overall management.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and careful management of fluid balance and blood pressure is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions although recent chest xrays actually
   appear worse with increasing opacification the right lower lobe.
   Continues to be febrile.  Has been on cefepime since [**2154-7-5**] for
   presumed aspiration pneumonia with plan to d/c today. Currently doing
   well from a respiratory perspective without significantly increased
   secretions.  Currently on pressure support [**8-14**].  Will attempt daily
   wakeup and RSBI today.
   - D/c abx today
   - repeat sputum culture
   - d/c hyoscamine as not effective
   - RSBI today
   - daily wakeups
   - currently making good urine and with acute renal failure so will hold
   on further diuresis
   - plan for tracheostomy and PEG placement this week secondary to poor
   neurologic status
   Fevers: Unclear etiology.  Continues to spike fevers daily for the past
   three days.  Initially concern for positive blood culture but
   speciation reveals coag negative staph and now off all antibiotics.
   Most likely etiology is pneumonia given the appearance of his chest
   xray.  Urine and blood cultures negative to date.  No recent stool
   cultures sent.  Drug fever (likely from cefepime) also considered in
   the differential.  [**Month (only) 51**] also have fevers from autonomic instability but
   this should be a diagnosis of exclusion. PE/DVT less likely

   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite IVIG.  Currently
   withdraws to painful stimuli in the legs but not  in the arms.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - plan for repeat LP today to include flow cytometry and cytology
   - now has completed a 5 day course of IVIG with no significant
   improvement noted at present
   - now also receiving high dose steroids x 5-day course
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Autonomic instability/Hypertension: likely secondary to neurologic
   disease.  Seems to drop UOP with lablile BPs and hypotension.  Urine
   output improved overnight with improved hypotension.
   - continue hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID
   - treat systolic of 180
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today, also with improved
   urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating blood
   pressures.  Renal consulted yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. He was intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been febrile and diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, for which he has been on cefepime since [2154-7-5]. His chest X-ray shows increased opacity in the right lung base, which may be due to aspiration or pneumonia. The left retrocardiac opacity suggests a small left pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube is positioned 2.1 cm above the carina, and the balloon is overexpanded beyond the confines of the trachea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to aspiration pneumonia and mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation, and airway management is necessary.
2. Fevers: The patient continues to spike fevers daily, which could indicate an ongoing infection or drug fever. Further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology of the fevers.
3. Autonomic Instability/Hypertension: The patient exhibits autonomic instability with labile blood pressures and hypotension. This could be secondary to neurologic disease or other underlying causes. Blood pressure management and renal function should be closely monitored.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, as"

   plan for additional therapy with steroids or plasmapheresis at this
   time
   - haldol prn for agitation
   # Autonomic instability/Hypertension: likely secondary to neurologic
   problem.  Seems to drop UOP with lablile BPs and Hypotension with
   scheduled hydral and metoprolol
   - change hydralazine PRN
   - Change metoprolol to 50mg QID
   - treat systolic of 180
   # ARF: non oliguric renal failure. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] likely related to
   blood pressure, but clearly not continuously improving.
   -maintain I/O even to net neg
   - renal consult today
   - PM lytes
   -UOP improving with increasing BP
   # ACS:  NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, plavix, statin, beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis:  stable, slightly higher , follow fever curve
   # Thrush: nystatin
   # Bloody secretions: Likely secondary to oral trauma in setting of

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline following an aspiration event and intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with encephalitis and is experiencing various medical complications. 

1. Aspiration/Respiratory Failure: The patient likely had two aspiration events, leading to respiratory failure. The current plan is to maintain intubation while treating the underlying cause with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). 

2. Neurologic Decline: The patient's neurologic decline is attributed to encephalitis. The EEG shows widespread encephalopathy without epileptiform features. Despite receiving IVIG, the patient's mental status persists. 

3. Autonomic Instability/Hypertension: The patient's autonomic instability and hypertension are likely secondary to the neurologic problem. This has resulted in labile blood pressures and episodes of hypotension. 

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient is experiencing non-oliguric renal failure. The cause is likely related to blood pressure fluctuations. 

5. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has been diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The treatment plan includes continuing aspirin, Plavix, statin, and beta-blocker medications. 

6. Leukocytosis: The patient has stable leukocytosis, which is being monitored along with the fever"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with demyelinating polyneuropathy who is currently critically ill. He is awaiting tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient has been started on steroids yesterday.

24-hour events include a positive pan culture, fever, and administration of antibiotics (Vancomycin and Cefepime). The patient is receiving propofol infusion, heparin sodium, and various other medications including ASA, Plavix, atrovent, simvastatin, SSI, colace, chlorhexidine, thiamine, hyocyamine, lopressor, protonix, medrol, and more.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 173/82 mmHg to 104/53 mmHg, heart rate of 103 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is 104.6 kg, and his height is 70 inches.

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,134 mL and output of 2,402 mL with a total positive balance of 732 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His ABG results are ///29/ with a Ve of 6.7 L/min.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, with PERRL eyes, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is not attentive, responds to commands, and moves his feet on command.

Laboratory results include WBC of 13.4, Hct of 33.0, Plt of 322, Cr of 3.3, Glucose of 290, and other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, differential, electrolytes, and more.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, for which he has completed a course of cefepime and is awaiting trach and PEG. There is suspicion of [Last Name] encephalitis, and a repeat LP is planned. Acute renal failure is present, but creatinine levels have improved with higher blood pressure. The patient is on ASA and Plavix for NSTEMI. Fever is present, but the source is unclear, and subsequent blood cultures are negative. Antibiotics will be stopped and reassessed. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions.  CXR notable for persistent
   atelectasis.  Currently on pressure support [**8-14**].  Off antibiotics.
   Long term plan for trach but unable to do so until plavix has been off
   for seven days.
   - follow sputum culture from [**2154-7-10**]
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix
   - continue daily wakeup and RSBI
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Unclear etiology.  Continues to spike fevers
   daily.  No recent positive blood cultures.  Now off antibiotics.  Urine
   and blood cultures negative to date.  C. diff pending.  Sputum culture
   from yesterday pending.  Drug fever or fever from autonomic instability
   also possible.  PE/DVT less likely although must remain in the
   differential.  Differential from yesterday with left shift although
   this may also be from high dose steroids.
   - holding antibiotics
   - resend c. diff
   - follow cultures
   - LP yesterday without evidence of infection but will follow culture
   - LENIs for ? DVT
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite IVIG.  Repeat LP
   yesterday with samples sent for cytometry and cytology.   Per
   neurology, following commands and exam improved.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - follow LP cytology and cytometry
   - continue high dose steroids day 3
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Autonomic instability/Hypertension: likely secondary to neurologic
   disease.  Seems to drop UOP with lablile BPs and hypotension.  Urine
   output improved with higher blood pressures.
   - continue hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID
   - treat systolic of 180
   Hypernatremia:  Serum sodium difficult to control despite free water
   flushes per NGT.  Urine osms 441 not decreased.
   - continue D5W and free water flushes per NGT
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today to 1.6, also with
   improved urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating
   blood pressures.
   - more liberal blood pressure management
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - UOP improving with increasing BP
   - renally dose medications, trend creatinine
   ACS:  NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, statin, beta blocker
   - d/c plavix given plans for trach
   Coffee Ground Emesis:  Patient with a single episode of coffee grounds
   noted in NGT yesterday after LP.  Hematocrit stable.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hematocrits
   - d/c plavix

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He recently experienced an aspiration event and was intubated. The patient has aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, with persistent atelectasis seen on chest X-ray. He is currently on pressure support and off antibiotics. Long-term plans include a tracheostomy after stopping Plavix for seven days.

The patient's fevers and leukocytosis remain unclear, with negative blood and urine cultures to date. C. diff is pending, along with sputum culture results. Drug fever or autonomic instability could also be possible causes. PE/DVT is less likely but still a consideration.

The patient's neurological decline is being managed with IVIG and high-dose steroids. An EEG showed widespread encephalopathy without epileptiform features, leading to a probable diagnosis of [Last Name (un)] encephalitis. Repeat LP was done with samples sent for cytometry and cytology.

The patient has autonomic instability and hypertension, which are likely secondary to neurologic disease. Hypotension and fluctuating blood pressures are being treated with hydralazine and metoprolol.

Hypernatremia is challenging to control despite free water flushes through the NG tube. Urine osmolality remains high.

Acute renal failure is suspected due to hypotension and fluctuating blood pressures. Creatinine improved to 1.6, and urine"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions although recent chest xrays actually
   appear worse with increasing opacification the right lower lobe.
   Continues to be febrile.  Has been on cefepime since [**2154-7-5**] for
   presumed aspiration pneumonia with plan to d/c today. Currently doing
   well from a respiratory perspective without significantly increased
   secretions.  Currently on pressure support [**8-14**].  Will attempt daily
   wakeup and RSBI today.
   - D/c abx today
   - repeat sputum culture
   - d/c hyoscamine as not effective
   - RSBI today
   - daily wakeups
   - currently making good urine and with acute renal failure so will hold
   on further diuresis
   - plan for tracheostomy and PEG placement this week secondary to poor
   neurologic status
   Fevers: Unclear etiology.  Continues to spike fevers daily for the past
   three days.  Initially concern for positive blood culture but
   speciation reveals coag negative staph and now off all antibiotics.
   Most likely etiology is pneumonia given the appearance of his chest
   xray.  Urine and blood cultures negative to date.  No recent stool
   cultures sent.  Drug fever (likely from cefepime) also considered in
   the differential.  [**Month (only) 51**] also have fevers from autonomic instability but
   this should be a diagnosis of exclusion. PE/DVT less likely
   - d/c cefepime today as above
   - resend c. diff
   - add on diff
   - follow cultures
   - LP today
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite IVIG.  Currently
   withdraws to painful stimuli in the legs but not  in the arms.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - plan for repeat LP today to include flow cytometry and cytology
   - now has completed a 5 day course of IVIG with no significant
   improvement noted at present
   - now also receiving high dose steroids x 5-day course
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Autonomic instability/Hypertension: likely secondary to neurologic
   disease.  Seems to drop UOP with lablile BPs and hypotension.  Urine
   output improved overnight with improved hypotension.
   - continue hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID
   - treat systolic of 180
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today, also with improved
   urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating blood
   pressures.  Renal consulted yesterday.
   - more liberal blood pressure management
   - renal consult pending
   -UOP improving with increasing BP
   - renally dose medications, trend creatinine
   ACS:  NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, plavix, statin, beta blocker
   Leukocytosis: stable, slightly higher , follow fever curve
   - Check diff
   Thrush: nystatin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to [Last Name (un)] encephalitis. The patient has been intubated due to an aspiration event. He is currently febrile and has been on cefepime for presumed aspiration pneumonia. 

The patient's respiratory status appears to be stable without significantly increased secretions. He is on pressure support [8-14] and will attempt daily wakeups and respiratory support index (RSBI) today.

The plan includes discontinuing antibiotics today, repeating sputum culture, discontinuing hyoscamine as not effective, making good urine, holding on further diuresis, and planning for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement this week due to poor neurologic status.

The patient continues to spike fevers daily for the past three days, which may be due to pneumonia, drug fever, or autonomic instability. Blood and urine cultures are negative to date, and a repeat stool culture has not been sent yet. 

The neurologic decline is attributed to [Last Name (un)] encephalitis, and the patient remains alert and oriented only to time, place, and person. EEG findings show widespread encephalopathy without epileptiform features. 

Autonomic instability and hypertension are likely secondary to neurologic disease, and the patient's renal function has improved with increased urine output and decreased creatinine"

   - follow sputum culture from [**2154-7-10**]
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix
   - continue daily wakeup and RSBI
   Fevers: Unclear etiology.  Continues to spike fevers daily.  No recent
   positive blood cultures.  Now off antibiotics.  Urine and blood
   cultures negative to date.  C. diff pending.  Sputum culture from
   yesterday pending.  Drug fever or fever from autonomic instability also
   possible.  PE/DVT less likely although must remain in the
   differential.  Differential from yesterday with left shift although
   this may also be from high dose steroids.
   - holding antibiotics
   - resend c. diff
   - follow cultures
   - LP yesterday without evidence of infection but will follow culture
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite IVIG.  Repeat LP
   yesterday with samples sent for cytometry and cytology.

   - haldol prn for agitation
   Autonomic instability/Hypertension: likely secondary to neurologic
   disease.  Seems to drop UOP with lablile BPs and hypotension.  Urine
   output improved with higher blood pressures.
   - continue hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID
   - treat systolic of 180
   Hypernatremia:  Serum sodium difficult to control despite free water
   flushes per NGT.  Urine osms 441 not decreased.
   - continue D5W and free water flushes per NGT
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today to 1.6, also with
   improved urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating
   blood pressures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated after an aspiration event and is currently on pressure support ventilation. There is persistent atelectasis on chest X-ray, and long-term plans for a tracheostomy have been made. The patient has been experiencing daily fevers with no clear etiology, and cultures are pending. He has leukocytosis with a left shift, likely due to high-dose steroids. The patient's neurologic decline persists despite IVIG, and repeat LP was done with samples sent for cytometry and cytology. He also has autonomic instability and hypertension, likely secondary to neurologic disease, and his serum sodium is difficult to control. There is evidence of acute renal failure, possibly related to hypotension and fluctuating blood pressures. The patient has a history of ACS with NSTEMI and is on appropriate medications for it. There are concerns about leukocytosis, thrush, and hypernatremia, and the patient's nutritional status needs attention. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and presence of atelectasis on chest X-ray increase the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed and performing mouth care should be continued to prevent this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions.  CXR notable for persistent
   atelectasis.  Currently on pressure support [**8-14**].  Off antibiotics.
   Long term plan for trach but unable to do so until plavix has been off
   for seven days.
   - follow sputum culture from [**2154-7-10**]
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix
   - continue daily wakeup and RSBI
   Fevers: Unclear etiology.  Continues to spike fevers daily.  No recent
   positive blood cultures.  Now off antibiotics.  Urine and blood
   cultures negative to date.  C. diff pending.  Sputum culture from
   yesterday pending.  Drug fever or fever from autonomic instability also
   possible.  PE/DVT less likely although must remain in the
   differential.  Differential from yesterday with left shift although
   this may also be from high dose steroids.
   - holding antibiotics
   - resend c. diff
   - follow cultures
   - LP yesterday without evidence of infection but will follow culture
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite IVIG.  Repeat LP
   yesterday with samples sent for cytometry and cytology.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - follow LP cytology and cytometry
   - continue high dose steroids day 3
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Coffee Ground Emesis:  Patient with a single episode of coffee grounds
   noted in NGT yesterday after LP.  Hematocrit stable.
   - repeat type and screen
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hematocrits
   - d/c plavix
   Autonomic instability/Hypertension: likely secondary to neurologic
   disease.  Seems to drop UOP with lablile BPs and hypotension.  Urine
   output improved with higher blood pressures.
   - continue hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID
   - treat systolic of 180
   Hypernatremia:  Serum sodium difficult to control despite free water
   flushes per NGT.  Urine osms 441 not decreased.
   - continue D5W and free water flushes per NGT
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today to 1.6, also with
   improved urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating
   blood pressures.
   - more liberal blood pressure management
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - UOP improving with increasing BP
   - renally dose medications, trend creatinine
   ACS:  NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, statin, beta blocker
   - d/c plavix given plans for trach
   Leukocytosis: stable, slightly higher , follow fever curve
   - Check diff
   Thrush: nystatin

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. The patient has undergone intubation due to an aspiration event. The patient's current medical conditions include aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, fevers of unclear etiology, neurologic decline, coffee ground emesis, autonomic instability/hypertension, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and ACS/NSTEMI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia due to the aspiration event. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis if not managed appropriately.

2. Fevers: The patient continues to spike fevers daily, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

3. Neurologic decline: The patient's neurological condition is worsening, and the diagnosis of [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis has been made. Monitoring and management of the patient's neurological status are crucial to prevent further deterioration.

4. Coffee ground emesis: The presence of coffee ground emesis suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. This condition requires evaluation and management to determine the source of bleeding and provide appropriate treatment.

5. Autonomic instability/hypertension: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations may be related to autonomic instability secondary to neurologic disease. Close monitoring and management are"

   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions.  CXR notable for persistent
   atelectasis.   Overnight had worsening respiratory distress and
   hypoxia.  CXR last night without significant worsening.  Switched back
   to AC overnight with 50% FiO2.  Off antibiotics.  Long term plan for
   trach but unable to do so until plavix has been off for seven days.
   - follow sputum culture from [**2154-7-10**]
   - repeat ABG this morning
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix
   - will attempt to wean back to pressure support today
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Not febrile for past 24 hours.  Unclear etiology.
   No recent positive blood cultures.  Now off antibiotics.  Urine and
   blood cultures negative to date.  C. diff pending.  Sputum culture from
   [**2154-7-10**]  pending.  Drug fever or fever from autonomic instability also
   possible.  He had negative lower extremity  ultrasounds yesterday.
   Differential from [**2154-7-10**] with left shift although this may also be from
   high dose steroids.
   - holding antibiotics
   - resend c. diff
   - follow cultures
   - LP without evidence of infection but will follow culture
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite IVIG.  Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**]
   with samples sent for cytometry and cytology.   Per neurology,
   following commands and exam improved.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - follow LP cytology and cytometry
   - continue high dose steroids day 4
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Autonomic instability/Hypertension: likely secondary to neurologic
   disease.  Seems to drop UOP with lablile BPs and hypotension.  Urine
   output improved with higher blood pressures.
   - continue hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID
   - treat systolic of 180
   Hypernatremia:  Serum sodium difficult to control despite free water
   flushes per NGT.  Urine osms 468 yesterday.  Differential diagnosis
   includes post-ATN diuresis versus diabetes insipidus.
   - continue D5W
   - free water flushes per NGT currently on hold given worsening
   respiratory status but can restart
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today to 1.3, also with
   increased urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating
   blood pressures.
   - more liberal blood pressure management
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - UOP improving with increasing BP
   - renally dose medications, trend creatinine
   ACS:  NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, statin, beta blocker
   - d/c plavix given plans for trach
   Coffee Ground Emesis:  Patient with a single episode of coffee grounds
   noted in NGT yesterday after LP.  Hematocrit slightly decreased this
   morning at 25.3 from 28.1.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has a history of anxiety, grieving, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypertension (malignant), and renal failure. The patient is currently intubated due to an aspiration event and respiratory failure. His condition has been complicated by fevers/leukocytosis, autonomic instability/hypertension, and an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Other ongoing issues include hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and potential infections such as aspiration pneumonia and Clostridium difficile. The patient is also being treated for thrush and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and considering early weaning from mechanical ventilation if appropriate.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Despite negative lower extremity ultrasounds, the patient is still at risk for DVT due to immobility and other risk factors. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should continue.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has had multiple antibiotics"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. However, several significant events occurred within a 24-hour period. The patient's renal function showed a decrease in urine output, requiring free water repletion. The differential diagnosis for hypernatremia includes diabetes insipidus and post-ATN diuresis. 

The patient continues on high-dose solumedrol as per neurology orders. Bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds were negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient experienced a second episode of coffee ground emesis and is still unable to send C. difficile. 

The patient was started on lantus 20 U daily for hyperglycemia. Overnight, they had worsening hypoxia and discomfort, prompting the placement of the patient on airway control (AC) with improvement. The chest X-ray overnight was unchanged.

The patient has allergies to eptifibatide and unknown medications. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on [**2154-7-9**] at 08:00 AM and cefepime on [**2154-7-10**] at 02:09 AM.

The patient is currently receiving propofol at a rate of 25 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include metoprolol, which was initiated on [**2154-7-11**] at 10:04 PM.

   Assessment and Plan: 65 year old male with acute neurologic decline
   currently attributed to [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration
   event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions.  CXR notable for persistent
   atelectasis.  Overnight had worsening respiratory distress and
   hypoxia.  CXR last night without significant worsening.  Switched back
   to AC overnight with 50% FiO2.  Off antibiotics.  Long term plan for
   trach but unable to do so until plavix has been off for seven days.
   - restart hyoscamine given need for hourly suctioning of secretions
   - follow sputum culture from [**2154-7-10**]
   - repeat ABG this morning
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix
   - will attempt to wean back to pressure support today
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease.
   Currently hypotensive likely in setting of increased propofol. Seems to
   drop UOP with lablile BPs and hypotension.  Urine output improved with
   higher blood pressures.
   - reassess for improvement in BP with weaning of propofol
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID with strict holding parameters for
   now
   - continue hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   - treat systolic of 180
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Not febrile for past 24 hours; is on solumedrol.
   Unclear etiology.  No recent positive blood cultures.  Now off
   antibiotics.  Urine and blood cultures negative to date.  C. diff
   pending.  Sputum culture from [**2154-7-10**]  pending.  Drug fever or fever
   from autonomic instability also possible.  He had negative lower
   extremity  ultrasounds yesterday.  Differential from [**2154-7-10**] with left
   shift although this may also be from high dose steroids.
   - holding antibiotics
   - resend c. diff
   - follow cultures
   - LP without evidence of infection but will follow culture
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite IVIG.  Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**]
   with samples sent for cytometry and cytology.   Per neurology,
   following commands and exam improved.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - follow LP cytology and cytometry
   - continue high dose steroids day [**4-14**]
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Hypernatremia:  Serum sodium difficult to control despite free water
   flushes per NGT.  Urine osms 468 yesterday.  Differential diagnosis
   includes post-ATN diuresis versus diabetes insipidus.
   - continue D5W
   - restart free water flushes per NG tube
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today to 1.3, also with
   increased urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating
   blood pressures.
   - blood pressure management as above
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - UOP improving with increasing BP
   - renally dose medications, trend creatinine
   Coffee Ground Emesis:  Patient with a single episode of coffee grounds
   noted in NGT yesterday after LP.  Hematocrit slightly decreased this
   morning at 25.3 from 28.1.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to [Last Name (un)] encephalitis. The patient has undergone intubation after an aspiration event. The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications, which include:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent atelectasis and worsening respiratory distress, indicating a need for further intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Autonomic instability: The patient is hypotensive and exhibits fluctuating blood pressures, likely secondary to neurologic disease. Management includes reassessing for improvement in BP with weaning of propofol, continuing metoprolol, using hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180, and treating systolic of 180.

3. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient is not febrile for the past 24 hours but was previously febrile. Antibiotics have been held, and cultures (blood, urine, sputum) are negative to date. Drug fever or fever from autonomic instability is also considered.

4. Neurologic decline: The patient's mental status has persisted despite IVIG, and an EEG showed widespread encephalopathy without epileptiform features. The most likely diagnosis is [Last Name (un)] encephalitis. A repeat LP with samples sent for cytometry and cytology is planned.

   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions.  CXR notable for persistent
   atelectasis.  Currently on pressure support [**8-14**].  Off antibiotics.
   Long term plan for trach but unable to do so until plavix has been off
   for seven days.

   - continue daily wakeup and RSBI
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Unclear etiology.  Continues to spike fevers
   daily.  No recent positive blood cultures.  Now off antibiotics.  Urine
   and blood cultures negative to date.  C. diff pending.  Sputum culture
   from yesterday pending.  Drug fever or fever from autonomic instability
   also possible.  PE/DVT less likely although must remain in the
   differential.  Differential from yesterday with left shift although
   this may also be from high dose steroids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with hypoxia and atelectasis seen on chest X-ray. He is off antibiotics, and a sputum culture from 07/10 will be followed. The patient's fevers and leukocytosis are unresolved, with negative blood and urine cultures. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample was taken on 07/10 for cytology and cytometry. The patient's neurologic condition is consistent with encephalitis, and he is being treated with high-dose steroids. There are concerns about autonomic instability and hypertension, likely secondary to neurologic disease. The patient has hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and a history of ACS with NSTEMI. He is also experiencing coffee ground emesis, for which a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been prescribed."

   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to

   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Significant pooling
   secretions
 stopped hycosamine because of concern for secretions being
   too thick.  Overnight had worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia of
   unclear etiology, but may be due to worsening secretions.  CXR last
   night without significant worsening; persistent atelectasis.  Switched
   back to AC overnight with 50% FiO2.  S/p antibiotics course.
   - Wean to PS this am
   - Wean FiO2
   - Restart hycosamine for increased secretions
   - F/u sputum culture
   - Plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix (d/c
ed [**7-10**])
   Hypotension: Thought due to autonomic dysregulation and increased
   propofol overnight. Alternates with hypertension.
   - Wean propofol
   - Follow and consider fluid bolus if not improving
   - Hold antihypertensives until BP improved
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Now afebrile x 24 hours.  Unclear etiology.  Drug
   fever or fever from autonomic instability possible.  Cultures and lower
   extremity ultrasounds negative.
   - Follow fever curve
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**] with samples sent for
   cytometry and cytology.   Per neurology, following commands and exam
   improved as of yesterday.
   - S/p IVIG
   - Continue high dose steroids day [**4-14**]
   - Wean propofol
   Hypernatremia:  Serum sodium difficult to control despite free water
   flushes per NGT.  Urine osms 468 yesterday.  Differential diagnosis
   includes post-ATN diuresis versus diabetes insipidus.
   - continue D5W
   - free water flushes per NGT currently on hold given worsening
   respiratory status but can restart
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today to 1.3, also with
   increased urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating
   blood pressures.
   - Avoid hypotension
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   Coffee Ground Emesis:  Patient with episode of coffee grounds noted in
   NGT yesterday after LP and again this am.  Hematocrit slightly
   decreased this morning at 25.3 from 28.1.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, with hypoxia and increased secretions. The CXR remains unchanged, showing persistent atelectasis. 

The plan includes weaning off propofol, restarting hyoscine (hycosamine) for increased secretions, following up with sputum culture, and planning for a tracheostomy after seven days off Plavix (discontinue Plavix on 7-10). 

The patient also has hypotension, which is thought to be due to autonomic dysregulation and increased propofol overnight. Alternatives with hypertension have been observed. The plan is to wean propofol, follow and consider fluid bolus if not improving, and hold antihypertensives until the blood pressure improves.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis are now resolved. The etiology of the fever is unclear, with possibilities including drug fever or fever from autonomic instability. Cultures and lower extremity ultrasounds have been negative. 

Neurologically, the patient's decline is consistent with widespresad encephalopathy seen on EEG. The most likely diagnosis per neurology is [Last Name (un)] encephalitis. Repeat lumbar puncture (LP) on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis, who has now experienced an aspiration event and intubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is worsening, with increasing respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient is also experiencing hypotension and hypertension, fevers/leukocytosis, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and coffee ground emesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increased secretions and worsening oxygenation indicate a concern for VAP. Sputum cultures have been sent, and the patient is planned for a tracheostomy after seven days off Plavix.

2. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's recent aspiration event and ongoing secretions pose a risk for further episodes of aspiration pneumonitis.

3. Hypotension and hypertension: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations may require further evaluation and management to prevent complications such as organ damage or cardiac issues.

4. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count could indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process. Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high serum sodium levels require careful management to avoid complications like dehydration or neurological disturbances.

6. Acute renal failure: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/61 mmHg to 167/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,757 mL and output of 2,280 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 523 mL. Laboratory results indicate hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, altered mental status, fever, hypertension, renal failure, and signs of myocardial infarction. The patient is receiving various medications including propofol, lansoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, indicating hypernatremia. If left untreated, this can lead to dehydration, neurological dysfunction, and potentially seizures.

   [**2154-7-10**] CSF pathology: RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light
   scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.  Due to paucicellular
   nature of the specimen, a limited panel is performed to determine
   B-cell clonality.  B cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of
   clonality.  T cells comprise 96% of lymphoid gated
   events. INTERPRETATION: Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile;
   diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin
   B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.  Correlation with clinical
   findings is recommended.  Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not
   detect all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline due to suspected [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. The patient has been intubated after an aspiration event. He is currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, autonomic instability, fevers/leukocytosis, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, coffee ground emesis, and a history of NSTEMI. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, hydralazine, heparin, lansoprazole, hyoscyamine, and sololemrol. He is also receiving IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and a steroid course for his encephalitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged intubation and ventilatory support: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which carries risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event increases the risk of developing pneumonia, which can be a significant complication in critically ill patients.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions.  CXR notable for persistent
   atelectasis.  Overnight had worsening respiratory distress and
   hypoxia.  CXR last night without significant worsening.  Switched back
   to AC overnight with 50% FiO2.  Off antibiotics.  Long term plan for
   trach but unable to do so until plavix has been off for seven days.
   - restart hyoscamine given need for hourly suctioning of secretions
   - follow sputum culture from [**2154-7-10**]
   - repeat ABG this morning
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix
   - will attempt to wean back to pressure support today
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease.
   Currently hypotensive likely in setting of increased propofol. Seems to
   drop UOP with lablile BPs and hypotension.  Urine output improved with
   higher blood pressures.
   - reassess for improvement in BP with weaning of propofol
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID with strict holding parameters for
   now
   - continue hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   - treat systolic of 180
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Not febrile for past 24 hours; is on solumedrol.
   Unclear etiology.  No recent positive blood cultures.  Now off
   antibiotics.  Urine and blood cultures negative to date.  C. diff
   pending.  Sputum culture from [**2154-7-10**]  pending.  Drug fever or fever
   from autonomic instability also possible.  He had negative lower
   extremity  ultrasounds yesterday.  Differential from [**2154-7-10**] with left
   shift although this may also be from high dose steroids.
   - holding antibiotics
   - resend c. diff
   - follow cultures
   - LP without evidence of infection but will follow culture
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. AMS persists despite IVIG.  Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**]
   with samples sent for cytometry and cytology.   Per neurology,
   following commands and exam improved.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - follow LP cytology and cytometry
   - continue high dose steroids day [**4-14**]
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Hypernatremia:  Serum sodium difficult to control despite free water
   flushes per NGT.  Urine osms 468 yesterday.  Differential diagnosis
   includes post-ATN diuresis versus diabetes insipidus.
   - continue D5W
   - restart free water flushes per NG tube
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today to 1.3, also with
   increased urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating
   blood pressures.
   - blood pressure management as above
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - UOP improving with increasing BP
   - renally dose medications, trend creatinine
   Coffee Ground Emesis:  Patient with a single episode of coffee grounds
   noted in NGT yesterday after LP.  Hematocrit slightly decreased this
   morning at 25.3 from 28.1.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hematocrits
   - off plavix currently
   - Active T&S
   ACS: NSTEMI
   -cont ASA, statin, beta blocker
   - d/c plavix given plans for trach
   Thrush: nystatin

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He was intubated after an aspiration event. The patient has aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration and pooling secretions. He also has autonomic instability, fevers/leukocytosis, and neurologic decline due to encephalitis. The patient is hypernatremic, has acute renal failure, and experienced coffee ground emesis. He has a history of ACS with NSTEMI and thrush. The patient's current medications include lansoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and various ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to aspiration and pooling secretions. This increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Autonomic instability: The patient's hypotension and labile blood pressures may indicate autonomic instability, which can lead to complications such as hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Neurologic decline: The patient's encephalitis and AMS (altered mental status) require careful monitoring for further neurological deterioration.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated serum sodium levels need"

   nature of the specimen, a limited panel is performed to determine
   B-cell clonality.  B cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of

   diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin
   B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.  Correlation with clinical
   findings is recommended.  Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not
   detect all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample

   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. Off antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum cx negative. CXR notable for
   persistent atelectasis. Long term plan for trach but unable to do so
   until plavix has been off for seven days
   - cont hyoscyamine for secretions
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix ([**2154-7-17**])
   - will attempt to wean back to pressure support today

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has undergone intubation due to an aspiration event. The patient is currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, autonomic instability, fevers/leukocytosis, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, coffee ground emesis, ACS/NSTEMI, and thrush. He is also being closely monitored for ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged intubation and ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure may require extended mechanical ventilation support, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and endotracheal tube-related complications.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's encephalitis could lead to further neurological decline, potentially resulting in persistent altered mental status or even brain death.
3. Autonomic instability: The patient's autonomic dysfunction may cause fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate, leading to potential hypotension or hypertension episodes, which can affect organ perfusion.
4. Infection: Despite negative cultures so far, the patient is still at risk for developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), or urinary tract infections (UTIs).
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, necessitating renal replacement therapy (RRT)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event. The patient's conditions include aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, autonomic instability, fevers/leukocytosis, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, coffee ground emesis, and ACS/NSTEMI. He is currently being treated with various medications and interventions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a critical concern due to his aspiration event and current need for mechanical ventilation. The risk of further respiratory compromise may arise if there are issues with weaning off the ventilator or if there is a development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Autonomic Instability: The patient's autonomic instability poses a risk for hemodynamic instability, which can lead to hypotension or hypertension. This can affect organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications.

3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: Despite initial negative cultures, the patient's persistent leukocytosis and fevers suggest an ongoing infectious process. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels require careful management to prevent dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. Frequent monitoring of sodium levels and appropriate fluid management are necessary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by autonomic instability, fevers/leukocytosis, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, coffee ground emesis, and a history of ACS with NSTEMI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia indicate a potential complication related to aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory function is necessary.

2. Autonomic Instability: The patient's hypotension and fluctuating blood pressures suggest autonomic instability. This may be secondary to neurologic disease or the effects of propofol. Monitoring blood pressure closely and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.

3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient's fevers and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection. It is essential to follow cultures and treat appropriately while avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use.

4. Neurologic Decline: The patient's ongoing neurologic decline requires close monitoring of mental status and neurological examination. EEG findings suggest encephalopathy, but epileptiform features are absent. Repeat LP with samples sent for cytometry and cytology is planned.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels are difficult to control,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event. The patient's current conditions include aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, neurologic decline, autonomic instability, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and coffee ground emesis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has pooling of secretions, which can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for tracheostomy after seven days off Plavix.
2. Neurologic Decline: The patient's EEG shows widespread encephalopathy, and the most likely diagnosis is encephalitis. Repeat LP with samples sent for cytometry and cytology is planned.
3. Autonomic Instability: The patient has hypertension/hypotension, and measures such as continuing metoprolol and avoiding too much propofol are being implemented.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has a high white blood cell count, which could be secondary to steroids. Cultures and lower extremity ultrasounds are negative, and infectious causes like Clostridium difficile are being ruled out.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, and the differential diagnosis includes post-ATN diuresis versus diabetes insipidus. Free water flushes through the NG"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurologic decline attributed to [Last Name (un)] encephalitis. The patient's current medical condition includes aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, neurologic decline, autonomic instability, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and coffee ground emesis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to the aspiration event and intubation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise, which may require increased ventilatory support or tracheostomy.

2. Neurologic deterioration: The patient's neurologic decline indicates encephalitis, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring and management of neurological status is essential.

3. Autonomic instability: The patient has episodes of hypertension and hypotension, indicating autonomic instability. This can be potentially dangerous and requires close monitoring and appropriate management.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to neurological complications if not managed appropriately.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, likely related to hypotension and fluctuating blood pressures. Renal function should be closely monitored, and measures taken to avoid further deterioration.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Significant pooling
   secretions
 stopped hycosamine because of concern for secretions being
   too thick, but now restarted.  Weaned off A/C to PS this am.  S/p
   antibiotics course.
   - Recheck ABG on PS
   - Wean FiO2
   - Restart hycosamine for increased secretions
   - F/u sputum culture
   - Plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix (d/c
ed [**7-10**])
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**] with samples sent for
   cytometry and cytology.   Per neurology, following commands and exam
   improved as of yesterday.
   - S/p IVIG
   - Continue high dose steroids day [**5-14**]
   - Wean propofol
   Autonomic instability:  Hypertension/hypotension.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Avoid too much propofol as made him hypotensive
   Leukocytosis: Now afebrile x 48 hours.  Cultures and lower extremity
   ultrasounds negative.  Likely secondary to steroids.
   - R/o infectious cause (c. diff pending)
   Hypernatremia: Differential diagnosis includes post-ATN diuresis versus
   diabetes insipidus.  Difficult to control despite free water flushes
   per NGT, worsened yesterday when he pulled out his OGT.
   - continue D5W
   - free water flushes per NGT
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine continuing to improve with increased
   urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating blood
   pressures.
   - Avoid hypotension
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   Coffee Ground Emesis:  Patient with episode of coffee grounds noted in
   NGT yesterday after LP and again this am.  Hematocrit slightly
   decreased this morning at 25.3 from 28.1.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis, who is currently intubated due to an aspiration event. The patient's medical complications include:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has significant pooling of secretions and has been weaned off assisted ventilation to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The plan includes restarting hyoscine (to reduce secretions), rechecking arterial blood gas (ABG) on PSV, weaning FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen), and following up with sputum culture.

2. Neurologic Decline: The patient is suspected to have encephalitis, as indicated by an EEG showing widespread encephalopathy without epileptiform features. A repeat lumbar puncture (LP) with samples sent for cytometry and cytology is planned. The patient has received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and high-dose steroids.

3. Autonomic Instability: The patient exhibits hypertension/hypotension and is being treated with metoprolol. Propofol administration should be monitored closely to avoid hypotension.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but he is afebrile and cultures and lower extremity ultrasounds are negative. This may be secondary to steroid treatment.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium"

   back to AC overnight with 50% FiO2.  S/p antibiotics course.
   - Wean to PS this am
   - Wean FiO2
   - Restart hycosamine for increased secretions
   - F/u sputum culture
   - Plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix (d/c
ed [**7-10**])
   Hypotension: Thought due to autonomic dysregulation and increased
   propofol overnight. Alternates with hypertension.
   - Wean propofol
   - Follow and consider fluid bolus if not improving
   - Hold antihypertensives until BP improved
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Now afebrile x 24 hours.  Unclear etiology.  Drug
   fever or fever from autonomic instability possible.  Cultures and lower
   extremity ultrasounds negative.
   - Follow fever curve
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**] with samples sent for
   cytometry and cytology.   Per neurology, following commands and exam
   improved as of yesterday.
   - S/p IVIG
   - Continue high dose steroids day [**4-14**]
   - Wean propofol
   Hypernatremia:  Serum sodium difficult to control despite free water
   flushes per NGT.  Urine osms 468 yesterday.  Differential diagnosis
   includes post-ATN diuresis versus diabetes insipidus.
   - continue D5W
   - free water flushes per NGT currently on hold given worsening
   respiratory status but can restart
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improved today to 1.3, also with
   increased urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating
   blood pressures.
   - Avoid hypotension
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   Coffee Ground Emesis:  Patient with episode of coffee grounds noted in
   NGT yesterday after LP and again this am.  Hematocrit slightly
   decreased this morning at 25.3 from 28.1.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis, who is currently intubated for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is experiencing hypoxia, atelectasis, and thick secretions that require frequent suctioning. The patient's blood pressure fluctuates between hypotension and hypertension, possibly due to autonomic dysregulation and increased propofol. He has been febrile, but now afebrile, with leukocytosis of unclear etiology. The neurologic decline is consistent with encephalitis, and an EEG shows widespread encephalopathy without epileptiform features. The patient is receiving IVIG and high-dose steroids. He has hypernatremia, which is difficult to control despite free water flushes, and acute renal failure, likely related to hypotension and fluctuating blood pressures. The patient also has coffee ground emesis, suggesting possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of respiratory support, blood pressure, fever, neurologic status, electrolyte imbalance, and potential bleeding complications."

   FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2154-7-13**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2154-7-13**] CXR: Endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet. There is patch
y consolidation of the right middle lobe and lower lobe, which has increased sin
ce the prior study. There is also consolidation of the left lower lobe. There ar
e small bilateral pleural effusions. Heart and mediastinum are probably within n
ormal limits. IMPRESSION: Overall worsening since prior study as above.
   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. Off antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum cx negative. CXR notable for
   persistent atelectasis. Long term plan for trach but unable to do so
   until plavix has been off for seven days.  Over past 48 hours has had
   worsening respiratory status requiring increased mechanical support
   secondary to apneic episodes.  Unclear if this is related to neurologic
   disease. CXR with consolidations and small effusions.
   - hyoscyamine again discontinued for secretions
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix ([**2154-7-17**])
   - will attempt to wean back to pressure support today
   - Check ABG on PS
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease
   exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. UOP sensitive to hypotension.
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID with strict holding parameters for
   now
   - hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Afebrile since [**7-11**] although with
   neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis in setting of solumedrol. Off
   antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum and urine cx negative. Blood and CSF cx NGTD.
   C. diff neg x 1. [**2154-7-11**] LENIs neg.  Drug fever or fever from autonomic
   instability also possible.  Diff with 95% PMN, no bands

   steriods.
   - r/o c. diff x 3
   - f/u blood and CSF cultures
   - hold abx for now
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis although GQ1B Ab neg.  Exam fluctuates. Repeat
   LP [**2154-7-10**] appears noninfectious, cx pending. Flow cytometry with
   non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; cytology neg for
   malignant cells.  Has now completed 5 day course of IVIG followed by
   five day course of high dose steroids.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Hypernatremia:  Elevated again as free water flushes held while OGT
   out; now restarted. Likely [**2-11**] post-ATN diuresis of urea, less likely
   diabetes insipidus.
   - cont free water flushes per NG tube
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   - consider DDAVP trial if hypernatremia and large UOP persist
   Acute Renal Failure:  ATN likely [**2-11**] hypotension resolving with Cr
   stable at 1.1.
   - blood pressure management as above
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - UOP improving with increasing BP
   - renally dose medications, trend creatinine
   Coffee Ground Emesis:  Patient with two episodes of coffee ground
   emesis last week.  Hematocrit slightly downtrended but stable.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. He was intubated after an aspiration event and has been in the ICU since then. The patient has multiple medical complications including aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, autonomic instability, fevers/leukocytosis, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, coffee ground emesis, and a history of ACS/NSTEMI.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation (MMV/PSV mode), with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, requiring increased mechanical support due to apneic episodes. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 33 mmHg, pH 7.31, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 109 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. Chest X-ray (CXR) shows patchy consolidation of the right middle lobe and lower lobe, as well"

   persistent atelectasis. Long term plan for trach but unable to do so
   until plavix has been off for seven days.  Over past 48 hours has had
   worsening respiratory status requiring increased mechanical support
   secondary to apneic episodes.  Unclear if this is related to neurologic
   disease. CXR with consolidations and small effusions.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurologic decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis, who has now developed aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure after an aspiration event. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has been experiencing frequent desats events that have been resolved with suctioning. The patient's chest X-ray shows persistent atelectasis, small bilateral pleural effusions, and patchy consolidation in the right middle lobe and lower lobe, which has increased since the prior study. 

The patient has also been diagnosed with autonomic instability, likely secondary to neurologic disease exacerbated when propofol was uptitrated. His blood pressure is sensitive to hypotension, and he is currently being managed with metoprolol and hydralazine.

Additionally, the patient has fevers and leukocytosis, but has been afebrile since [7-11]. His blood cultures are negative, and he has tested negative for C. difficile and Legionella. 

The patient's neurologic decline is attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis, although GQ1B antibody is negative. An electroencephalogram (EEG) shows widespread encephalopathy without epileptiform features.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. The patient has been intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's respiratory status has been worsening over the past 48 hours, requiring increased mechanical support. The chest X-ray shows consolidations and small effusions. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is being weaned back to pressure support today.

The patient also has autonomic instability likely secondary to neurologic disease, exacerbated when propofol was uptitrated. The patient's blood pressure is sensitive to hypotension, and they are on metoprolol 50mg QID with strict holding parameters. Hydralazine is given PRN for SBPs > 180.

The patient had fevers and leukocytosis, but is now afebrile since [7-11]. The patient's white blood cell count shows neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis in the setting of solumedrol. The patient is off antibiotics, with negative sputum and urine cultures. Blood and CSF cultures are pending. The patient also has C. diff negative x 1 and a negative Lenis test.

The patient's neurologic decline is consistent with [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis, although GQ1B"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. Off antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum cx negative. CXR notable for
   persistent atelectasis. Long term plan for trach but unable to do so
   until plavix has been off for seven days.  Over past 48 hours has had
   worsening respiratory status requiring increased mechanical support
   secondary to apneic episodes.  Unclear if this is related to neurologic
   disease. CXR with consolidations and small effusions.
   - hyoscyamine again discontinued for secretions
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix ([**2154-7-17**])
   - will attempt to wean back to pressure support today
   - Check ABG on PS
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease
   exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. UOP sensitive to hypotension.
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID with strict holding parameters for
   now
   - hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Afebrile since [**7-11**] although with
   neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis in setting of solumedrol. Off
   antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum and urine cx negative. Blood and CSF cx NGTD.
   C. diff neg x 1. [**2154-7-11**] LENIs neg.  Drug fever or fever from autonomic
   instability also possible.  Diff with 95% PMN, no bands

   non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; cytology neg for
   malignant cells.  Has now completed 5 day course of IVIG followed by
   five day course of high dose steroids.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Hypernatremia:  Elevated again as free water flushes held while OGT
   out; now restarted. Likely [**2-11**] post-ATN diuresis of urea, less likely

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. He has been intubated after an aspiration event and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening over the past 48 hours, with frequent apneic episodes requiring increased mechanical support. His chest X-ray shows consolidations and small bilateral pleural effusions. He also has hypernatremia, likely secondary to post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis of urea or less likely diabetes insipidus. The patient has acute renal failure with a stable creatinine level of 1.1 and is being managed with careful blood pressure control. He has had episodes of coffee ground emesis, and there are concerns about gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is also being treated for thrush.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, and he requires increased mechanical support due to apneic episodes. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's episodes of coffee ground emesis raise concerns about gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be due to stress ulcers, coagulopathy, or other underlying conditions. Monitoring for signs of active bleeding and taking appropriate measures to control it is essential.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels need"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. Off antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum cx negative. CXR notable for
   persistent atelectasis. Long term plan for trach but unable to do so
   until plavix has been off for seven days
   - f/u final CXR read
   - cont hyoscyamine for secretions
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix ([**2154-7-17**])
   - will attempt to wean back to pressure support today
   - Check ABG on PS
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease
   exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. UOP sensitive to hypotension.
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID with strict holding parameters for
   now
   - hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Afebrile since [**7-11**] although with
   neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis in setting of solumedrol. Off
   antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum and urine cx negative. Blood and CSF cx NGTD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's recent events include being placed back on pressure support (PS) 8/5 with frequent apneic episodes on tele but maintaining sats in the mid-90s. An AM chest X-ray showed patchy right middle lobe and right lower lobe consolidation, which has increased since the prior study. There is also left lower lobe consolidation, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's vent was switched to MMV mode due to apneic episodes, and he continues to have copious secretions requiring q-hourly suctioning, thicker requiring flushes prior. Hyoscyamine was discontinued.

The patient's sodium levels were elevated again, likely due to free water flushes being held while the orogastric tube (OGT) was out. The differential diagnosis includes post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis versus diabetes insipidus. Free water flushes through the NG tube should be continued, and sodium checks should be done at [Hospital1 7]. Consider a DDAVP trial if large urine output persists.

The patient's renal function has been stable with a creatinine level of 1.2. The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. The patient experienced an aspiration event and subsequent intubation. The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, autonomic instability, fevers/leukocytosis, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, coffee ground emesis, and ACS (acute coronary syndrome) with NSTEMI.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are as follows:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's frequent apneic episodes and maintenance of sats in mid-90s indicate respiratory distress. The presence of patchy RML and RLL consolidation, along with small bilateral pleural effusions on the chest X-ray, suggests the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.

2. Autonomic Instability: The patient's UOP being sensitive to hypotension and the need for strict holding parameters for metoprolol indicate autonomic instability. This condition can lead to fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate, potentially causing further complications.

3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: Although the patient is currently afebrile, the rising leukocytosis raises concerns about an ongoing infection or drug fever. The negative sputum and urine cultures, as well as the absence of bands in the"

   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Significant pooling
   secretions
 stopped hycosamine because of concern for secretions being
   too thick, but now restarted.  Weaned off A/C to PS this am.  S/p
   antibiotics course.
   - Recheck ABG on PS
   - Wean FiO2
   - Restart hycosamine for increased secretions
   - F/u sputum culture
   - Plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix (d/c
ed [**7-10**])
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**] with samples sent for
   cytometry and cytology.   Per neurology, following commands and exam
   improved as of yesterday.
   - S/p IVIG
   - Continue high dose steroids day [**5-14**]
   - Wean propofol
   Autonomic instability:  Hypertension/hypotension.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Avoid too much propofol as made him hypotensive
   Leukocytosis: Now afebrile x 48 hours.  Cultures and lower extremity
   ultrasounds negative.  Likely secondary to steroids.
   - R/o infectious cause (c. diff pending)
   Hypernatremia: Differential diagnosis includes post-ATN diuresis versus
   diabetes insipidus.  Difficult to control despite free water flushes
   per NGT, worsened yesterday when he pulled out his OGT.
   - continue D5W
   - free water flushes per NGT
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine continuing to improve with increased
   urine output.  Likely related to hypotension and fluctuating blood
   pressures.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications, including aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, neurologic decline, autonomic instability, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and coffee ground emesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's pooling of secretions and the need for hycosamine to thin them suggest a risk of further aspiration. The patient is already intubated and receiving antibiotics for pneumonia. Monitoring and managing airway protection and ventilation parameters will be important.
2. Neurologic Decline: The patient's encephalitis may continue to progress, leading to worsening neurological function. Close monitoring of mental status and neurologic exams is necessary. Repeat lumbar puncture and further diagnostic tests may be needed to determine the cause and guide treatment.
3. Autonomic Instability: The patient's hypertension and hypotension indicate fluctuations in blood pressure. This can lead to organ damage if not properly managed. Close monitoring of vital signs and ongoing treatment with metoprolol to control blood pressure will be necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may be secondary to steroids or an underlying infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and considering additional diagnostic tests to rule"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has had an aspiration event and is currently intubated. He has developed pneumonia, respiratory failure, and autonomic instability. The patient also has leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure, which have been resolved with appropriate management. The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's aspiration event and prolonged intubation put him at risk for developing VAP. Regular suctioning, chest physiotherapy, and elevation of the head of the bed are recommended to prevent this complication.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to encephalitis or other causes. Frequent monitoring and evaluation by neurology are necessary.
3. Autonomic instability: The patient's fluctuating blood pressures indicate autonomic instability, which can lead to cardiovascular complications. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of medications like metoprolol are important.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be managed carefully to avoid complications such as cerebral edema or seizures. Free water flushes and D5W administration should be continued, and sodium checks should be done regularly.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Although the patient's renal failure has resolved, there is still a"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure:  Significant pooling
   secretions
 stopped hycosamine because of concern for secretions being
   too thick.  Weaned off A/C to PS yesterday with apneic episodes, likely
   secondary to neurologic process.  Now on MMV.  S/p antibiotic course.
   No evidence of VAP at this time.
   - Recheck ABG on PS
   - Wean FiO2
   - Plan for tracheostomy on [**7-17**] (after seven days off plavix)
   - Frequent suctioning (no cough/gag)/ Chest PT
   Neurologic decline: EEG c/w widespresad encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) **] encephalitis. Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**] with samples sent for
   cytometry and cytology.   Per neurology, following commands and exam
   improved as of yesterday.
   - S/p IVIG x 5 days
   - S/p high dose steroids x 5 days
   - Wean propofol
   - Discuss with neuro future plan/prognosis
   Autonomic instability:  Hypertension/hypotension.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Avoid too much propofol as made him hypotensive
   Leukocytosis: Now afebrile x 48 hours.  Cultures and lower extremity
   ultrasounds negative.  Likely secondary to steroids.
   - R/o infectious cause (c. diff pending)
   Hypernatremia: Differential diagnosis includes post-ATN diuresis versus
   diabetes insipidus.  Difficult to control despite free water flushes
   per NGT.
   - continue D5W
   - free water flushes per NGT
   - Consider DDAVP trial if persistent
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  Resolved with good urine output.  Likely related
   to hypotension and fluctuating blood pressures.
   - Avoid hypotension
   - Appreciate renal recommendations

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. The patient experienced an aspiration event and was intubated. He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's ABG results show hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's risk factors for VAP include prolonged intubation and immobility. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adherence to weaning guidelines are essential to prevent VAP.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological decline suggests the possibility of further deterioration. Frequent reassessment of neurological status and prompt management of any complications are crucial.
3. Autonomic instability: The patient's history of hypertension and hypotension indicates autonomic instability. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate medication adjustments are necessary to manage this condition.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be due to post-ATN diuresis or diabetes insipidus. Close monitoring of serum sodium levels and appropriate fluid management are required to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient previously experienced acute renal failure, which resolved with good urine output. Close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of hypotension are important to prevent recurrence.
6. Nosocomial infections: Prolong"

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, requiring increased mechanical support. This could lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
2. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological decline may progress, leading to increased severity of encephalitis or other neurological conditions such as seizures or cerebral edema.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient has had a myocardial infarction, which can lead to heart failure or arrhythmias if not managed appropriately.
5. Infection: The patient has had fevers and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. If left untreated, this could progress to sepsis or septic shock.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has coffee ground emesis, which"

   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. Off antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum cx negative. CXR notable for
   persistent atelectasis. Long term plan for trach but unable to do so
   until plavix has been off for seven days.  Over past 48 hours has had
   worsening respiratory status requiring increased mechanical support
   secondary to apneic episodes.  Unclear if this is related to neurologic
   disease. CXR with consolidations and small effusions.
   - hyoscyamine again discontinued for thickened secretions difficult to
   suction
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix ([**2154-7-17**])
   - will attempt to wean back to pressure support today
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease
   exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. UOP sensitive to hypotension.
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID with strict holding parameters for
   now
   - hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Afebrile since [**7-11**] although with
   neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis in setting of solumedrol. Off
   antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum and urine cx negative. Blood and CSF cx NGTD.
   C. diff neg x 1. [**2154-7-11**] LENIs neg.  Drug fever or fever from autonomic
   instability also possible.  Diff with 95% PMN, no bands

   Neurologic decline: EEG on [**2154-7-5**] c/w widespresad encephalopathy but
   no epileptiform features. Most likely diagnosis per neurology is
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis although GQ1B Ab neg.  Exam fluctuates. Repeat
   LP [**2154-7-10**] appears noninfectious, cx pending. Flow cytometry with
   non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; cytology neg for
   malignant cells.  Has now completed 5 day course of IVIG followed by
   five day course of high dose steroids.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Hypernatremia:  Elevated again as free water flushes held while OGT
   out; now restarted. Likely [**2-11**] post-ATN diuresis of urea v. diabetes
   insipidus.  Now urine output has decreased and serum sodium has
   stabilized.
   - cont free water flushes per NG tube
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. The patient had an aspiration event and was subsequently intubated. He is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including:

1. Aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, requiring increased mechanical support due to apneic episodes. This may be related to aspiration and pooling of secretions.

2. Autonomic instability: The patient exhibits signs of autonomic instability, possibly secondary to neurologic disease. This is exacerbated when propofol is uptitrated. The patient's blood pressure is sensitive to hypotension.

3. Fevers/leukocytosis: Although the patient is currently afebrile, he had previous fevers and leukocytosis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, as potential sources such as antibiotics and central nervous system infections have been ruled out.

4. Neurologic decline: The patient's neurologic status has been declining, and an EEG showed widespread encephalopathy without epileptiform features. The most likely diagnosis is [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis, although GQ1B Ab negative. A repeat LP appears noninfectious, with results pending. Flow cytometry revealed a non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile, and cytology was negative for malignant cells. The patient completed a 5"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has experienced a recent aspiration event and is currently intubated. The patient's neurologic status has not shown any signs of improvement since receiving IVIg and high-dose steroids. 

The patient's respiratory condition is critical as he is unable to protect his airway due to brainstem dysfunction. He is being supported with ventilation (PS/MMV) and is scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). 

The patient is also experiencing autonomic instability with episodes of hypertension and hypotension. This is being managed with metoprolol. Propofol is being used cautiously as it has caused hypotension. 

The patient has hyperglycemia, hypernatremia (high sodium), altered mental status, fever, malignant hypertension (hypertensive crisis), anxiety, grieving, acute renal failure, and an acute myocardial infarction. 

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case. These include worsening respiratory failure if the patient's ability to protect his airway does not improve, further deterioration of neurological function, complications from the tracheostomy and PEG procedures, progression of renal failure, and potential cardiovascular events."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. The patient has experienced several medical complications including respiratory failure due to aspiration, hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis/hypertensive emergency), hyperglycemia, altered mental status (not delirium), fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), anxiety, grieving, acute renal failure, and acute myocardial infarction.

The patient's current condition includes an inability to protect the airway due to brainstem dysfunction, autonomic instability with hypertension/hypotension, and elevated bicarbonate levels. The patient is currently intubated and receiving supportive ventilation. He is also on medication for hypertension and cardiac conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, worsening of hypertension, development of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), worsening of renal function, and potential cardiac complications.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, especially blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels. Frequent assessment of the patient's mental status and neurological function should also be conducted. Monitoring fluid balance and electrolyte levels is important to prevent further complications related to renal function. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to manage hyperglycemia.

Close collaboration between the neurology team, critical care team, and other specialists involved will be essential in managing the patient's complex condition and preventing potential complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurologic decline, currently attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis. The patient has been intubated due to an aspiration event. He is being treated for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, requiring increased mechanical support secondary to apneic episodes. There are plans for a tracheostomy after seven days off Plavix. The patient also has autonomic instability, likely secondary to neurologic disease, which is exacerbated when propofol is uptitrated. 

The patient previously had fevers and leukocytosis but is now afebrile. He is off antibiotics and no positive microorganisms have been identified. The patient's neurologic decline is consistent with widespread encephalopathy, but no epileptiform features are observed on EEG. The patient has completed courses of IVIG and high-dose steroids. 

The patient also has hypernatremia, likely due to post-ATN diuresis of urea versus diabetes insipidus. Acute renal failure is suspected, with a stable creatinine level of 1.0-1.1. Anemia is present, with a downtrending hematocrit. The patient has had episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding. Active tissue and blood services are being followed, and transfusion is planned for a hematocrit <21.

   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. Off antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum cx negative. CXR notable for
   persistent atelectasis. Long term plan for trach but unable to do so
   until plavix has been off for seven days.  Over past 48 hours has had
   worsening respiratory status requiring increased mechanical support
   secondary to apneic episodes.  Unclear if this is related to neurologic
   disease. CXR with consolidations and small effusions.
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix ([**2154-7-17**])
   - attempt to wean back to pressure support today
   - hyoscyamine discontinued as thickened secretions difficult to suction
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease
   exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. UOP sensitive to hypotension.
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID with strict holding parameters for
   now
   - hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   Fevers/leukocytosis: Afebrile since [**7-11**] although with
   neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis in setting of solumedrol now
   downtrending. Off antibiotics. No positive micro to date. [**2154-7-11**] LENIs

   Neurologic decline: EEG on [**2154-7-5**] c/w widespread encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Thought to have [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis but
   GQ1B Ab neg.  Exam fluctuates. Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**] appears noninfectious,
   cx pending. Flow cytometry with non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid
   profile; cytology neg for malignant cells.  Has now completed 5 day
   course of IVIG followed by five day course of high dose steroids.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Hypernatremia:  Elevated again as free water flushes held while OGT
   out; now restarted. Likely [**2-11**] post-ATN diuresis of urea v. diabetes
   insipidus.  Now urine output has decreased and serum sodium has
   stabilized.
   - cont free water flushes per NG tube
   - [**Hospital1 7**] sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  ATN likely [**2-11**] hypotension resolving with Cr
   stable at 1.0-1.1.
   - blood pressure management as above

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurologic decline attributed to [Last Name (un) 8413] encephalitis, now post-aspiration event and intubation. He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desaturation episodes resolved with suctioning. He is currently on mechanical ventilation support due to apneic episodes. A chest X-ray shows persistent atelectasis.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several other issues. He has autonomic instability, likely secondary to neurologic disease exacerbated when propofol was uptitrated. This has resulted in episodes of hypotension and difficulty managing blood pressure. Metoprolol has been initiated at 50 mg QID with strict holding parameters.

The patient also has fevers and leukocytosis, which have resolved since [7-11]. Although he is currently afebrile, he still has neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis in the setting of solumedrol. He is off antibiotics, with negative sputum and urine cultures. Blood and CSF cultures are pending, and the possibility of drug fever or fever from autonomic instability is also considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, but does not open eyes to voice or follow commands. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions, including hyperglycemia, altered mental status, hypertension (malignant), anxiety, grieving, renal failure (acute), myocardial infarction (acute), and an inability to protect the airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's inability to protect the airway, there is a risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex, which can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications like diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
3. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient is experiencing malignant hypertension, which can lead to severe complications like intracerebral hemorrhage, cardiac rupture, or acute kidney injury if not promptly treated.
4. Renal Failure: Acute renal failure may occur due to the combination of hypertension, hypotensive episodes, or decreased renal perfusion. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and acid-base disturbances.
5. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction, which increases the risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has undergone intubation due to an aspiration event. There are no signs of improvement since receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) and high-dose steroids. The patient's neurologic input is being appreciated, and a plan/prognosis is being discussed with the neuro team. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Autonomic instability: The patient is experiencing hypertension and hypotension, indicating possible autonomic instability. Metoprolol is being continued to manage this condition, and propofol administration is being adjusted to avoid hypotension.
2. Right upper extremity swelling: The patient has swelling in his right upper extremity, which may indicate a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Further evaluation is needed, including checking UENIs for possible PICC-assoc DVT.
3. Downtrending Hct: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are decreasing, which could indicate bleeding or hemolysis. Clinical signs of bleeding are not present, but previous coffee-grounds from the nasogastric tube and iron and folate deficiencies are noted. Hemolysis labs are being checked.
4. Cardiovascular disease (CAD): The patient is off Plavix for a planned tracheostomy/peg tube placement. It is recommended to restart prophylaxis post-procedure and continue aspirin"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He recently experienced an aspiration event and was intubated. The patient has not shown signs of improvement since receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) and high-dose steroids. Neurological input is appreciated, and the plan is to wean propofol as tolerated, discuss future neuro plans/prognosis, and await lumbar puncture (LP) cytology results.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to the inability to protect his airway caused by brainstem dysfunction. It is planned to remove the patient from Plavix for the purpose of a tracheostomy/peg tube placement tomorrow. Supportive ventilation (PS/MMV) will continue, and the patient will remain on metoprolol for autonomic instability. Hypotension should be avoided while reducing propofol dosage.

The patient also has right upper extremity swelling, and possible PICC-associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is being considered. The patient's hematocrit levels are downtrending, with no clinical signs of bleeding but previous coffee grounds from the nasogastric tube, along with suspected iron and folate deficiencies. Hemolysis workup is ongoing, and one unit of red blood cells (RBCs) will be transfused in anticipation of a procedure tomorrow morning. The patient is also on multivitamins (MVI), and aspirin/beta-blocker/statin therapy will be continued.

The patient's nutritional status is being managed with repletion of fiber and a goal of 300cc of fluid intake every four hours. Glycemic control is maintained through regular insulin sliding scale, with good blood sugar control. The patient has multiple lines in place, including a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line inserted on July 2nd. Prophylaxis measures include subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with elevation of the head of bed and oral care. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has had an aspiration event and is currently intubated. There have been no signs of improvement since receiving IVIg and high-dose steroids. The patient's neurologic status is being closely monitored, and future plans/prognosis are to be discussed with neurology.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, as he is unable to protect his airway due to brainstem dysfunction. It is planned to perform a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tomorrow, and he will be taken off Plavix for the procedure. Supportive ventilation is being continued, and the patient's blood pressure fluctuations (hypertension/hypotension) are being managed with metoprolol.

The patient is experiencing right upper extremity swelling, and there is a possibility of a proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) associated with the PICC line. His hematocrit levels are decreasing, indicating possible bleeding or hemolysis, so further investigation is needed. The patient has a history of coffee grounds from the nasogastric tube and iron and folate deficiency. He is also being monitored for potential hemolysis labs.

In terms of nutrition, the patient is receiving enteral nutrition at a rate of 75 mL/hour. His blood sugar levels are well-controlled with regular insulin"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. Off antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum cx negative. CXR notable for
   persistent atelectasis. Long term plan for trach but unable to do so
   until plavix has been off for seven days.  Over past 48 hours has had
   worsening respiratory status requiring increased mechanical support
   secondary to apneic episodes.  Unclear if this is related to neurologic
   disease. CXR with consolidations and small effusions.
   - plan for tracheostomy and PEG when PTT has come down
   - will continue current ventilatory settings in preparation for trach
   (on MMV secondary to periods of apnea).
   - hyoscyamine discontinued as thickened secretions difficult to suction
   - will start rehab screen post procedure
   Elevated PTT
 likely related to Heparin SQ as it started upon
   hospitalization
   - d/c sq heparin
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease
   exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. UOP sensitive to hypotension.
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID with strict holding parameters for
   now
   - hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   Neurologic decline: EEG on [**2154-7-5**] c/w widespread encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Thought to have [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis but
   GQ1B Ab neg.  Exam fluctuates. Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**] appears noninfectious,
   cx pending. Flow cytometry with non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid
   profile; cytology neg for malignant cells.  Has now completed 5 day
   course of IVIG followed by five day course of high dose steroids.
   Strength and mental status slowly improving.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - MRI with and without contrast
   - haldol prn for agitation
   Hypernatremia:  Elevated again as free water flushes held while OGT
   out; now restarted. Likely [**2-11**] post-ATN diuresis of urea v. diabetes
   insipidus.  Now urine output has decreased and serum sodium has
   stabilized.
   - cont free water flushes per NG tube at 300 Q4H
   - restart tube feeds as procedure is deferred
   - daily sodium checks
   Acute Renal Failure:  ATN likely [**2-11**] hypotension resolving with Cr
   stable at 1.0-1.1.
   - blood pressure management as above
   - renal has signed off
   - UOP stable
   - renally dose medications, trend creatinine
   Anemia:  Hematocrit slowly downtrendig over past two weeks. Patient
   with two episodes of coffee ground emesis last week. Also one episode
   of perirectal bleeding thought [**2-11**] flexiseal irritation. B12, folate,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. The patient has undergone intubation due to an aspiration event. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has had worsening respiratory status requiring increased mechanical support due to apneic episodes. The long-term plan is for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

2. Elevated PTT: The elevated PTT is likely related to heparin sodium (Prophylaxis) started upon hospitalization. The plan is to discontinue the subcutaneous heparin.

3. Autonomic instability: The patient exhibits autonomic instability, likely secondary to neurological disease exacerbated when propofol is uptitrated. The plan is to continue metoprolol at 50mg QID with strict holding parameters and use hydralazine PRN for systolic blood pressures greater than 180.

   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. Off antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum cx negative. CXR notable for
   persistent atelectasis. Long term plan for trach but unable to do so
   until plavix has been off for seven days.  Over past 48 hours has had
   worsening respiratory status requiring increased mechanical support
   secondary to apneic episodes.  Unclear if this is related to neurologic
   disease. CXR with consolidations and small effusions.
   - plan for tracheostomy after seven days off plavix ([**2154-7-17**]) will
   confirm with inteventional pulmonary today that he is still on the
   schedule
   - will continue current ventilatory settings in preparation for trach
   (on MMV secondary to periods of apnea).
   - hyoscyamine discontinued as thickened secretions difficult to suction
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease
   exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. UOP sensitive to hypotension.
   - continue metoprolol to 50mg QID with strict holding parameters for

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has a history of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, which may be secondary to aspiration and pooling of secretions. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, requiring increased mechanical support due to apneic episodes. A chest X-ray shows consolidations and small effusions. The long-term plan is for a tracheostomy, but it cannot be performed until the patient has been off Plavix for seven days.

The patient also has autonomic instability, likely secondary to neurologic disease, exacerbated when propofol is uptitrated. There is evidence of leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, but the patient is afebrile since July 11th. Antibiotics have been discontinued as there are no positive microbiological results.

The patient's neurologic decline is attributed to encephalitis, with a negative GQ1B antibody test. A repeat lumbar puncture appears noninfectious, and cytology is negative for malignant cells. The patient has completed a five-day course of IVIG followed by a five-day course of high-dose steroids.

Hypernatremia has been elevated again due to free water flushes being held while the orogastric tube is out. The serum sodium has stabilized with decreased urine output. The plan is to continue free water flushes per NG tube and check daily sodium levels.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of aspiration, which resulted in pneumonia and respiratory failure. He requires mechanical ventilation support.

2. Autonomic instability: The patient is experiencing fluctuations in blood pressure, which may be related to his neurological disease. This requires close monitoring and management.

3. Neurologic decline: The patient initially presented with widespread encephalopathy, and further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause. His mental status and strength are slowly improving after completing a course of IVIG and high-dose steroids.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, likely due to free water flushes being held while the nasogastric tube was out. This could be secondary to post-ATN diuresis or diabetes insipidus. The plan is to provide free water flushes through the NG tube and monitor serum sodium levels.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. His serum creatinine levels are stable at 1.0-1.1, and renal dosing of medications should be adjusted accordingly.

6. Anemia: The patient's hemat"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event. There have been no signs of improvement since receiving IVIg and high-dose steroids. The patient's condition includes neurologic dysfunction, respiratory failure, and autonomic instability with hypertension and hypotension. He requires supportive ventilation and is unable to protect his airway due to brainstem dysfunction. The patient also has a history of CAD, for which he is temporarily off Plavix for a planned tracheostomy. His current medications include propofol, metoprolol, ASA, and statin therapy. He is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging reveals a negative RUE UENI for DVT.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
3. Stress ulcers
4. Autonomic instability leading to hypertension or hypotension
5. Aspiration events
6. Hemolysis due to blood transfusion
7. Infection due to prolonged use of indwelling lines or catheters
8. Poor glycemic control
9. Malnutrition due to inability to take oral feeds

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He has undergone intubation due to an aspiration event. There have been no signs of improvement since the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) and high-dose steroids. The patient's neurologic input is appreciated, and a plan to wean propofol as tolerated is discussed with neurology. An LP cytology is pending, and a repeat MRI brain is requested by neurology.

The patient's respiratory status is unable to protect his airway due to brainstem dysfunction. He will be taken off Plavix for a possible tracheostomy/peg tube placement, which has been rescheduled for tomorrow. Supportive ventilation (PS/MMV) will continue. The patient also experiences autonomic instability with hypertension/hypotension, and metoprolol will be continued.

There is a downtrending hematocrit (Hct) without clinical signs of bleeding. Previously, the patient had coffee-grounds from a nasogastric tube and was diagnosed with iron and folate deficiencies. Hemolysis labs are negative, and an appropriate bump with transfusion has been made. The patient is on MVI and FeSO4 supplementation.

Cardiovascular disease (CAD) management includes being off Plavix for the tracheostomy/peg tube placement, restarting post-procedure, and continuing ASA/beta blocker"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. Off antibiotics. [**7-10**] sputum cx negative. CXR notable for
   persistent atelectasis. Long term plan for trach but unable to do so
   until plavix has been off for seven days.  Over past 48 hours has had
   worsening respiratory status requiring increased mechanical support
   secondary to apneic episodes.  Unclear if this is related to neurologic
   disease. CXR with consolidations and small effusions.
   - plan for tracheostomy and PEG when PTT has come down
   - will continue current ventilatory settings in preparation for trach
   (on MMV secondary to periods of apnea).
   - hyoscyamine discontinued as thickened secretions difficult to suction
   - will start rehab screen post procedure
   Elevated PTT
 likely related to Heparin SQ as it started upon
   hospitalization
   - d/c sq heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis.
- He experienced an aspiration event, leading to intubation and the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.
- The patient's respiratory status has worsened over the past 48 hours, requiring increased mechanical support due to apneic episodes.
- There are plans for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) once the elevated PTT comes down.
- The elevated PTT is likely related to heparin SQ, which started upon hospitalization.
- The patient's autonomic instability is likely secondary to neurologic disease exacerbated when propofol uptitrated.
- The patient's neurologic decline is fluctuating, and he has completed a 5-day course of IVIG followed by five days of high-dose steroids.
- He has hypernatremia, acute renal failure (ATN), anemia, acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI), and thrush.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 133/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- His current medications include propofol, lansoprazole, metoprolol, hydralazine, and haldol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event. The patient has multiple medical complications including aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, elevated PTT, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, anemia, ACS with NSTEMI, thrush, hyperglycemia, and ICU care concerns such as nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event has led to the development of pneumonia. This condition can worsen if secretions continue to accumulate in the lungs, leading to further infection and respiratory distress.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to breathe independently due to the neurologic decline puts him at risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging, and there is a potential for prolonged ventilator dependency.
3. Elevated PTT: The patient's prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) indicates a potential bleeding disorder or the presence of anticoagulant medication. This increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially during invasive procedures.
4. Autonomic Instability: The patient's autonomic instability, characterized by fluctuations in blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output, may indicate an impaired regulation of vital functions. This can make hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He was intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, elevated PTT, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, anemia, ACS with NSTEMI, thrush, hyperglycemia, and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's aspiration event may lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure. Tracheostomy and PEG are planned when the PTT has come down.
2. Elevated PTT: The patient has an elevated PTT, which could be related to heparin SQ. It is important to monitor and manage this condition.
3. Autonomic Instability: The patient shows signs of autonomic instability, likely secondary to neurologic disease exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure is necessary.
4. Neurologic Decline: The patient has experienced a neurologic decline, and further evaluation and management are required.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be due to post-ATN diuresis of urea or diabetes insipidus. Appropriate fluid management and sodium checks are needed.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He has undergone an aspiration event and is currently intubated. There have been no signs of improvement since receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) and high-dose steroids. The patient's condition is concerning, as he is unable to protect his airway due to brainstem dysfunction. Repeat MRI brain results are pending. The patient is also experiencing autonomic instability, with fluctuations in blood pressure. Metoprolol is being used to manage this. Additionally, the patient's hematocrit levels are downtrending, and there may be signs of bleeding or possible hemolysis. Further evaluation and appropriate treatment are necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's inability to protect his airway and being on mechanical ventilation, he is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory infections.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's acute neurological decline suggests potential complications such as further deterioration in brain function, increased intracranial pressure, or development of new neurological deficits.
3. Bleeding complications: The downtrending hematocrit levels and previous coffee-ground aspirates indicate the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is important to monitor for any signs of internal bleeding and consider appropriate interventions.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's autonomic instability, characterized by episodes of hypertension and hypotension"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event. The patient has not shown signs of improvement since receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) and high-dose steroids. The neurology input is appreciated, and the plan is to wean propofol as tolerated. A repeat MRI brain has been requested, with the read pending.

The patient's respiratory condition is unstable, and he is unable to protect his airway due to brainstem dysfunction. The tracheostomy/peg tube placement has been deferred due to elevated PTT levels but is scheduled for today or tomorrow. Supportive ventilation with pressure support and mandatory minute volume (PS/MMV) will continue. The patient's autonomic instability, characterized by hypertension and hypotension, will be managed with metoprolol.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration is trending downwards, but there are no clinical signs of bleeding. Previously, he had coffee grounds from the nasogastric tube and was given iron (Fe) and folate supplements. Hemolysis labs have been negative, and an appropriate bump with transfusion has been administered. The patient is also receiving multivitamins (MVI) and ferrous sulfate (FeSO4).

Regarding the patient's cardiac history, he is temporarily off Plavix for the tracheostomy/peg tube"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications including aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, anemia, and ACS (acute coronary syndrome). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event has led to pneumonia, which can be a serious and potentially life-threatening condition if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory failure: Due to the aspiration event, the patient's respiratory function is compromised, requiring mechanical ventilation support. Respiratory failure can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, leading to further complications.
3. Autonomic instability: The patient's autonomic nervous system is unstable, likely secondary to neurologic disease. This can cause fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate, posing risks for organ perfusion and potential cardiovascular events.
4. Neurologic decline: The patient's neurological condition is deteriorating, possibly due to encephalitis. Continued decline may result in severe disability or even death.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological symptoms if not corrected properly.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, likely due to hypotension and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, anemia, and a history of ACS with NSTEMI. He also has thrush and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's frequent desats episodes resolved with suctioning, indicating a risk for recurrent aspiration events leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure.
2. Neurologic Disease: The patient's neurologic decline is likely secondary to encephalitis. There may be a risk of further neurological deterioration.
3. Autonomic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is sensitive to changes in medication, indicating potential autonomic instability. This could lead to episodes of hypotension or hypertension.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be due to post-ATN diuresis or diabetes insipidus. Proper management of fluid balance is crucial to prevent complications.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and blood pressure management is necessary.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. The patient has chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, altered mental status, fever, hypertension, anxiety, grieving, acute renal failure, and a history of myocardial infarction. The patient also has an inability to protect their airway.

The patient underwent an MRI of the brain, which showed no abnormal signal intensity within the brainstem or cerebellum. However, there was a subtle focus of increased FLAIR signal within the right internal auditory canal with enhancement, raising the possibility of a lesion involving cranial nerve VII or VIII, which could be related to the patient's symptoms of right facial droop. There were also multiple foci of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity within the subcortical white matter, which is a nonspecific finding and stable since the prior study. Additionally, there were areas of FLAIR hyperintensity within the cortical sulci and in the occipital lobes, which may have been artifactual on the prior study. The MRI also revealed panmucosal sinus disease, with nasopharyngeal secretions and increased fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has a history of chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypertension, anxiety, grieving, acute renal failure, and acute myocardial infarction. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has an endotracheal tube in place. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 89/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological exam shows equal and reactive pupils, movement of the right foot spontaneously, and withdrawal of all four extremities to painful stimuli but not to command. The MRI of the brain reveals no abnormal signal intensity or enhancement, but there is a subtle focus of increased FLAIR signal within the right internal auditory canal with enhancement, which raises the possibility of a lesion involving cranial nerve VII or VIII, potentially related to the patient's symptoms of right facial droop. Other findings include panmucosal sinus disease, multiple foci of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity within the subcortical white matter, and areas of FLAIR hyperintensity within the cortical sulci and in the occipital lobes, which may have been artifactual on the prior study. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count,"

   MRI BRAIN:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No abnormal signal intensity identified within the brainstem or
   cerebellum. There is no abnormal focus of parenchymal or meningeal
   enhancement.
   2. Subtle focus of increased FLAIR signal within the right internal
   auditory
   canal with enhancement that raises the possibility of a lesion
   involving the
   cranial nerve VII or VIII, and could be related to patient's symptoms
   of right
   facial droop.
   3. Multiple foci of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity within the subcortical
   white
   matter, which is a nonspecific finding, and is stable since the prior
   study.
   The areas of FLAIR hyperintensity within the cortical sulci and in the
   occipital lobes is not present on today's examination, and may have
   been
   artifactual on the prior study.

   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. Off antibiotics. CXR with consolidations and small
   effusions. [**7-10**] sputum cx negative. [**Month (only) 51**] have component of neurologic
   disease.
   - plan for tracheostomy and PEG when PTT has come down
   - will continue current ventilatory settings in preparation for trach
   (on MMV secondary to periods of apnea).
   - hyoscyamine discontinued as thickened secretions difficult to suction
   - rehab screen post-procedure
   Elevated PTT: Likely related to Heparin SQ as it started upon
   hospitalization
   - off SQ heparin
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease
   exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. UOP sensitive to hypotension.
   - Wean metoprolol to 50mg TID with strict holding parameters for now
   - hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   Neurologic decline: EEG on [**2154-7-5**] c/w widespread encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Thought to have [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis but

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. The patient has undergone an aspiration event and was intubated. He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's medical history includes a possible ACS (acute coronary syndrome) with NSTEMI, anemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and hyperglycemia. The patient has also been diagnosed with thrush and has had episodes of coffee ground emesis and perirectal bleeding.

The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, decreased blood pressure, and a slightly elevated heart rate. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and his oxygen saturation is good. The patient's neurological status has slowly improved after a 5-day course of IVIG and high-dose steroids.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal coagulation profile with prolonged PTT. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly elevated sodium levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation support.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and risk factors.
3. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has undergone several procedures including intubation, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a recent aspiration event and respiratory failure. He also has a history of anemia, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, autonomic instability, and a possible NSTEMI. Other medical conditions include diabetes insipidus, thrush, hyperglycemia, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event and respiratory failure indicate a risk for developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to PE.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent bleeding episodes and planned PEG placement increase"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He experienced an aspiration event and was intubated. The patient has not shown signs of improvement since receiving IVIg and high-dose steroids. The neuro team is being consulted for further input. Propofol can be weaned as tolerated. The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to brainstem dysfunction, making it difficult to protect his airway. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) to assist with nutrition and ventilation. The patient also has autonomic instability with episodes of hypertension and hypotension. Metoprolol will be continued to manage blood pressure. The patient's cardiac history of coronary artery disease (CAD) will be taken into consideration after restarting Plavix following the trach/PEG procedure. The patient's current medications include ASA, Zoloft, simvastatin, docusate, Peridex, propofol, Atrovent, lansoprazole, RISS, FeSO4, and metoprolol. The patient's allergies include eptifibatide. The most recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, high glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. An MRI brain was performed on 7/17, showing largely unremarkable results. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. Potential complications that can arise include further respiratory distress, infection due to the intubation and potential tracheostomy, autonomic instability leading to cardiovascular events, and complications related to the PEG procedure."

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He recently experienced an aspiration event and was intubated. There are no signs of improvement since receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) and high-dose steroids. Neurological input is appreciated, and the plan is to wean propofol as tolerated while discussing future plans and prognosis with neurology. The patient's respiratory status is critical as he is unable to protect his airway due to brainstem dysfunction. He is being supported with mechanical ventilation. The patient also has autonomic instability, with episodes of hypertension and hypotension, and will continue on metoprolol. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is currently off Plavix for a planned tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He will continue on ASA, beta-blocker, and statin medications. The plan is to transfer the patient to a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility after the tracheostomy and PEG procedures. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU."

   Disposition: ICU, screening for Rehab
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis, now post aspiration event and intubation. He has several medical complications including:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has an aspiration pneumonia with frequent desats that were resolved with suctioning. He also has rightward tracheal deviation on chest X-ray, suggesting right lower lobe atelectasis.

2. Autonomic instability: The patient has autonomic instability likely secondary to neurologic disease exacerbated when propofol was uptitrated. He is sensitive to hypotension and requires careful blood pressure management.

3. Neurologic decline: The patient has a neurologic decline with widespread encephalopathy on EEG, but no epileptiform features. He had negative results for GQ1B antibody and repeat LP, and flow cytometry showed a non-specific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile; cytology was negative for malignant cells. He received a 5-day course of both IVIG and high-dose steroids with nonspecific MRI findings. Neurologic exam is stable with any improvement likely to be observed on the scale of weeks.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely post-ATN diuresis of urea and insensible free water losses. Less likely component of diabetes insipidus. He is receiving D5W at 100 cc/h with plans to resume free water flushes at 300cc Q4H when PEG is ready to use.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to hypotension now resolved. Blood pressure management as above, and his UOP is stable. Renally dose medications, and trend creatinine.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia with unclear etiology for slow downtrend in Hct over 2 weeks. He had two episodes of coffee ground emesis as well as one episode of perirectal bleeding thought to be flexiseal irritation. B12, folate, iron labs were normal on 7/9; no evidence of hemolysis on 7/16. He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells on 7/16.

7. ACS: NSTEMI - The patient has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He is currently on aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker.

8. Thrush: The patient has thrush and is being treated with nystatin.

9. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia in the setting of high-dose steroids (now completed) and D5W. He requires titration of insulin sensitivity stabilizer (ISS) prn.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition via tube feeds, glycemic control with ISS, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has undergone an aspiration event and subsequent intubation. The patient is now presenting with multiple medical complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, likely secondary to pooling secretions. This has resulted in respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation.

2. Autonomic Instability: The patient is experiencing autonomic instability, which is likely secondary to neurologic disease exacerbated by propofol uptitration. This condition requires careful management of blood pressure and heart rate.

3. Neurologic Decline: The patient's neurological decline is attributed to encephalitis. Initial tests, including EEG, CSF analysis, and flow cytometry, have shown nonspecific findings. Further investigations, such as MRI, have revealed nonspecific results. Improvement is expected to be observed on a scale of weeks.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis of urea and insensible free water losses. Diabetes insipidus is less likely. The patient is receiving D5W at 100 cc/h to correct the sodium imbalance.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to ATN caused by hypotension. Blood pressure management is crucial, along with monitoring urine output and trending"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and encephalitis. He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) yesterday. The patient has been improving with chest physiotherapy and deep suctioning. However, there are potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's brainstem dysfunction, he is unable to protect his airway. There is a risk of further respiratory collapse and the need for continued supportive ventilation. Regular chest physiotherapy and suctioning will be necessary to clear airways.

2. Autonomic Instability: The patient is experiencing episodes of hypertension and hypotension, indicating autonomic instability. Metoprolol will be continued to manage this condition.

3. Cardiovascular Disease (CAD): The patient's CAD is stable, but ongoing management with aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin is required. Once the peri-tracheal oozing subsides, Plavix can be resumed.

4. Tracheostomy Complications: Although the patient has improved with tracheostomy, there is a risk of ongoing bleeding at the tracheostomy site. Local care and resumption of heparin will be necessary.

5. Encephalitis and Neurological Decline: The patient's acute neurological decline is attributed to brainstem encephalitis. There has been no signs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has a history of aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, renal failure, hypernatremia, anemia, and a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He also received bronchoscopy due to decreased breath sounds on the right, revealing significant thick secretions in all lobes with gram-negative diplococci. The patient was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory difficulties due to aspiration of secretions and pooling. Monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory status, such as decreased oxygen saturation or increased work of breathing, is crucial.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if there is ongoing hypotension or further damage to the kidneys. Close monitoring of renal function and blood pressure is necessary.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be carefully managed to avoid complications such as seizures or neurologic damage. Daily sodium checks and adjustments in fluid administration are important.
4. Anemia: Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the patient's anemia. Close monitoring of hem"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurologic decline, currently attributed to encephalitis. He has multiple medical complications including aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, anemia, and coronary artery disease with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (ACS: NSTEMI).

Summary:
- The patient underwent bronchoscopy and revealed significant thick secretions in all lobes, with gram stain showing 1+ gram-negative diplococci.
- He was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
- His vital signs are stable, but he has had episodes of fever and hypertension.
- The patient has altered mental status and is at risk for aspiration.
- He has hypernatremia and acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypotension.
- Anemia is present, with unclear etiology, and the patient has a history of ACS: NSTEMI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation and thick secretions seen during bronchoscopy.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Due to immobility and central venous catheter placement.
3. Nosocomial infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has several medical complications.

The patient's recent events include bronchoscopy, BAL fluid culture, and EEG, which were performed to investigate the cause of the altered mental status. The bronchoscopy revealed significant thick secretions in all lobes, and the gram stain showed 1+ gram-negative diplococci. The patient has been started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin to treat the suspected pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 120/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's laboratory results show renal failure with an elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL and a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The patient also has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 142 mEq/L, altered mental status, fever, hypertension, anxiety, and myocardial infarction."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications and conditions include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient had an aspiration event and was intubated. They developed respiratory failure due to aspiration of pooling secretions. The CXR showed consolidations and small effusions.

2. Neurologic decline: The patient has experienced a decline in mental status attributed to encephalitis. They underwent a 5-day course of IVIG and high-dose steroids. An MRI showed nonspecific findings.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels are likely due to post-ATN diuresis of urea and insensible free water losses.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has ATN, which is now resolved. Blood pressure management is crucial.

5. Anemia: The cause of the downtrend in Hct is unclear. The patient had episodes of coffee ground emesis and perirectal bleeding. B12, folate, and iron levels were normal, and there were no signs of hemolysis.

6. Autonomic instability: The patient exhibits autonomic instability likely secondary to neurologic disease. Propofol uptitration worsens this condition.

7. Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient is being treated with ASA, statin, and beta-blocker.

8. Thrush: The patient requires treatment with nystatin.

9. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. The patient has undergone intubation due to an aspiration event and has had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placed on July 19th.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/74 to 173/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest and bilateral peripheral edema. Neurologically, the patient is sedated and not fully assessed. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), and slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is being treated with aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins. The patient also has diabetes and is being managed with insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event and has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient's condition remains unchanged since receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) and high-dose steroids. Neurological input is appreciated, and plans for future management and prognosis will be discussed. The patient has mucous plugging and presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Chest physiotherapy and deep suctioning have been performed for right middle lobe/right lower lobe collapse. Local care is provided for continued oozing at the tracheostomy site, and antibiotics have been started. Autonomic instability with hypertension and hypotension continues, and metoprolol is being continued. Cardiovascular assessment remains stable, and the patient's medications for coronary artery disease (CAD) will be continued. Disposition includes plans for long-term acute care hospital (LTAC) placement after tracheostomy/PEG. The patient's nutritional support is adequate, and glycemic control is well-managed. Prophylactic measures include low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcers, and elevation of head of bed (HOB) for VAP prevention."

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on 7/19.

The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. However, his hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased from 24.5 on 7/20 to 22.0 on 7/22. The platelet count is also low at 32,000/microliter.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's frequent desaturations were resolved with suctioning, and a chest X-ray revealed consolidations and small effusions. Sputum cultures have been negative.

2. Autonomic instability: The patient's blood pressure is sensitive to hypotension, especially when propofol is uptitrated. He is currently on metoprolol and hydralazine for blood pressure management.

3. Neurologic decline: The patient's neurologic exam remains stable, but any improvement is expected to be observed over weeks. EEG results showed widespread encephalopathy, and repeat LP was negative for infection. Flow cytometry revealed a non-specific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Still no read on EEG
   - Restarted Plavix and SQ heparin, but still oozing in PM with clots
   around trach so plavix and SQ heparin held again.  IP stopped by and
   recommended silver nitrate stick TP. If that doesn't work, can try
   sub-Q Epinephrine 1:1000 for vasoconstriction.
   - Hct dropped to 22, but by then we acheived hemostasis with silver

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. The patient has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing concerns such as aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, anemia, ACS (NSTEMI), thrush, and hyperglycemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and lung infections.

2. Neurological Decline: The patient has acute neurological decline, which could progress further, leading to increased disability or even death. The underlying cause of the encephalitis needs to be identified and managed accordingly.

3. Autonomic Instability: The patient exhibits autonomic instability, which may contribute to fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. This instability can lead to hypotension or hypertension, compromising organ perfusion.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is a high level of sodium in the blood. This condition can lead to dehydration, neurological complications, and electrolyte imbalances.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. Neurologic decline: The patient has experienced an acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. There have been ongoing efforts to identify the cause, including negative results for GQ1B antibody and cytology for malignant cells. The patient underwent a 5-day course of IVIG and high-dose steroids, with nonspecific MRI findings. Neurologic improvement is expected to be observed on a scale of weeks.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient had an aspiration event leading to intubation and tracheostomy placement. There is a concern for mucous plugging due to thick secretions, and gram-negative diplococci were found on gram stain from bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial washings. Cultures are pending. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin) and assisted ventilation to open the lungs.

3. Autonomic instability: The patient is experiencing autonomic instability likely secondary to neurologic disease, which worsens when propofol is uptitrated. The patient's urine output is sensitive to hypotension. The treatment plan includes continuing metoprolol and using hydralazine as needed for systolic blood pressures above 180.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to an inability to protect their airway. They have a history of renal failure, hypernatremia, hypertension, anxiety, and a recent myocardial infarction. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and slightly elevated glucose levels. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,523 mL and output of 1,590 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,933 mL. The patient's respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with a set tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI of 40. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.4, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, and PaO2 of 126 mg/dL.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He has undergone intubation and tracheostomy, as well as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including sedatives, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/63 mmHg to 146/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. However, the patient has elevated blood glucose levels, potassium, and phosphorus. 

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, anemia, and hypertension. 

The patient's recent events include tracheostomy and PEG placement on [**7-19**], aspiration event leading to intubation, and brainstem encephalitis. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include weaning off propofol as tolerated, discussing future plan/prognosis with neurology, and addressing respiratory issues such as mucous plugging and presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further neurological decline, respiratory infections, bleeding due to anticoagulant use,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has had an aspiration event and is currently intubated. The patient's medical conditions include aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, anemia, ACS (NSTEMI), thrush, hyperglycemia, and unknown allergies.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of developing further respiratory complications due to aspiration, such as pneumonia or worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary.

2. Autonomic Instability: The patient's autonomic instability may lead to fluctuations in blood pressure, heart rate, and other vital signs. Strict blood pressure management and close monitoring of vital signs are required to prevent complications such as hypotension or hypertension.

3. Neurologic Decline: The patient's neurologic decline can result in further cognitive impairment, difficulty with communication, and potential neurological deficits. Regular neurologic assessments and follow-up with neurology are essential.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential neurological complications. Close monitoring of sodium levels and appropriate fluid management will be necessary.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis, who has experienced an aspiration event and subsequent intubation. The patient's conditions include aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, anemia, ACS (acute coronary syndrome) NSTEMI, thrush, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 176/83 to 137/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia, metoprolol for autonomic instability, hydralazine for high blood pressure, fentanyl for pain, and IVIG and steroids for neurologic decline. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive fluid balance of 4734 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The blood cultures show the presence of gram-negative diplococci. Imaging reveals persistent lower lobe collapse, possibly with resolution of right middle lobe collapse, and no pneumothorax.

The patient's plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, increasing positive end-expiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis.
- He had an aspiration event leading to intubation and is now on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on [**7-19**].
- He is currently on antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
- The patient has shown improvement in right middle lobe collapse but still has persistent lower lobe collapse.
- He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.
- The patient's autonomic instability is likely secondary to neurological disease exacerbated by propofol uptitration.
- His neurologic decline has improved after receiving IVIG and high-dose steroids.
- The patient is at risk for hypernatremia due to post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis and insensible free water losses.
- He also has acute renal failure, which is likely due to hypotension that has now resolved.
- Anemia of unclear etiology has been observed, possibly related to gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient has a history of ACS (acute coronary syndrome) with NSTEMI, for which he is receiving appropriate cardiac medications.
- He is also at risk for thrush, hyperglycemia, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He has undergone several interventions including intubation, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure due to right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia, encephalitis, hypertension (HTN), and possible anemia related to tracheostomy site oozing.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation make him at risk for developing VAP. The physician has ordered a chest physical therapy (PT) and deep suctioning for right middle lobe/right lower lobe (RML/RLL) collapse, suggesting a concern for this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin as prophylaxis for DVT. This indicates a concern for the development of blood clots, which can lead to DVT.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia may be related to tracheostomy site oozing. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further blood loss and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to encephalitis and prolonged ICU stay puts"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurologic decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He has undergone intubation due to an aspiration event, and has had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placed. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening lung infection. Adequate suctioning of the tracheostomy tube and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be continued to prevent DVT.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility puts him at risk for developing pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessments and repositioning are important to prevent pressure ulcers.
4. Aspiration events: The patient's swallowing function should be evaluated to determine if he is at risk for further aspiration events. Appropriate measures to protect the airway should be implemented.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a PEG tube in place, which carries a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and maintaining strict adherence to proper PEG tube care are important."

   the contour of the right hemidiaphragm is now well seen. In the now
   ventilated right lung bases, a limited area of opacities becomes
   visible. The
   opacity contains multiple air bronchograms. This change could
   correspond to
   re-expansion edema or a recent infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event. The patient has multiple medical problems including aspiration pneumonia/respiratory failure, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, anemia, ACS/NSTEMI, thrush, and hyperglycemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's risk factors include being intubated for an extended period, having a tracheostomy, and being in the ICU. The presence of opacities with air bronchograms on the chest X-ray could indicate a recent infection or re-expansion edema.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at risk for DVT/PE due to immobility, central venous catheter placement, and a history of ACS/NSTEMI.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had episodes of coffee ground emesis and perirectal bleeding, which could be indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and there is a need to monitor renal function"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He is currently receiving cefepime and ciprofloxacin for a ten-day course. The patient's mental status has improved after a five-day course of IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and high-dose steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory parameters is essential.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which could be due to post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis of urea and insensible free water losses. Frequent monitoring of sodium levels and free water flushes are recommended.
3. Anemia: The patient has a declining hemoglobin (Hct) level, which may be caused by gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigation into the cause of anemia is warranted, including checking for any signs of hemolysis.
4. Autonomic instability: The patient exhibits autonomic instability, likely secondary to neurologic disease. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with medications such as metoprolol and hydralazine are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including hypernatremia, fever, hypertension, and an inability to protect their airway. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, heparin, and fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's inability to protect their airway and the presence of an endotracheal tube, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is described as altered rather than delirious, it is important to monitor for signs of delirium, which can include confusion, agitation, and hallucinations.
3. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate a potential hypertensive crisis. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure are necessary to prevent complications such as stroke or cardiac issues.
4. Infection: The presence of fever and localized opacities on the chest X-ray suggests the possibility of an infection, which could be due to pneumonia or another source. Monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies is important to identify and treat any infections promptly.
5. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's high sodium levels indicate hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Close"

   As compared to the previous radiograph, the tracheostomy tube is in

   resolved,
   the contour of the right hemidiaphragm is now well seen. In the now
   ventilated right lung bases, a limited area of opacities becomes
   visible. The
   opacity contains multiple air bronchograms. This change could
   correspond to
   re-expansion edema or a recent infection.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis, who had an aspiration event leading to intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration and pooling secretions. He has been on cefepime and ciprofloxacin for a ten-day course.

The patient also has autonomic instability, likely due to neurological disease exacerbated when propofol was uptitrated. His blood pressure is sensitive to hypotension, so he is on metoprolol and hydralazine as needed for SBPs > 180.

The patient has experienced a neurologic decline, which improved with IVIG and high-dose steroids. Anemia of unclear etiology has been observed, and the patient has received one unit of packed red blood cells. Hypernatremia is suspected to be due to post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis of urea and insensible free water losses.

The patient is also diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely secondary to ATN from hypotension. He is being managed with blood pressure control and monitoring of renal function.

Additionally, the patient has a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is on aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, and Plavix.

The patient's condition has been complicated by thrush, hyperglycemia, and hypernatremia."

   resolved,
   the contour of the right hemidiaphragm is now well seen. In the now
   ventilated right lung bases, a limited area of opacities becomes
   visible. The
   opacity contains multiple air bronchograms. This change could
   correspond to
   re-expansion edema or a recent infection.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He had an aspiration event and was intubated. He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient has multiple comorbidities including anemia, acute renal failure, hypertension, hypernatremia, and a history of NSTEMI. He is currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, and thrush.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to protect his airway and frequent desats indicate a risk for aspiration pneumonia and subsequent respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and continued suctioning as needed are essential.

2. Infection: The presence of gram-negative diplococci in bronchoalveolar lavage and oropharyngeal flora suggests a possible bacterial infection. The patient is already on antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and lab results is necessary to detect any worsening infection.

3. Autonomic Instability: The patient exhibits autonomic instability likely secondary to neurologic disease. This can lead to fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate management of blood pressure with hydralazine PRN and metoprolol 50mg are required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He underwent intubation after an aspiration event, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. The patient's current condition includes presumed brainstem encephalitis, tracheostomy with mucous plugging and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anemia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and fluctuating blood pressure. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a FiO2 of 50%. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and normal kidney function.

Potential Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory status and the presence of mucous plugging suggest a possible VAP. It is crucial to monitor his oxygen saturation, chest X-ray, and other respiratory parameters closely.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's history of coffee-grounds emesis from a nasogastric tube raises concerns about GIB. Close monitoring of stool color, hemodynamic stability, and further investigation if necessary are recommended.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Regular lower extremity assessments and"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He has undergone several procedures, including intubation, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Mucous plugging and presumed VAP have already been noted on day 5.
2. Aspiration events: Given the patient's neurologic decline and impaired swallowing reflex, there is a risk of aspiration, especially since he is intubated.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of coffee-grounds emesis from a nasogastric tube, which raises concerns about possible GIB. Anemia is present, and the patient is receiving a blood transfusion.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, are being implemented.
5. Hospital-acquired infections: Due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is an increased risk of acquiring hospital-acquired infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and catheter-related urinary tract infections (CAUTI)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with respiratory failure, right lower lobe pneumonia, and encephalitis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has had several events including recurrent mucous plugging and aspiration. He has received intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) and high-dose steroids for presumed brainstem encephalitis. The patient's mental status has improved, and he is now following some commands. He has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed. His respiratory status has been complicated by mucous plugging and a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan includes weaning from the ventilator, repeating a chest X-ray, and monitoring for atelectasis. The patient also has anemia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease, and his disposition is planned for a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed mucous plugging and presumed VAP. This can lead to worsening lung infection and respiratory failure.
2. Aspiration: The patient has had aspiration events, which can result in further lung damage and increase the risk of VAP.
3. Brainstem encephalitis: The patient has presumed brainstem encephalitis, which can lead to neurological complications and potential long-term disability"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is of concern due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. He requires assist-control ventilation with plans for slow weaning at a long-term acute care hospital (LTAC).

2. Autonomic Instability: The patient exhibits autonomic instability, likely secondary to neurological disease exacerbated when propofol was uptitrated. Blood pressure management includes metoprolol and hydralazine as needed.

3. Neurologic Decline: The patient has a history of encephalitis, but the specific cause is unclear. Initial investigations including EEG, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and flow cytometry were inconclusive. The patient has received a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and high-dose steroids, resulting in neurological improvement.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have been trending down over the past two weeks. Possible causes include gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by episodes of coffee ground emesis and perirectal bleeding. The patient has received two units of blood transfusion with initial improvement"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on 07/19. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration and pooling of secretions. He was placed on mechanical ventilation (vent) on 07/24 due to increased somnolence and respiratory acidosis.

Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory condition is thought to be secondary to aspiration and pooling of secretions. Frequent desats events were resolved with suctioning, indicating the need for ongoing management.
2. Autonomic Instability: The patient is experiencing autonomic instability, likely secondary to neurologic disease exacerbated when propofol was uptitrated. He requires careful blood pressure management.
3. Neurologic Decline: The patient initially presented with widespread encephalopathy, but subsequent tests including EEG, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, flow cytometry, and MRI did not reveal any specific cause for his neurologic decline. He was treated with IVIG and high-dose steroids, leading to improvement in neurologic function.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have been trending downwards over the past two weeks. Possible causes include gastrointestinal bleeding or irritation from the PEG tube. He received two blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He is also receiving cefepime and ciprofloxacin for a suspected infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced an aspiration event leading to respiratory acidosis and subsequent intubation. He is being treated with antibiotics and suctioning to clear secretions.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have been decreasing over the past two weeks, indicating anemia. Despite receiving blood transfusions, his hematocrit remains low. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient is likely experiencing hypernatremia due to post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis of urea and insensible free water losses. This may be exacerbated by diabetes insipidus. Management includes increasing free water flushes and monitoring sodium levels.

4. Autonomic Instability: The patient exhibits autonomic instability, which may be secondary to neurologic disease. This is exacerbated when propofol is uptitrated. Management involves controlling blood pressure with metoprolol and hydralazine.

5. Neurologic Decline: The patient's neurologic decline is thought to be due to encephalitis. Initial tests, including EEG, LP, and flow cytometry, have yielded nonspecific results. The patient has completed a 5-day course of IVIG and high-dose steroids, resulting in improvement of neurologic symptoms.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has ATN, possibly related to hypotension. Management includes blood pressure control and monitoring of renal function.

7. ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome): The patient had an NSTEMI and is being managed with ASA, statin, and beta-blocker therapy. Plavix has been held as the patient underwent stent placement.

8. Thrush: The patient has developed thrush, for which nystatin treatment has been initiated.

9. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may be related to high-dose steroids, which have since been completed. Insulin supplementation is being titrated as needed.

ICU Care:
The patient is receiving appropriate nutrition and glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP bundle implementation."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. 

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is described as altered, with increased secretions and somnolence when placed on the vent. This could indicate a potential brain injury or other neurological issues.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to dehydration or an imbalance in fluid and electrolyte management. This condition can lead to neurological symptoms and complications if not managed properly.

3. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be a sign of infection or inflammation in the body. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of the fever.

4. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure, specifically malignant hypertension, which is a severe form of hypertension that requires immediate medical attention. If left untreated, it can lead to organ damage and other complications.

5. Airway Inability: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to an altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance. This increases the risk of pneumonia and other respiratory infections.

6. Hypercapnea: The patient has hypercapnea, which is an increased level of carbon dioxide in the blood. This can be caused by respiratory issues or inadequate ventilation support.

7. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been decreasing, indicating a possible development of anemia. Further evaluation is required to determine the cause and severity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to an aspiration event and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He is being treated for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, with antibiotics (cefepime and ciprofloxacin) and plans for slow weaning at a long-term acute care hospital (LTAC). Other medical complications include autonomic instability, neurologic decline, anemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI), thrush, and hyperglycemia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging, and there is a risk of reintubation if spontaneous breathing is inadequate.
2. Neurologic Disease: The patient's neurological condition is complex, with widespread encephalopathy and potential encephalitis. There may be ongoing neurologic decline, and monitoring for seizures is necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient has a declining hematocrit, indicating anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, and transfusion may be required.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's recent events include an aspiration event while on ventilator support, resulting in increased somnolence and respiratory acidosis. He has been placed on cefepime and ciprofloxacin for a ten-day course. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly in the respiratory tract due to the tracheostomy and PEG tubes. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or odor is important.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are ongoing issues with secretion management, mucous plugging, or if the underlying neurologic condition deteriorates.

3. Autonomic Instability: The patient has a history of autonomic instability, which could lead to fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate management with medications like metoprolol and hydralazine is necessary.

4. Neurologic Decline: Although the patient's neurologic status has improved with treatment, there is still a risk of further decline. Regular neurologic assessments and follow-up with neurology"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He was intubated due to an aspiration event and has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on July 19th. The patient's mental status has shown continued improvement, and he is now following some commands. He is receiving fentanyl for pain and olanzapine for agitation. A physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal vital signs and respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with assisted ventilation. Laboratory results show low hemoglobin levels, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, chronic anemia, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory status may be at risk due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation. Regular chest physiotherapy and deep suctioning are recommended to prevent VAP.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of coffee-grounds emesis and anemia of chronic disease, which raises concerns for GIB. Further investigation and management are required to address this potential complication.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheterization increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to brainstem encephalitis. He underwent intubation after an aspiration event. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on July 19th. He is currently being treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) and high-dose steroids for presumed brainstem encephalitis.

The patient's mental status has shown continued improvement, and he is now following some commands. He is being given prn fentanyl for pain and zyprexa for agitation. A physical examination reveals no acute distress, with the presence of tracheostomy tube and normal bowel sounds. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 71 to 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74 to 158 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 11 to 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.7 g/dL and a hematocrit of 20.7%. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 13.0 K/uL, and platelet count is within normal range at 53 K/uL. Blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.37.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. S/p trach/PEG on [**7-19**]. Concern for mucous plugging on [**7-19**]
   given thick secretions; [**7-20**] BAL and bronch washings with gram neg
   diplococci on gram stain, cx with OP Flora x2. [**Month (only) 51**] also have component
   from neurologic disease.  Yesterday placed on [**5-14**] with increased
   somnolence and respiratory acidosis on ABG but improved this AM.
   - Currently on cefepime and ciprofloxacin for ten day course (day 1
   [**2154-7-20**])
   - continue MMV given persistent episodes of apnea while on pressure
   support
   - continue suction, chest PT
   - fentanyl boluses for pain post-trach/PEG
   - cont rehab screeen for d/c
   Anemia:  Unclear etiology for slow downtrend in Hct over 2 weeks. Did
   have two episodes of coffee ground emesis as well as one episode of
   perirectal bleeding thought [**2-11**] flexiseal irritation. B12, folate, iron
   labs nl on [**7-9**]; no e/o hemolysis on [**7-16**]. Received 1 unit [**2154-7-16**] and
   [**2154-7-24**] with initially appropriate hematocrit bump from 20.7 to 24.3
   but down again this morning to 20.4.  No clear active sources of
   bleeding although has had trend of increased hematocrit drop since
   restarting plavix and heparin.   Continues to be grossly guaiac
   positive on exam.
   - change famotidine to lansoprazole [**Hospital1 **]
   - check hemolysis labs
   - continue iron supplements and multivitamin
   - active T&S, will transfuse 2 units for < 21
   - will check PM hct

   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline currently attributed to
   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with

   given thick secretions; [**7-20**] BAL and bronch washings with gram neg
   diplococci on gram stain, cx with OP Flora x2. [**Month (only) 51**] also have component
   from neurologic disease.  Yesterday placed on [**5-14**] with increased
   somnolence and respiratory acidosis on ABG but improved this AM.
   - Currently on cefepime and ciprofloxacin for ten day course (day 1
   [**2154-7-20**])
   - will place back on assist control today given GI bleeding
   - continue suction, chest PT
   - fentanyl boluses for pain post-trach/PEG
   - cont rehab screeen for d/c
   Anemia:  Unclear etiology for slow downtrend in Hct over 2 weeks. Did
   have two episodes of coffee ground emesis as well as one episode of
   perirectal bleeding thought [**2-11**] flexiseal irritation. B12, folate, iron
   labs nl on [**7-9**]; no e/o hemolysis on [**7-16**]. Received 1 unit [**2154-7-16**] and
   [**2154-7-24**] with initially appropriate hematocrit bump from 20.7 to 24.3
   but down again this morning to 20.4.  No clear active sources of
   bleeding although has had trend of increased hematocrit drop since
   restarting plavix and heparin.   Continues to be grossly guaiac
   positive on exam.
   - continue lansoprazole [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue iron supplements and multivitamin
   - active T&S, will transfuse 2 units for < 21
   - d/c heparin and plavix
   - GI consult today for upper endoscopy
   Hypernatremia:  Likely [**2-11**] post-ATN diuresis of urea and insensible
   free water losses. Less likely component of diabetes insipidus. Unclear
   why patient has had worsening of his hypernatremia over the past 24
   hours.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   - increase free water flushes to 300cc Q4H via PEG
   - will start D5W
   - PM sodium check
   - hold tube feeds pending upper endoscopy
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease
   exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. UOP sensitive to hypotension.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   Critical Care:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He remains diaphoretic even on MMV support. ABG
s reveal a chronic resp
   acidosis. He has a dropping Hct and rising BUN and serum sodium. His
   secretion output is copious but frothy and no longer purulent.
   We will request GI input for EGD but have low threshold to perform CT
   of abdomen if EGD does reveal signs of ongoing blood loss ( r/o rectus
   sheath hematoma or RP bleed).  We will transfuse to keep Hct above 27
   at all times. In the meantime we will allow him to rest on
   ACVentilation for now. Free water bolus will be ongoing and if needs
   greater than 4 L D5W to keep up with correction of Na, we will start
   workup for DI ( central). LTAC transfer on hold till acute issue have
   been sorted out
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on a ventilator and has been experiencing frequent desaturations that have been resolved with suctioning. He has also been on cefepime and ciprofloxacin for ten days.

The patient has anemia with unclear etiology, characterized by a downtrend in hematocrit over two weeks. He has had episodes of coffee ground emesis and perirectal bleeding. He received two units of packed red blood cells, but his hematocrit levels continue to drop. He is guaiac positive on examination, and there are no clear active sources of bleeding. He is on lansoprazole, iron supplements, and multivitamins.

The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia, likely due to post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis and insensible water losses. His sodium levels have worsened over the past 24 hours, and he may have gastrointestinal bleeding contributing to this condition. He is receiving free water flushes via PEG and will start D5W.

There are concerns about autonomic instability, likely secondary to neurological disease exacerbated by propofol. His urine output is sensitive to hypotension. He is on metoprolol and"

   [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis now s/p aspiration event and intubation.
   Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Thought to be secondary to
   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. S/p trach/PEG on [**7-19**]. Concern for mucous plugging on [**7-19**]
   given thick secretions; [**7-20**] BAL and bronch washings with gram neg
   diplococci on gram stain, cx with OP Flora x2. [**Month (only) 51**] also have component
   from neurologic disease.  Yesterday placed on [**5-14**] with increased
   somnolence and respiratory acidosis on ABG but improved this AM.
   - Currently on cefepime and ciprofloxacin for ten day course (day 1
   [**2154-7-20**])
   - continue MMV given persistent episodes of apnea while on pressure
   support
   - continue suction, chest PT
   - fentanyl boluses for pain post-trach/PEG
   - cont rehab screeen for d/c
   Anemia:  Unclear etiology for slow downtrend in Hct over 2 weeks. Did
   have two episodes of coffee ground emesis as well as one episode of
   perirectal bleeding thought [**2-11**] flexiseal irritation. B12, folate, iron
   labs nl on [**7-9**]; no e/o hemolysis on [**7-16**]. Received 1 unit [**2154-7-16**] and
   [**2154-7-24**] with initially appropriate hematocrit bump from 20.7 to 24.3
   but down again this morning to 20.4.  No clear active sources of
   bleeding although has had trend of increased hematocrit drop since
   restarting plavix and heparin.   Continues to be grossly guaiac
   positive on exam.

   - continue iron supplements and multivitamin
   - active T&S, will transfuse 2 units for < 21
   - d/c heparin and plavix
   - GI consult today for upper endoscopy
   Hypernatremia:  Likely [**2-11**] post-ATN diuresis of urea and insensible
   free water losses. Less likely component of diabetes insipidus. Unclear
   why patient has had worsening of his hypernatremia over the past 24
   hours.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   - increase free water flushes to 300cc Q2H via PEG
   - will check PM sodium, if not decreasing will start D5W

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and a history of myocardial infarction. The patient has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, and difficulty breathing. On 7/24 at 12:57 PM, the patient's temperature was 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate was 101 bpm, blood pressure was 157/69 mmHg, respiratory rate was 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 100%. The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results showed a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 66 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 230.

The patient's vital signs remained relatively stable throughout the day, with occasional spikes in blood pressure. The patient's respiratory support was adjusted several times, with periods of apnea prompting the return to mandatory minute ventilation (MMV). The patient received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) due to a positive stool guaiac test, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate"

   Anemia:  Unclear etiology for slow downtrend in Hct over 2 weeks. Did
   have two episodes of coffee ground emesis as well as one episode of
   perirectal bleeding thought [**2-11**] flexiseal irritation. B12, folate, iron
   labs nl on [**7-9**]; no e/o hemolysis on [**7-16**]. Received 1 unit [**2154-7-16**] and
   [**2154-7-24**] with initially appropriate hematocrit bump from 20.7 to 24.3
   but down again this morning to 20.4.  No clear active sources of
   bleeding although has had trend of increased hematocrit drop since
   restarting plavix and heparin.   Continues to be grossly guaiac
   positive on exam.
   - continue lansoprazole [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue iron supplements and multivitamin
   - active T&S, will transfuse 2 units for < 21
   - d/c heparin and plavix
   - GI consult today for upper endoscopy
   Hypernatremia:  Likely [**2-11**] post-ATN diuresis of urea and insensible
   free water losses. Less likely component of diabetes insipidus. Unclear
   why patient has had worsening of his hypernatremia over the past 24
   hours.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   - increase free water flushes to 300cc Q2H via PEG
   - will check PM sodium, if not decreasing will start D5W
   - continue tube feeds
   Autonomic instability: Likely secondary to neurologic disease
   exacerbated when propofol uptitrated. UOP sensitive to hypotension.
   - cont metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] with strict holding parameters
   - hydralazine PRN for SBPs > 180
   Neurologic decline: EEG on [**2154-7-5**] c/w widespread encephalopathy but no
   epileptiform features. Thought to have [**Last Name (un) 8413**] encephalitis but
   GQ1B Ab neg. Repeat LP [**2154-7-10**] cx neg. Flow cytometry with non-specific
   T cell dominant lymphoid profile; cytology neg for malignant cells. Now

   MRI finding. Neuro significantly improved, following commands, alert.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - fentanyl prn for pain
   - zydis PRN for agitation
   Acute Renal Failure:  ATN likely [**2-11**] hypotension now resolved.
   - blood pressure management as above
   - UOP stable
   - renally dose medications, trend creatinine
   ACS: NSTEMI
   - cont ASA, statin, beta blocker
   - hold plavix as stent placed [**1-16**]
   Thrush: nystatin

The patient is being treated for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure with cefepime and ciprofloxacin. He is on mechanical ventilation support with pressure control mode ventilation (PCV) and has had episodes of apnea, so he is also on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's recent ABG results show respiratory acidosis. He is being given fentanyl boluses for pain post-tracheostomy/PEG tube placement. The patient's anemia is of unclear etiology with a downtrend in hematocrit over two weeks. He has received blood transfusions but continues to be grossly guaiac positive on examination. His hypernatremia may be secondary to post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis of urea and insensible free water losses. The patient is also experiencing autonomic instability likely secondary to neurological disease exacerbated when propofol was uptitrated. He has a history of acute renal failure, ACS (acute coronary syndrome) with NSTEMI, thrush, hyperglycemia, and depression. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, steroids, beta-blockers, and statins"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status and fever. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired motor function, and impaired transfers. The patient also has hypernatremia, fever, hypertension, and an inability to protect their airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's impaired airway clearance and inability to protect their airway put them at risk for aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia. The presence of bibasilar consolidation on imaging may indicate aspiration.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and altered mental status can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary is important.
5. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate a potential hypertensive crisis. Close monitoring and management are required to prevent complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy or aortic dissection.
6. Hypernatremia: The"

   Disposition : ICU for today
","Based on the provided information, the patient's progress note indicates that they have been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The summary of the note is as follows:

- The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis.
- He has a history of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be secondary to aspiration and pooling secretions. However, it may also be related to neurologic disease.
- The patient has been placed on assist control ventilation and is receiving antibiotics (cefepime and ciprofloxacin) for a ten-day course.
- He has anemia with an unclear etiology, despite receiving blood transfusions. There are no clear active sources of bleeding, but he has had a trend of increased hematocrit drop since restarting Plavix and heparin. He is guaiac positive on examination.
- The patient is hypernatremic, likely due to post-ATN diuresis of urea and insensible free water losses. There is a concern for worsening hypernatremia over the past 24 hours, possibly secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Autonomic instability is present, likely secondary to neurologic disease exacerbated by propofol uptitrations.
- The patient has had a neurologic decline, which is thought to be due to encephalitis. However, further testing has ruled out GQ1B Ab and cytology for malignant cells.
- Acute renal failure is suspected, possibly due to hypotension. Renal dosing of medications and monitoring creatinine levels are important.
- The patient had an ACS (acute coronary syndrome) with NSTEMI, for which he is on ASA, statin, and beta-blocker. Plavix was held after stent placement.
- Thrush is being treated with nystatin.
- Hyperglycemia was managed with insulin sliding scale.
- The patient is being treated for depression with celexa.
- In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition is being managed with fiber supplementation, glycemic control is being monitored, and prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and VAP bundle implementation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's impaired airway clearance and aspiration events put him at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac positive status indicates gastrointestinal bleeding, which may worsen his anemia and hypernatremia.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure needs close monitoring, and any deterioration in renal function could lead to further complications.
4. Neurological decline: The patient's encephalitis and subsequent neurological decline may continue to progress, leading to worsening cognitive function and potential complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to steroids and other medications increases the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
6. Cardiac events: The patient's history of ACS and NSTEMI puts him at risk for further cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic anemia, impaired airway clearance, altered mental status, hypernatremia, hypertension, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, and multiple other comorbidities. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on July 19th. He has had episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, and his hematocrit levels have been decreasing over the past two weeks. The patient's sodium levels have been elevated, and he has a history of renal failure. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, depression, and previous stent placement. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, analgesics, and medications for various other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of coffee ground emesis and perirectal bleeding suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to hypotension, anemia, and potentially require blood transfusions.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired airway clearance and a history of aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk for recurrent aspiration events leading to respiratory failure. The patient is currently on assist-control ventilation and is being suctioned frequently.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes chronic anemia, impaired airway clearance, altered mental status, hypernatremia, hypertension, and a history of ACS with NSTEMI. He is currently on various medications including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, hyoscyamine, fentanyl, metoprolol, hydralazine, IVIG, steroids, ASA, statin, beta-blocker, and nystatin. The patient's recent lab results show elevated sodium levels, elevated creatinine, and anemia. Imaging shows no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma, fecal impaction in the rectum, bibasilar consolidation consistent with aspiration, and a small right pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired airway clearance and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the patient develops another episode of aspiration or if there is an infection spread to the lower respiratory tract.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, which may be due to post-ATN diuresis of urea and insensible free water losses, or it could be secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. Free water flushes via PEG and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumptive encephalitis, chronic respiratory failure, and acute blood loss anemia. The patient has been experiencing apneic spells due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis and copious secretions, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's anemia is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by episodes of coffee grounds emesis and grossly occult blood stools. The patient has hypernatremia and constipation. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he has a history of myocardial infarction, for which he is currently on statins, beta-blockers, and aspirin. The patient is being held on Plavix due to upcoming procedures. The patient's EEG shows widespread encephalopathy but has been steadily improving after receiving IVIG and high-dose steroids. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and is being monitored for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifactorial chronic respiratory failure with ongoing apneic spells and copious secretions, likely secondary to brainstem involvement of encephalitis and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute blood loss anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by coffee grounds emesis and occult blood stools.

   Pt is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumptive encephalitis, acute respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation due to his brainstem involvement from the encephalitis. The patient also has a history of acute blood loss anemia, likely due to a GI bleed, as well as hypernatremia, constipation, hypertension, and a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased platelet count, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly elevated sodium levels.

The patient is being treated with various medications including proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. He has a PICC line in place and is receiving nutrition via a feeding tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further episodes of GI bleeding, worsening of respiratory failure, and potential cardiac complications due to the recent NSTEMI.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be critical, and close monitoring and management are required to address the multiple organ dysfunctions and prevent further complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumptive encephalitis, acute respiratory failure, and acute blood loss anemia due to gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple factors including apneic spells due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis, copious secretions likely causing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a history of coffee grounds emesis suggesting upper GI bleeding. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with apneic spells and copious secretions contributing to the issue. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure and the need for continued mechanical ventilation support.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The presence of copious secretions increases the risk of VAP. Early identification and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent or manage this complication.
3. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The patient's history of coffee grounds emesis and grossly occult blood-positive stools suggests an upper GI source for the bleed. Continued monitoring for signs of re-bleeding and close attention to hemodynamic stability are necessary.
4. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's Hct drop indicates acute blood loss. Monitoring for signs of hemodynamic instability and providing appropriate blood product transfusions as needed is essential.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's Hct dropped yesterday and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He is receiving IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has been lavaged for potential bleeding, but the lavage was negative. A CT abdomen was also performed, which was negative for any bleeding. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned for Monday.

The patient has allergies to eptifibatide and unknown medications. He has been receiving antibiotics, specifically cefipime and ciprofloxacin, since July 27th, 02:00 AM. He is on various ICU medications, including pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38°C (100.4°F) with a maximum temperature of 38°C (100.4°F)
- Heart rate: 79 bpm with a range of 66-92 bpm
- Blood pressure: 160/70 mmHg with a range of 94/67-181/91 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute with a range of 11-20 breaths per minute

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea and anxiety. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has multiple medical conditions including constipation, chronic anemia, impaired airway clearance, altered mental status, hypernatremia, fever, hypertension, and impaired motor function.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient has impaired airway clearance, which increases the risk of aspiration and respiratory infections. Additionally, the use of mechanical ventilation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has hypertension, and there is a mention of malignant hypertension crisis. This indicates a potential risk for cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke.

3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has constipation, which can lead to bowel obstruction and subsequent complications like bowel ischemia or perforation.

4. Neurological complications: The patient has impaired motor function and altered mental status. These conditions increase the risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and delirium.

5. Infection-related complications: The patient has fever and is at risk for various infections due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive lines. These infections can include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), or urinary tract infections (UTIs).

6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hypernatremia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline, currently attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has a tracheostomy and PEG tube in place. He is receiving antibiotics for a suspected bacterial infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has had episodes of fever, anemia, and hypernatremia. He also has autonomic instability and a history of ACS (acute coronary syndrome) with a previous NSTEMI. Other medical issues include depression and potential constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma from mechanical ventilation.

2. Neurologic Decline: The patient's acute neurologic decline requires close monitoring for any changes in mental status or neurological function. There is a risk of further deterioration or complications related to the underlying encephalitis.

3. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics for a suspected bacterial infection. However, there is still a risk of developing new infections or complications such as sepsis or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

4. Anemia: The patient has had episodes of coffee ground emesis and perirectal bleeding, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding as a possible cause of anemia. Further evaluation is needed to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurologic decline, initially attributed to encephalitis. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient's current condition is complicated by aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, anemia, constipation, hypernatremia, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, acute renal failure, ACS with NSTEMI, thrush, hyperglycemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event has led to pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if adequate ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes. It may lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and further complications.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation could potentially lead to bowel ischemia or perforation if not managed properly.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia, likely caused by post-ATN diuresis or diabetes insipidus, requires careful management to prevent neurological complications.
6. Autonomic Instability: The patient's autonomic instability can result in hypotension or hypertension, potentially leading to organ damage.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline, currently attributed to encephalitis. The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation (MV) due to respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia, but was uncomfortable and tachypnic, so he was switched back to assist-control (AC) ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation improved after suctioning a large mucous plug. Secretions are becoming too thick to suction, and hyosciamine has been discontinued for the third time. The patient's bowel regimen with enema, colace, senna, lactulose, and reglan was started but still no stool. The patient is still experiencing dyspnea and anxiety about frequent suctioning. 

Medical history includes anemia with unclear etiology, constipation, hypernatremia, autonomic instability, neurologic decline, acute renal failure, ACS (NSTEMI), thrush, hyperglycemia, depression, and ICU care. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 166/71 mmHg to 194/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, sodium of 129 mg/d"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed encephalitis, acute respiratory failure, and acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the need for tracheostomy. The patient has a history of hypertension and recent NSTEMI, for which antihypertensive and statin medications were started. The patient also has a history of coffee grounds emesis several weeks ago, suggesting possible upper GI bleed. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is scheduled to evaluate the source of bleeding. The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, with hypernatremia, and there may be a component of diabetes insipidus. The patient's encephalopathy has been improving after receiving IVIG and high-dose steroids. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient continues to have apneic spells due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis and has copious secretions, likely resulting in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on ciprofloxacin and cefipime until July 30th, but is not currently covered for Gram-positive cocci. There is a concern for VAP, and a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of presumptive encephalitis, acute respiratory failure, and a recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The note highlights several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have apneic spells due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis and did not tolerate pressure support/mandatory minute ventilation (MMV) yesterday. The patient also has copious secretions, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The healthcare team plans to try pressure support again since the patient's mental status has improved.

2. VAP: The patient had a previous bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on [**7-20**] with gram-negative diplococci but negative culture. Currently, the patient is on ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and cefipime until [**7-30**]. However, the patient is not currently covered for gram-positive cocci (GPC). A low-grade temperature may be indicative of an untreated gram-positive infection, but this is less likely without lower tract sampling.

3. GI Bleed with Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has episodes of coffee grounds emesis several weeks ago and grossly occult blood-positive stools. This suggests an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB), putting the patient at risk for an ulcer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of presumptive encephalitis, acute respiratory failure, GI bleed, and acute blood loss anemia. He has been experiencing apneic spells due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis and continues to have copious secretions, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on ciprofloxacin and cefipime for VAP treatment, but not covered for group of organisms causing VAP. He also has episodes of coffee grounds emesis several weeks ago, grossly occult blood positive stools, and likely upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), at risk for peptic ulcer. The patient has a history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 2 years prior, with access through PICC and peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines. Type and screen is ordered, awaiting esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) tomorrow. The patient is tolerating tube feedings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have apneic spells due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis and copious secretions, likely VAP. This could lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has not shown improvement despite being on ciprofloxacin and cefip"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. The patient has undergone several interventions including intubation, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). 

The patient's current medical conditions include aspiration pneumonia with respiratory failure, anemia of unclear etiology, hypernatremia, constipation, and acute renal failure. The patient also has a history of NSTEMI and ACS.

The patient's current treatments include antibiotics (cefepime and ciprofloxacin) for pneumonia, continuous venovenous hemodialiltration (CVVHD), and supportive care for various organ dysfunctions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, further decline in renal function, development of new infections due to prolonged intubation and immunosuppression, and bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and additional information may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   aspiration and pooling secretions with frequent desats resolved with
   suctioning. S/p trach/PEG on [**7-19**]. Concern for mucous plugging on [**7-19**]
   given thick secretions; [**7-20**] BAL and bronch washings with gram neg
   diplococci on gram stain, cx with OP Flora x2. [**Month (only) 51**] also have component
   from neurologic disease.  Yesterday placed on [**5-14**] with increased
   somnolence and respiratory acidosis on ABG but improved this AM.
   - Currently on cefepime and ciprofloxacin for ten day course (day 1
   [**2154-7-20**])
   - Currently on MMV, trial of PS
   - continue suction, chest PT
   - cont rehab screeen for d/c

   pneumonia.
   - panculture (blood, urine, endotracheal)
   - Cont cefepime and cipro as above; would add vanc for gram positive
   coverage if spikes fever > 101
   Anemia:  Unclear etiology for slow downtrend in Hct over 2 weeks. Did
   have two episodes of coffee ground emesis as well as one episode of
   perirectal bleeding thought [**2-11**] flexiseal irritation. B12, folate, iron

   - continue iron supplements and multivitamin
   - off heparin and plavix
   - f/u GI: plan for upper endoscopy on Monday
   Constipation: Now resolved
   - [**Doctor Last Name **] down bowel regimen (d/c reglan, lactulose)
   Hypernatremia:  Likely [**2-11**] post-ATN diuresis of urea and insensible
   free water losses. Less likely component of diabetes insipidus. Unclear
   why patient has had worsening of his hypernatremia over the past 24
   hours.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   - Continue free water flushes of 300cc Q4H via PEG

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He is currently intubated in the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been on a ventilator since [**2154-7-19**] and has had multiple episodes of fever, with the most recent one being a grade fever of unclear etiology. 

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal kidney function. His electrolytes are within normal range, except for hypernatremia. The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions including aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, depression, constipation, hyperglycemia, and ACS (NSTEMI). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 111/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and nosocomial infections. The patient is at risk for these complications due to his prolonged intubation and immobilization."

The patient is a 65-year-old male with brainstem encephalitis and a prolonged hospital stay. He has acute respiratory failure, likely multifactorial, and continues to have apneic spells due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis. The patient did not tolerate pressure support/minor mode ventilation yesterday. He is now being ventilated with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode. The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and acute blood loss anemia, with episodes of coffee grounds emesis several weeks ago. Grossly guaiac stools were noted, indicating likely upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is at risk for developing a gastric ulcer. 

The patient has hypernatremia and possibly diabetes insipidus. He received intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose steroids for brainstem encephalitis, which has been steadily improving. The patient also has hypertension and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), for which he is on statin therapy and beta-blockers. Plavix has been held due to recent bleeding events. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His weight is 108.5 kg, and he is receiving various medications including proton pump"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with brainstem encephalitis, prolonged hospital stay, acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and acute blood loss anemia. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient continues to have apneic spells due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis and did not tolerate pressure support/minimally invasive ventilation (MMV) yesterday. He is now experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. VAP: The patient has a history of VAP since July 20th, with gram-negative diplococci found in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), although the culture was negative. He is currently on ciprofloxacin and cefepime until July 30th, but not covered for gram-positive cocci (GPC). A low-grade temperature may be due to untreated GPC, but this is less likely due to negative lower tract sampling.
3. GI bleed with acute blood loss anemia: The patient had episodes of coffee grounds vomiting several weeks ago and grossly guaiac-positive stools. This suggests an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB), which increases the risk for a gastric ulcer. The patient is holding Plavix (PCI 2 years prior), has access with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, and plans for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EG"

   [**Last Name (un) 8426**] encephalitis, with prolonged hospital course. More recent
   events  have included VAP, in the context of which he developed
   worsening respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He has
   also had ongoing GI bleed , but with no obvious bleeding source by EGD

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with brainstem encephalitis and a prolonged hospital stay. He has been experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis. The patient also has a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and acute blood loss anemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient continues to have apneic spells due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis and did not tolerate pressure support/minorization modes of ventilation yesterday. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) and assisted spontaneous breathing (ASSIST). 

2. VAP treatment: The patient's VAP needs to be treated promptly. He is currently on ciprofloxacin and cephalosporin until July 30th. However, he is not currently covered for gram-positive cocci (GPC). 

3. GI bleed with acute blood loss anemia: The patient has been experiencing episodes of coffee grounds vomiting several weeks ago and grossly guaiac-positive stools. This suggests a likely upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB), at risk for a peptic ulcer. 

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is improving with free water flushes and dextrose 5% (D5) administration. This may be a component of diabetes insipidus (DI).

5. Brainstem encephalitis: The patient's brainstem encephalitis has been improving after receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and high-dose steroids. However, low-grade temperatures may indicate ongoing brainstem involvement.

6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol.

7. NSTEMI: The patient recently experienced a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), for which he has been prescribed statins, beta-blockers, and aspirin. Plavix has been held due to recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical issues. The patient underwent an endoscopy which revealed a medium hiatal hernia, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), retained fluids in the stomach, and erythema in the pylorus compatible with gastritis. The patient's sodium levels were initially high but have improved over the past 12 hours. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history.

The patient has several allergies, including eptifibatide, and has received various medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and lorazepam. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent endoscopy findings.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable heart rate, low blood pressure that responded to a normal saline bolus, and normal respiratory rate. The patient is on assisted ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, with settings including a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 99%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,054 mL, including 1,010 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 2,996 mL through intravenous fluids, and 175 mL through blood products. The patient's urine output"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurologic decline attributed to encephalitis. He has been intubated due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient underwent an endoscopy, which showed a medium hiatal hernia, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), retained fluids in the stomach, and erythema in the pylorus compatible with gastritis. His sodium levels have been fluctuating, and he has been treated for anemia, constipation, hypernatremia, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event and intubation increase the risk of pneumonia. The presence of gram-negative diplococci on gram stain from bronch washings suggests a bacterial infection.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anemia and guaiac positive stool indicate a potential gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's history of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and fluctuating creatinine levels suggest a risk of renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Neurological Decline: The patient's ongoing neurological decline requires further evaluation and management. The cause of the encephalitis remains unclear, and the MRI findings should be correlated with clinical symptoms.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels need to be managed, especially considering the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management. The patient underwent an endoscopy, which showed a medium hiatal hernia, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), retained fluids in the stomach, and erythema in the pylorus compatible with gastritis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP from 5 to 8 due to copious but clear secretions. The patient's sodium levels have been corrected, and fluid balance is being closely monitored.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/59 to 187/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is currently 108.5 kg, with a total fluid intake of 4,054 mL and output of 1,710 mL. The patient is receiving various medications through IV infusions, including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and lorazepam.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 264 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, blood glucose level of 110 mg/dL, sodium level of 145 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, and a normal creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and fluid overload. The patient's increased secretions and prolonged mechanical ventilation put him at risk for developing VAP. The presence of a medium hiatal hernia and gastritis increases the risk of stress ulcers. Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT. Additionally, the patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload.

It is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status, electrolyte levels, and fluid balance. Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis for stress ulcers and DVT prophylaxis should be considered. Frequent assessments of the patient's mental status and sedation level are necessary due to the use of sedative medications."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with acute neurologic decline now s/p aspiration event
   and intubation.
   .
   1. Aspiration: per family, has had difficulty with secretions and
   airway management for days. Thick/copious secretions aspirated from ETT
   on the floor.  Has been in the hospital since [**2154-6-20**]. Will need
   coverage for aspiration pneumonia
   -Cefepime/Vanc/Flagyl
   .
   # ECG changes: ECG changes concerning for STEMI, but improved with BP
   control.  Discussed ECG with cardiology. Patient has positive CE. Will
   treat for ACS and continue to trend enzymes.  Aspirin, statin, beta
   blocker for HR goal ~60.  Check CT head now, given change in neurologic
   examination prior to anticoagulation, then heparin gtt.
   .
   2. Neurologic decline: neurology following. Workup to-date has been
   negative. Patient refused LP. Has different neurologic examination than
   previous, mostly significant for loss of upgoing toes and now
   asymmetric reflexes--but in the setting of sedation/acute insult.  Per
   verbal report, unlikely myasthenia with negative aldolase. Had good VC
   earlier today at 1.8 L and NIF of 54. ? Paraneoplastic, he had CT chest
   at OSH performed, as most-likely tumor would be small cell lung cancer.
   -MRI per Neurology recommendation, focus on brainstem
   -Discuss LP with family, may be easier procedure with
   intubation/sedation
   .
   3. Leukocytosis:  probably related to recurrent aspiration vs. ? MI.
   Did not have foley catheter and has not been treated with steroids. Has
   cultures pending.  Will be covered with tx of HCAP for now.
   .
   4. Hypertension: BP much improved on sedation and patient with
   significant anxiety history.  Also, may reflect ongoing brainstem
   process.
   -MRI brain
   -Autoregulation as able
   # Hyponatremia: poor po intake over last several days, likely to be
   hypovolemic hyponatremia. Given possible paraneoplastic process, can
   consider this may be SIADH.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 65-year-old male with an acute neurological decline.
- He has been in the hospital since June 20th and experienced an aspiration event.
- The patient has a history of difficulty with secretions and airway management.
- He was intubated due to aspiration.
- The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, but there are concerns for STEMI (heart attack) based on ECG changes.
- The patient has positive CE (likely referring to cardiac enzymes) and will be treated for ACS (acute coronary syndrome).
- The patient will continue to trend enzymes and receive aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker for heart rate control.
- A CT head is recommended given the change in neurological examination prior to anticoagulation, followed by heparin.
- The patient has neurologic changes, including loss of upgoing toes and asymmetric reflexes, which may be related to an acute insult or sedation.
- There are negative findings on workup, including aldolase levels suggesting no myasthenia gravis.
- An MRI of the brain is recommended, focusing on the brainstem.
- The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to recurrent aspiration or possibly related to a myocardial infarction.
- Cultures are pending, and the patient will be treated with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia coverage.

","The patient is currently in the ICU and has undergone an endoscopy. The endoscopy revealed a medium hiatal hernia, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), retained fluids in the stomach, and erythema in the pylorus compatible with gastritis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable, and no further gastrointestinal workup is recommended at this time.

The patient's blood pressure (BP) has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 74/36 mmHg to 187/92 mmHg. The patient's heart rate (HR) has been relatively stable, ranging from 63 to 101 beats per minute. Respiratory rate (RR) has been within normal limits, ranging from 10 to 18 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) has been consistently above 99%.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, pantoprazole (Protonix), and lorazepam (Ativan). The patient has allergies to eptifibatide and an unknown allergy. Antibiotics were administered, specifically cefipime and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,054 mL and a total output of 1,710 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's weight has decreased from 110 kg at admission to 108.5 kg currently.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with acute neurological decline attributed to encephalitis, who has experienced an aspiration event and is currently intubated. The patient has a history of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on 07/19. There is concern for mucous plugging due to thick secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronch washings revealed gram-negative diplococci, consistent with pneumonia. The patient is being treated with cefepime and ciprofloxacin for a ten-day course.

The patient also has anemia, with a slow downtrend in hematocrit (Hct) over the past two weeks. The cause of the anemia is unclear, but the patient has had episodes of coffee ground emesis and perirectal bleeding. Blood tests show normal levels of vitamin B12, folate, and iron, and there are no signs of hemolysis. The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with appropriate hematocrit bumps, but the anemia persists, and the patient remains grossly guaiac positive.

Other medical issues include hypernatremia, which has normalized after decreasing free water flushes. The patient had a neurologic decline with widespread encephalopathy on EEG, but repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were negative. The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and interventions. Here is a summary of the information:

1. The patient underwent an endoscopy on [**2154-7-29**] at 03:45 PM. During the procedure, a medium hiatal hernia, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and retained fluids in the stomach were observed. Erythema in the pylorus compatible with gastritis was also noted, but the rest of the endoscopy results were normal.

2. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable, and no further gastrointestinal workup is recommended for now.

3. The patient experienced low blood pressure (SBPs) in the 80s post-procedure, which responded to a 1L normal saline (NS) bolus. The patient is still on assisted ventilation (AC) with increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 5 to 8.

4. The patient has copious but clear secretions and is unable to provide history due to sedation.

5. Allergies include eptifibatide and an unknown medication. The patient received antibiotics (cefipime and ciprofloxacin) on [**2154-7-30**] at 02:08 AM and 02:09 AM, respectively.

6. The patient is receiving various medications through infusions, including mid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute neurological decline, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, and multiple comorbidities. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has had several complications including anemia, hypernatremia, constipation, and renal failure. He has been treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, steroids, and blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been declining over time, indicating anemia. The cause of this anemia is unclear, but it may be due to chronic blood loss from gastrointestinal bleeding or another underlying condition. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has had episodes of high sodium levels (hypernatremia) in the past, which may be related to post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis or insensible fluid losses. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's fluid balance to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
3. Constipation: The patient had a recent episode of constipation, which has resolved. It is important to continue monitoring bowel movements and provide appropriate laxatives or stool softeners as needed.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) likely due to hypotension. Renal function should be closely monitored, and blood pressure management"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with brainstem encephalitis, prolonged hospital stay, acute respiratory failure, and presumed acute blood loss anemia. The patient has a history of NSTEMI and hypertension. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has been receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, lorazepam, lopressor, MVI, thiamine, folate, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and eptifibatide.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/65 mmHg to 187/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. The patient's weight is 108.5 kg, and height is 70 inches.

The patient has received IVIG and high-dose steroids for brainstem encephalitis, which has shown improvement. He also received treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease and slow gastrointestinal bleed. His hypernatremia may be related to diabetes insipidus, and he is receiving free water flushes and D5 for management.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 M with brainstem encephalitis and prolonged hosp stay, w/ acute
   respiratory failure, now w/ GI bleed and presumed acute blood loss
   anemia.
   1. Acute respiratory failure
  likely multifactorial.  Patient
   continues to have apneic spells due to brainstem involvement of the
   encephalitis amd didn
t tolerate pressure support/MMV yesterday. VAP,
   on ABX
   -VAP tx as below
   -change back to PSV and assess for apneic spells
   2. VAP - BAL on [**7-20**] w/ GN diplococci but neg culture. completing ABX
   course today
   3. Anemia- likely chronic disease + slow GI bleed (guaiac positive but
   neg EGD). brown stools.
   -dc'd Plavix (has been greater than 1 yr since PCI)
   -follow hct
   4. Hypernatremia -Continue free water flushes and D5.  F/u lytes
   today.  Possibly component of DI.
   5. Brainstem encephalitis
 EEG shows widespread encephalopathy.  s/p
   IVIG and high dose steroids.  Has been steadily improving.  ? if low
   grade temps [**2-11**] brainstem
   6.  HTN
 metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   7.  NSTEMI
 statin/bb/continued on ASA given recent event.  Dc'd

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I was physically present with the MICU housestaff  team on this date
   for discussion of the above history, exam and assessment and plan with
   which I agree.  I independently examined the patient and would add the
   following comments : 65 yo male with brainstem encephalitis, question
   [**Last Name (un) 8426**] encephalitis,course notable for acute respiratory failure
   requiring trach, VAP
s, hypernatremia, slow decrease in hct without
   obvious bleeding source by EGD yesterday. Issues include:
   1. Acute respiratory failure: has been maintained on AC ventilation and
   intermittently tolerating PSVMMV.
   2. VAP: to complete a course of abx with cipro and clinda today
   3. Hypernatremia: has responded to free water which will be continued.
   Na
s should continue to be followed.
   4. Brainstem encephalitis
   Appears appropriate for transfer to long care facility.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 65-year-old male with brainstem encephalitis and a prolonged hospital stay.
- The patient has experienced acute respiratory failure and required tracheostomy.
- There was a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) that was treated with antibiotics.
- The patient has slow gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, which is likely causing anemia.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which is being managed with free water flushes.
- The patient's brainstem encephalitis has shown improvement with treatment.
- The patient has hypertension and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient may continue to experience difficulty breathing due to brainstem involvement of the encephalitis.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Despite treatment with antibiotics, there is a risk of recurring or worsening VAP.

3. Anemia: The slow GI bleed and presumed acute blood loss anemia need to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels should be continuously followed and managed to prevent further complications.

5. Brainstem encephalitis: Although the patient has shown improvement, there is still a risk of neurological deterioration.

6. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure"
