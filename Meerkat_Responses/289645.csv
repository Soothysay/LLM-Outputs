   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 yo with hx of parkinson's presented to OSH with
   possible delirium and concern for NMS.
   .
   # Acute MS change: Likely NMS caused by abrupt stop of high doses of
   anti-parkinosonian drugs combined with high doses of Haldol at the OSH,
   though there is question of whether alcohol withdrawal is also
   contributing.  LP was bland, though many cultures are pending.  She is
   now alert on minimal sedation and able to follow basic commands.  She
   can likely be extubated today as she is on minimal vent settings and
   following commands.
   - Sinemet 25/100 two tabs Q6H and amantadine 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diazepam 5mg [**Hospital1 **] with midazolam boluses for agitation,
   assuming that alcohol withdrawal is playing a role.  We can reassess
   her benzodiazepine requirement and switch her over to only PO diazepam.
   - Continue thiamine
   - We can ease off of the aggressive hydration, but should still verify
   [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes today as she as at risk for hypokalemia,
   hypophosphatemia and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Fever: Likely due to NMS as the patient has no signs of infection and
   all cultures are negative to date.
   - On vancomycin, meropenem and acyclovir day 2 for empiric meningitis
   coverage.  These antibiotics can be stopped given given the patient
   improvement and normal LP.
   - avoid antipsychotics
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Acute renal failure: improved with aggressive hydration, suggesting
   cause was mild rhabdomyolysis and dehydration.  After being 6L positive
   yesterday we may need to begin gently diuresis today.
   .
   # elevated transaminbases: There has been some report from her husband
   that the transaminitis may be chronic.  Her numbers today or less
   suggestive of chronic alcoholism.
   - discuss with family about history of liver disease.
   - continue to trend LFTs.
   .
   # Anemia: no signs of bleed. elevated LDH suggestive of hemolysis but
   also could be due to rhabdo, concerning would be TTP/HUS.  Hemolysis
   labs negative, reticulocyte count low and iron studies suggestive of
   severe anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend hct with goal >21% or avoid end-organ symptoms.
   - was given 1 UPRC prior to transfer
   .
   # coagulopathy: was concerning for chronic liver dz, the the
   coagulopathy has now resolved.
   .
   # hypernatremia: appears to be hypovolemic hypernatremia. was
   significantly elevated in OSH and rapidly corrected
   - monitor daily and give 150mg free water flushes Q6hrs.
   - Continue to monitor qdaily.
   .
   # EtOH abuse: history until recent admission. given significant benzo
   administration, will hold further dose administration. withdrawal could
   possibly represent. will monitor and consider valium if indicated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 61-year-old woman with a history of Parkinson's disease, was admitted to the ICU with possible delirium and concern for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). She presented with rigidity and altered mental status. The patient underwent several interventions, including arterial line placement, lumbar puncture, central line placement, and administration of antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 38.1Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 126/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She was on minimal sedation and able to follow basic commands.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Her electrolytes were within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. Cultures were pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient was diagnosed with altered mental status, likely due to NMS caused by abrupt stop of high doses of anti-parkinsonian drugs combined with high doses of Haldol. Fever was also present but attributed to NMS since no signs of infection were observed and cultures were negative.

The plan included continuing minimal sedation, monitoring for alcohol withdrawal, and providing thiamine supplementation. Antibiotics were stopped given the patient's improvement and normal lumbar puncture results. Antipsychotics were avoided, and cultures"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease who presented to the hospital with possible delirium and concern for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). He was given high doses of anti-parkinsonian drugs and Haldol at the hospital, which may have contributed to the development of NMS. The patient also has a history of alcohol abuse and possible withdrawal. Laboratory tests show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and lactate dehydrogenase. The patient is experiencing fever, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. He has been started on Semit 25/100 twice daily, dantrolene for tremor and fever, IV fluids, and monitoring of CK, WBC, lytes, and BP/HR. Empiric coverage for meningitis has been initiated, and cultures are pending. The patient's renal function is impaired, with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. He also has elevated transaminases suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis. Anemia and coagulopathy are present, with elevated LDH and prolonged partial thromboplastin time. The patient's sodium level is elevated, indicating hypovolemic hypernatremia. Leukocytosis is also noted, which may be due to SIRS or infection. The patient is being monitored closely, with plans for further evaluation and management."

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of Parkinson's disease who presented to the hospital with possible delirium and concern for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). She was found to have rigidity, altered mental status, fever, and impaired skin integrity. Laboratory results showed elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and leukocytosis. The patient also had acute renal failure, elevated transaminases, anemia, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, and leucocytosis. She has a history of ethanol abuse and was given benzodiazepines. 

Potential medical complications:
1. NMS: NMS is a life-threatening condition caused by an adverse reaction to neuroleptic or antipsychotic drugs. Symptoms include altered mental status, fever, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction. Treatment involves discontinuing the offending agent, supportive care, hydration, and monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated pending culture results.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's initial elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest acute renal failure. Aggressive hydration has improved renal function, but ongoing monitoring and management are necessary.
4. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old individual with a history of Parkinson's disease who presented to the hospital with possible delirium and concern for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be due to NMS or an infection. However, there are no signs of infection, and sputum culture shows coag + Staph aureus colonization. All other cultures are negative to date.

2. Elevated transaminases: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may suggest chronic alcoholism. It is important to discuss this with the family and continue to monitor liver function tests (LFTs).

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, with a low reticulocyte count and iron studies suggestive of severe anemia of chronic disease. The hemolysis labs are negative, indicating that hemolysis is not the cause. Trending Hct with a goal of >21% or avoiding end-organ symptoms is advised.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient appears to have hypovolemic hypernatremia. Rapid correction of sodium levels is necessary to avoid complications. Monitor daily and give 150 mg free water flushes every 6 hours.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease who presented to the emergency department with possible delirium and concern for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). He was extubated and showed signs of possible alcohol withdrawal. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, fever, impaired skin integrity, and ineffective coping.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation support, indicating acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of respiratory function are necessary.
2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia, which appears to be hypovolemic hypernatremia. Daily monitoring of electrolyte levels and fluid balance is required to prevent further complications.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to NMS and alcohol withdrawal. Close observation and monitoring of mental status changes are essential.
4. Fever: The patient has an elevated temperature, which may be due to NMS or infection. Infection control measures should be implemented, and cultures should be monitored for any signs of infection.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be related to immobility or pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessment and prevention strategies, such as repositioning, should be implemented.
6. Ineffective Coping: The patient's ineffective coping mechanisms may contribute to the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old with a history of Parkinson's disease who presented to the hospital with possible delirium and concern for NMS (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome). The patient was extubated and showed signs of possible alcohol withdrawal. The patient's condition has been complex and has required close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required invasive ventilation and was on a ventilator. However, they were successfully extubated. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is essential to ensure that the patient does not experience respiratory failure again.

2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient had hypernatremia, which appeared to be hypovolemic in nature. Aggressive hydration helped improve acute renal failure, suggesting that dehydration may have contributed to the electrolyte imbalance. Daily monitoring of electrolyte levels and careful fluid management are necessary to prevent further electrolyte disorders.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient presented with possible delirium and concern for NMS. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset and fluctuating course of inattention and disorganized thinking. It is important to assess and manage the patient's mental status regularly to prevent further complications.

4. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient had an elevated temperature, and cultures were pending. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and determine appropriate treatment if an infection is confirmed.

 INEFFECTIVE COPING
   61 yo with hx of parkinson's presented to OSH with possible delirium
   and concern for NMS, now extubated with signs of possible alcohol
   withdrawal.
   # Acute MS change: Cause of her altered mental status was likely NMS,
   alcohol withdrawal and delirium.  It seems that she may have had some
   baseline dementia as well.  LP was bland, though viral cultures are
   pending.  Off of sedation except for PO valium on CIWA scale.  Able to
   follow commands.  Now swallowing as well.
   - Sinemet 25/100 two tabs Q6H and amantadine 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - weaned off of midazolam gtt, but still requiring doses of valium
   (40mg yesterday evening and 20mg since midnight).  Goal is to get back
   to home doses of oxazepam.  For now we will use a CIWA scale with PRN
   valium with scores>10.
   - Can d/c NG tube if she can swallow PO meds without difficulty (did
   drink juice without difficulty).  Then she can come out of restraints
   as well.
   - Continue thiamine
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Likely due to NMS as the patient has no signs of
   infection.  Except for an asymptomatic sputum culture with coag +
   staph, all other cultures are negative to date.  Of antibiotics,
   leukocytosis improving, afebrile.
   - avoid antipsychotics
   - f/u cultures
   # Elevated transaminases: There has been some report from her partner
   that the transaminitis may be chronic.  Her numbers are suggestive of
   chronic alcoholism.
   - RUQ ultrasound today.
   - discuss with family about history of liver disease.
   - continue to trend LFTs.
   # Anemia: Yesterday had a spurious hematocrit of 21%, repeat was 26
   which is near her baseline, but otherwise has had a stable anemia with
   MCV
s on the high side of normal.
   #.  hypernatremia: appears to be hypovolemic hypernatremia. was
   significantly elevated in OSH and rapidly corrected
   - monitor daily and give 150mg free water flushes Q6hrs.
   - Continue to monitor qdaily.
   # Acute renal failure: improved with aggressive hydration, suggesting
   cause was mild rhabdomyolysis and dehydration.  CK trending down, Cr
   normalized.
   # EtOH abuse: has a history of EtOH, unclear exact amount.  Has been
   getting significant amounts of benzodiazepenes for agitation which were
   being interpreted as possible withdrawal.
   - Q2hr CIWA scale with valium 5-10mg for CIWA>10.
   #. FEN: tube feeds off, and is now tolerating some clears.  If she can
   tolerate PO meds, we will d/c NG tube and start her on a clear fluid
   diet.
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin and pneumoboots
   -bowel regimen with colace and senna
   -PPI: not required

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease who presented to the hospital with possible delirium and concern for NMS (neuroleptic malignant syndrome). The patient is now extubated and showing signs of possible alcohol withdrawal. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, fever, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, and acute MS change. The cause of her altered mental status is likely NMS, alcohol withdrawal, and delirium. The patient's fever and leukocytosis are likely due to NMS, and her elevated transaminases suggest chronic alcoholism. She has anemia, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure, which have been addressed. The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and is currently being managed with CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal. She is tolerating some clears orally and is expected to start on a clear fluid diet soon. The patient will be transported to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates difficulty in breathing and may require continued monitoring and support.
2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has an imbalance in electrolytes and fluids, which can lead to various complications if not corrected.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status can impact her ability to make decisions or understand her surroundings, potentially increasing the risk of falls or other"

The respiratory support includes aerosol-cool face tent, standby ventilator mode, Vt ranging from 324-469 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 0, PEEP of 0 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 0 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 99%. 

Laboratory results include WBC count ranging from 13.1-19.2 K/uL, Hemoglobin ranging from 21.9-29.6 g/dL, Hct ranging from 26.3-29.0%, Platelet count ranging from 98-150 K/uL, Creatinine ranging from 0.5-0.8 mg/dL, Glucose ranging from 76-120 mg/dL, and other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Amylase/Lipase, Differential, D-dimer, Fibrinogen, Lactic Acid, Albumin, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4. 

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, electrolyte & fluid disorder, altered mental status, fever, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, and ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, but the use of mechanical ventilation suggests the possibility of respiratory failure.
2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: Imbalances in electrolytes and fluids can lead to various complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and kidney dysfunction.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to NMS, alcohol withdrawal, or other underlying conditions. It increases the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and delirium.
4. Fever: The patient's elevated temperature indicates the presence of fever, which can be a sign of infection or other systemic conditions.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infection.
6. Ineffective coping: The patient's ineffective coping mechanisms may contribute to psychological distress and hinder recovery."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with confusion and rigidity. She is currently sedated with diazepam and intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic alcohol use, which may have contributed to her impaired cognitive function. 

The patient's vital signs show a fever (38 C) and an elevated heart rate range (62 bpm). Her blood pressure is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is at 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,470 mL and a urine output of 2,930 mL. 

Her respiratory support includes standby ventilation with a tidal volume of 324 mL, a respiratory rate of 0, PEEP of 0 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 98%. Her ABG results indicate hypoxemia with an oxygen partial pressure of 33 mmHg.

During the physical examination, the patient appears comfortable and shows no signs of pain. Her eyes are pupils are equal and reactive, with no conjunctival edema. Her cardiovascular examination reveals a normal heart rhythm and no murmurs. Her extremities show trace edema in both lower extremities, but no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Her tone is normal.
