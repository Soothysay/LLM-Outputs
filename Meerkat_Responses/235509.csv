   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 3228**] is a 51 year old male with h/o
   hemachromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and alcohol abuse, and
   history of esophageal varices admitted for UGIB.
   1.       Upper GI Bleed. EGD today showed grade [**3-10**] esophageal varices
   s/p banding as well as esophagitis.  OSH EGD showed gastritis but did
   not comment on varices.  Was started on IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] and octreotide
   drip.  Had melena and bright red hematemasis overnight.  Currently has
   two peripheral (22, 18) and a PICC line for access.  Received 2 units
   of PRBCs this morning and 1.5 of emergency release blood at OSH.  Per
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had a few admissions for GIBs.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Hct of 35-40 per PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] 6 hour Hcts, transfuse to 30 given active bleeding
   - octreotide drip, IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - type and cross 2 units
   - cipro prophylaxis for SBP prophylaxis in patient with history of
   cirrhosis
   - sucralafate for two weeks
   - Liver team following
   - advance to clears
   - initiate nadolol 20 mg daily in PM if stable from standpoint of
   ongoing bleed
   2.       Tachycardia.  HR currently in the 130s and BP increasing,
   likely secondary to combination of alcohol withdrawal, GI bleed, and
   ?dehydration.  HR did not respond to fluid boluses, but mild
   improvement with ativan for CIWA scale and blood transfusion.  Also,
   normally on home BB and ACIE, which is being held.
   - monitor on tele
   - blood transfusions, to keep hct > 30
   - ativan per CIWA scale
   3.  Liver disease.  Patient has a history of hemochromatosis, alcohol
   abuse, and HCV.  Evidence of stigmata of chronic liver disease.
   - abdominal ultrasound
   - f/u iron studies
   - f/u HCV viral load
   4.  Alcohol abuse.  Physical exam and vitals suggestive of alcohol
   withdrawal.
   - ativan CIWA scale
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   5.  ELEVATED INR.  Likely secondary to combination of liver disease and
   poor PO intake.
   - attempt reversal with vitamin k 10mg PO x3 days
   6.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to marrow suppression from
   alcohol abuse or splenic sequestration.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1123**] Plt is in
   70s.  Unclear from PCP what prior workup has occurred.
   - obtain OSH records for previous workup and for prior [**Name10 (NameIs) 1123**] Plt
   count
   -  trend plts, transfuse for <50 while having GIB
   - check peripheral smear to r/o schistocytes
   7.  DIABETES MELLITUS
   -   RISS for now, hold glyburide for now
   8.  HYPERTENSION.  Likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal and not being
   on home antihypertensives.  Given history of varices, will consider
   resuming antihypertensives in PM if hemodynamically stable and no
   further ongoing bleeding.
   -  hold lopressor in setting of GIB, but consider starting nadolol in
   PM
   9.       Anion gap.  Patient has an elevated anion gap, with unclear
   etiology.
   - check u tox, s tox

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and alcohol abuse, admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has grade 3 esophageal varices, esophagitis, and gastritis. He received two units of packed red blood cells and is currently on IV pantoprazole and octreotide drip. The patient also has tachycardia, likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal, GI bleed, and possible dehydration. He is being closely monitored, and his Hct is being maintained above 30 with blood transfusions. Other medical issues include chronic liver disease, alcohol abuse, elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and an elevated anion gap with unclear etiology. The patient is currently in the ICU and will continue to receive close monitoring and care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has ongoing bleeding despite receiving treatment with IV pantoprazole and octreotide. There is a risk of further bleeding and the need for continued monitoring and intervention.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains in the 130s, indicating ongoing tachycardia. This could be due to alcohol withdrawal, GI bleed, and/or dehydration. Close monitoring and management of the patient's heart rate and blood pressure are essential.
3. Chronic liver disease: The patient's"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, and ethanol abuse/withdrawal, who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for erosive esophagitis with intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion and octreotide infusion. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 122 beats per minute, blood pressure of 172/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.6%, and platelet count of 51 K/uL. Other lab values include white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 51 fL, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's medical history is significant for hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, ethanol abuse/withdrawal, seizures, and esophageal varices. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding but no known bleeding ulcer seen at this time.

The patient is currently receiving various medications including ativan, protonix, ciprofloxacin, vitamin K, folate, thiamine, insulin sliding scale, and pantoprazole. He is also receiving intravenous fluids and blood product transfusions as needed.

The patient's physical examination reveals sinus tachycardia, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Neurologic examination is also not performed.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of esophageal varices and erosive esophagitis, and he is currently receiving PPI and octreotide infusions. Protonix is being changed to 40mg IV BID, and octreotide gtt is being discontinued for now. The patient will have q6h HCTs, and transfusion is recommended for <30 or falling HCT. Bolus 1L/1h now, and cipro 400mg IV x1 is given due to unclear h/o ascites/portal hypertension. The patient will be evaluated by the GI and hepatology services for further investigation, and a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may be performed for evaluation of varices.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to GI bleed, withdrawal, possible dehydration, and holding home beta blockers.
3. Hemochromatosis: Check current iron"

   - Liver team following
   - clears diet
   - increase nadolol to 40 mg daily given presence of varices
   2.       Tachycardia.  Tachycardia is improved.  Likely secondary to
   combination of GI bleed, right sided rib pain, and ?withdrawal (though
   clinically does not appear to be withdrawing at present.
   - monitor on tele
   - blood transfusions, to keep hct > 30
   - ativan per CIWA scale
   3.  Liver disease.  Patient has a history of hemochromatosis, alcohol
   abuse, and HCV.  Evidence of stigmata of chronic liver disease.
   Elevated Iron noted.  Abdominal ultrasound did not show cirrhosis.

   withdrawal though has significant alcohol history.
   - ativan CIWA scale
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   5.  ELEVATED INR.  Likely secondary to combination of liver disease and
   poor PO intake.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and alcohol abuse admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed grade II-III esophageal varices and gastritis/esophagitis. He was started on intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and octreotide drip. He has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission without an appropriate increase in hematocrit (Hct). He has multiple peripheral IV lines and a PICC line for access. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but he has a history of tachycardia, which is likely secondary to the combination of GI bleed, right-sided rib pain, and possible withdrawal. His liver disease is evident, with evidence of stigmata of chronic liver disease and elevated iron levels. Abdominal ultrasound did not show cirrhosis, but further evaluation is needed. The patient's alcohol abuse history is significant, and he is at risk for withdrawal. He has elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and anion gap metabolic acidosis, which are likely secondary to his liver disease and other factors. He is currently on various medications, including PPI, octreotide, sucralafate, nadolol, and insulin. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding from esophageal varices
2. Development of hepatic encephalopathy
3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)
4. Hepatic hydrothorax or pleural effusion
5. Hepatorenal syndrome
6. Hepatomegaly with or without ascites
7. Liver failure
8. Malnutrition or poor nutritional intake
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
10. Nosocomial pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
11. Delirium or altered mental status due to alcohol withdrawal or liver dysfunction
12. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to diabetes and medication effects
13. Hypotension or hypoperfusion due to blood loss and volume depletion
14. Renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion or hepatorenal syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 3228**] is a 51 year old male with h/o
   hemachromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and alcohol abuse, and
   history of esophageal varices admitted for UGIB.
   1.       Upper GI Bleed. EGD today showed grade [**3-10**] esophageal varices
   s/p banding as well as esophagitis.  OSH EGD showed gastritis but did
   not comment on varices.  Was started on IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] and octreotide
   drip.  Had melena and bright red hematemasis overnight.  Currently has
   two peripheral (22, 18) and a PICC line for access.  Received 2 units
   of PRBCs this morning and 1.5 of emergency release blood at OSH.  Per
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had a few admissions for GIBs.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Hct of 35-40 per PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] 6 hour Hcts, transfuse to 30 given active bleeding
   - octreotide drip, IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - type and cross 2 units
   - cipro prophylaxis for SBP prophylaxis in patient with history of
   cirrhosis
   - sucralafate for two weeks
   - Liver team following
   - advance to clears
   - initiate nadolol 20 mg daily in PM if stable from standpoint of
   ongoing bleed
   2.       Tachycardia.  HR currently in the 130s and BP increasing,
   likely secondary to combination of alcohol withdrawal, GI bleed, and
   ?dehydration.  HR did not respond to fluid boluses, but mild
   improvement with ativan for CIWA scale and blood transfusion.  Also,
   normally on home BB and ACIE, which is being held.
   - monitor on tele
   - blood transfusions, to keep hct > 30
   - ativan per CIWA scale
   3.  Liver disease.  Patient has a history of hemochromatosis, alcohol
   abuse, and HCV.  Evidence of stigmata of chronic liver disease.
   - abdominal ultrasound
   - f/u iron studies
   - f/u HCV viral load
   4.  Alcohol abuse.  Physical exam and vitals suggestive of alcohol
   withdrawal.
   - ativan CIWA scale
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   5.  ELEVATED INR.  Likely secondary to combination of liver disease and
   poor PO intake.
   - attempt reversal with vitamin k 10mg PO x3 days
   6.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to marrow suppression from
   alcohol abuse or splenic sequestration.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1123**] Plt is in
   70s.  Unclear from PCP what prior workup has occurred.
   - obtain OSH records for previous workup and for prior [**Name10 (NameIs) 1123**] Plt
   count
   -  trend plts, transfuse for <50 while having GIB
   - check peripheral smear to r/o schistocytes
   7.  DIABETES MELLITUS
   -   RISS for now, hold glyburide for now
   8.  HYPERTENSION.  Likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal and not being
   on home antihypertensives.  Given history of varices, will consider
   resuming antihypertensives in PM if hemodynamically stable and no
   further ongoing bleeding.
   -  hold lopressor in setting of GIB, but consider starting nadolol in
   PM
   9.       Anion gap.  Patient has an elevated anion gap, with unclear
   etiology.
   - check u tox, s tox

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and alcohol abuse, admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has grade III esophageal varices, gastritis, and evidence of chronic liver disease. He has received treatment including banding, octreotide drip, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient experienced melena and bright red hematemesis overnight, received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and has a PICC line for access.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient has ongoing bleeding despite treatment with banding, octreotide drip, and PPI. Continuous monitoring and further interventions may be required to control the bleeding.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 130s, which could be due to alcohol withdrawal, GI bleed, and possible dehydration. Close monitoring and management of symptoms are necessary.
3. Liver Disease: The patient has a history of hemochromatosis, alcohol abuse, and HCV, with evidence of chronic liver disease. Further evaluation with an abdominal ultrasound, f/u iron studies, and HCV viral load is recommended.
4. Alcohol Abuse: The patient's physical exam and vital signs suggest alcohol withdrawal. Management with ativan CIWA scale, thiamine, folate, and MVI is advised.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall and 94.8 kg obese male admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed grade II-III gastritis/esophagitis, and four bands were placed. The patient has been receiving Carafate and nadolol. The patient's platelet count increased from 47 to 71 after receiving one bag of platelets. A total of four units of blood transfusion were given since admission. The patient has a PICC line in place, and an abdominal ultrasound showed fatty infiltration of the liver with final results pending. The patient has multiple allergies, including ciprofloxacin, and is currently on various medications such as octreotide, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, lorazepam (Ativan), and pantoprazole (Protonix).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Given the patient's presentation with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, there is a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the underlying cause of the initial bleed is not adequately managed.
2. Infection: Due to the invasive procedures like EGD and PICC line placement, there is a risk of infection, particularly if proper sterile techniques are not followed.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The presence of fatty infiltration of the liver raises concerns about the potential development of hepatic encephalopathy,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the setting of heavy alcohol use, hemochromatosis, and Hepatitis C. He presented with hematemesis and underwent endoscopy, revealing grade 3-10 esophageal varices with small bleeding. The varices were banded, and the patient received octreotide and IV pantoprazole.

The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, hemochromatosis, and Hepatitis C, which are possible causes of cirrhosis. His baseline hematocrit (Hct) is in the mid-30s. Now, he is experiencing a variceal bleed with banding.

Assessment and Plan:
- Continue octreotide and IV pantoprazole.
- Follow Hct every 8 hours.
- Continue beta-blocker (uptitrate).
- Ciprofloxacin prophylaxis.
- Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler imaging to evaluate patency of portal system: await final read.
- Goal HCT > 30 in the setting of bleeding, Goal Plt > 50, and INR < 1.5.
- Oral vitamin K.
If Hct declines or becomes unstable hemodynamically, may need relook endoscopy (EGD/colonoscopy).

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophageal varices, in the setting of heavy alcohol use, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C. The patient presented with a grade 3-10 esophageal varices bleed, which was successfully banded. The patient received octreotide and IV pantoprazole prophylaxis, and his Hct was monitored every 8 hours. Beta-blocker therapy was continued to manage hypertension and tachycardia. The patient also received ciprofloxacin prophylaxis and an abdominal ultrasound with Doppler imaging was ordered to evaluate the patency of the portal system.

The patient's bloodwork revealed a low platelet count (51) and an elevated INR of 1.4. The patient's vitals showed stable temperature, blood pressure within normal range, and slightly elevated heart rate. The patient's respiratory rate was within normal limits, and his oxygen saturation was 93%. The patient's general appearance was well-nourished with no acute distress. Physical examination findings included distended abdomen and peripheral edema.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the setting of heavy ethanol (EtOH) abuse, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C as risk factors for cirrhosis and possible varices. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving octreotide and intravenous pantoprazole for the bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 145/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is hemodynamically stable, but there is mention of tachycardia and hypertension, which could be related to the EtOH abuse or the ongoing bleeding.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose level of 145 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated ALT/AST levels and elevated total bilirubin level. The platelet count is low at 51, and the international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated at 1.4, indicating impaired liver function and coagulopathy.

The patient's abdomen is described as soft, non-tender, and distended. There are no significant findings on the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old overweight male who presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently withdrawing from alcohol, requiring the use of benzodiazepines and haloperidol. The patient has splenomegaly on abdominal ultrasound and an elevated HCV viral load. His platelet count is stable at 70,000/uL, and he has received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with an initial hematocrit (Hct) of 29.7%. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 112-169 mmHg, heart rate between 72-80 bpm, respiratory rate of 11-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 2,803 mL and output of 3,015 mL over the past 24 hours. 

Lab results show a normal white blood cell count, slightly elevated hemoglobin, and stable platelet count. Liver enzymes (ALT/AST), bilirubin, amylase, and lipase are within normal limits. However, the patient's creatinine is elevated at 1.0, and there are abnormalities in electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, phosphorus). Other lab values such as albumin, LDH, calcium, and liver function tests are also provided.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and alcohol abuse.
- He was admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and has evidence of alcohol withdrawal.
- The patient's current medications include nadolol, ativan, haldol, thiamine, folate, and MVI.
- His vital signs are stable, but he has hypertension that is being managed with antihypertensives.
- The patient has an elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus.
- He also has splenomegaly on abdominal ultrasound and a history of esophageal varices.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and further evaluations are needed to determine the underlying causes of his liver disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk for severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms due to his recent cessation of alcohol intake. Monitoring and administration of benzodiazepines will be necessary to manage this condition.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient has received treatment for the bleeding, there is a risk of re-bleeding or further complications related to the esophageal varices. Close monitoring and ongoing management are required.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be controlled to prevent further complications, such as heart attack or stroke. Medications and lifestyle modifications will be necessary.

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and alcohol abuse. He was admitted for an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which showed grade 3 esophageal varices that were banded. He has received intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and octreotide drip. He has received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) without an appropriate increase in hematocrit (Hct). His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 169/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the setting of heavy ethanol (EtOH) abuse, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C. The patient presented with esophageal varices grade 3-10, which were successfully banded on [**12-9**]. The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct) is in the mid-30s. 

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for variceal bleed stabilization and treatment. The plan includes octreotide until [**12-12**] and intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's Hct will be followed every 12 hours, and beta blockers will be continued with titration as needed. The goal Hct is above 30, platelet count above 50, and international normalized ratio (INR) below 1.5. Oral vitamin K will also be administered.

The assessment and plan address the patient's cirrhosis, hypertension/tachycardia, EtOH abuse, thrombocytopenia, and ICU care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Rebleeding from the esophageal varices.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function.
3. Infection due to immunosuppression from cirrhosis and/or antibiotic use.
4. Kidney injury due to hypoperfusion"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the setting of heavy alcohol use, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C. He has experienced a recent variceal bleed, which has been treated with banding. The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct) is in the mid-30s, and he is currently stable post variceal bleed.

The patient's current medical issues include cirrhosis, hypertension/tachycardia, alcohol abuse, thrombocytopenia, and potential complications related to his critical condition.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 165/102 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. His temperature is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.6-8.8 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.6-34.5%, platelet count of 51-70 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 241 mg/dL.

The patient has an enlarged spleen, measuring 15.4 cm, but no ascites. He has undergone banding for esophageal varices and is currently on octreotide and IV pantoprazole. The patient's goals include maintaining a hematocrit greater than 30%, platelet count greater than 50 thousand/mm3, and an INR less than 1.5.

The patient's potential medical complications include further bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and sepsis. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the setting of heavy ethanol (EtOH) abuse, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C. The patient had esophageal varices that were banded on [**12-9**]. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is believed to be caused by possible causes such as EtOH abuse, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C, leading to cirrhosis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 165/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm heart rhythm. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 94.8 kg. The patient has received octreotide and intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for the variceal bleed, with stable hematocrit levels. The plan is to follow the patient's hematocrit every 12 hours, continue beta-blocker therapy, and aim for a hematocrit level greater than 30, platelet count greater than 50, and international normalized ratio (INR) less than 1.5. Additionally, the patient is being evaluated for ongoing cirrhosis, including hemochromatosis and hepatitis C, as well as EtOH abuse. The"

","The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been receiving various medications including IV lorazepam (Ativan) for agitation, IV labetalol for high blood pressure, and diazepam (Valium) as needed for CIWA. The patient also has a PICC line in place.

Upon reviewing the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is stable, blood pressure is elevated but being managed with medication, respiratory rate is slightly high, and oxygen saturation is good.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,699 mL and output of 5,135 mL, indicating a positive fluid balance. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, normal cardiovascular examination, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and trace peripheral edema. Neurologic assessment is not documented.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated ALT and AST levels. The imaging studies show splenomegaly, no ascites, and echogenic liver consistent with fatty liver disease.

The patient's medical history includes alcohol abuse, and the family history is not documented. The patient is on a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 3228**] is a 51 year old male with h/o liver
   disease secondary to hemachromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and
   history of esophageal varices admitted for UGIB now in alcohol
   withdrawal.
    1.  Alcohol withdrawal.  Requiring large amounts of benzos to control
   symptoms and haldol (with limited use due to qt prolongation).  Better
   effect with valium than ativan so will transition to valium.
   - switch to valium per CIWA scale
   - haldol as needed while monitoring QTc
           -  thiamine, folate, mvi
           -  daily EKG for QTc evaluation
   2.        Upper GI Bleed. EGD showed grade [**3-10**] esophageal varices s/p
   banding as well as esophagitis.  Was started on IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**].  Was on
   octreotide drip for 3 days, now completed.  No BMs or hematemasis in
   last 24 hours.  S/p 5 units of PRBC during hospitalization.  Hct now
   stable.   Baseline Hct of 35-40 per PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Hospital1 7**] Hcts
   -  IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - type and cross 2 units
   - sucralafate for two weeks
   - Liver team following
   - regular diet
   -  nadolol 40 mg daily given presence of varices
   3. Hypertension.  Patient on lisinopril and lopressor at home at
   unknown doses.  Nadolol initiated during hospital stay due to history
   of varices.  Patinet has ongoing hypertension likely due to withdrawal
   from alcohol plus baseline hypertension.
   - tolerate SBP < 160, prn IV antihypertensives
   - continue nadolol
   - initiate lisinopril
   .
   4.   Liver disease.  Patient has a history of hemochromatosis, alcohol
   abuse, and HCV.  Evidence of stigmata of chronic liver disease.
   Elevated Iron noted.  Abdominal ultrasound did not show cirrhosis, but
   showed splenomegaly and no ascites.  Patient state prior workup for
   liver disease including liver biopsy occurred at [**Hospital1 19**] many years ago,
   but no record of this.  Outpatient GI doctor is unclear of prior workup
   given that patient does not follow up regularly.  History of Hep B
   vaccination.  History of hep A infection in past.  [**Doctor First Name **] negative
   - f/u final read of abdominal ultrasound
   - f/u anti smooth muscle antibiody HFE, to evaluate for other etiology
   of cirrhosis
   5.   THROMBOCYTOPENIA.  Likely secondary to splenic sequestration.  At
   baseline platelet count.

- The patient has been treated with benzodiazepines and haloperidol for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, with better effect observed with valium.
- An upper endoscopy revealed grade [**3-10**] esophageal varices, which were banded. The patient was also found to have esophagitis and was started on intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
- The patient received octreotide drip for three days and has completed the treatment. No bleeding or black tarry stools have been observed in the last 24 hours. He received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) during hospitalization, and his hematocrit (Hct) is now stable.
- The patient's baseline Hct is between 35-40%, as per primary care physician (PCP).
- The patient is currently on nadolol 40 mg daily due to the presence of varices, and his blood pressure (SBP) remains elevated.
- The patient has a history of hemochromatosis, alcohol abuse, and HCV, with evidence of chronic liver disease.

   In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 3228**] is a 51 year old male with h/o
   hemachromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and alcohol abuse, and
   history of esophageal varices admitted for UGIB now in alcohol
   withdrawal.
    1.  Alcohol withdrawal.  Patient now 48 hours from last drink with
   evidence of alcohol withdrawal.  Requiring large amounts of benzos to
   control symptoms and haldol.
   - ativan per CIWA scale
   - haldol as needed while monitoring QTc
           -  thiamine, folate, mvi
           - daily EKG for QTc evaluation
   2.        Upper GI Bleed. EGD showed grade [**3-10**] esophageal varices s/p
   banding as well as esophagitis.  Was started on IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] and
   octreotide drip.  No BMs or hematemasis in last 24 hours.  Currently
   has two peripheral (22, 18) and a PICC line for access.  Received 5
   units of PRBCs since admission without appropriate increase in hct (25
 34.5).   [**Hospital1 **] Hct of 35-40 per PCP.

   - d/c cipro given that patient has no evidence of ascites
   - sucralafate for two weeks
   - Liver team following
   - regular diet
   -  nadolol 40 mg daily given presence of varices
   3. Hypertension.  Patient on lisinopril and lopressor at home at
   unknown doses.  Nadolol initiated during hospital stay due to history
   of varices.  Patinet has ongoing hypertension likely due to withdrawal
   from alcohol plus [**Hospital1 1123**] hypertension.
   - tolerate SBP < 160, prn IV antihypertensives
   - continue nadolol (though patient unlikely to tolerate Pos given
   sedation)
   .
   4.   Liver disease.  Patient has a history of hemochromatosis, alcohol
   abuse, and HCV.  Evidence of stigmata of chronic liver disease.
   Elevated Iron noted.  Abdominal ultrasound did not show cirrhosis, but
   showed splenomegaly and no ascites.  Patient state prior workup for
   liver disease including liver biopsy occurred at [**Hospital1 19**] many years ago,
   but no record of this.  Outpatient GI doctor is unclear of prior workup
   given that patient does not follow up regularly.
   - f/u final read of abdominal ultrasound

   poor PO intake.  Minimal effect with oral vitamin K.
   - follow INR
   6.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to marrow suppression from
   alcohol abuse or splenic sequestration.  Noted to have splenomegaly on
   abdominal ultrasound.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1123**] Plt is in 70s.  Unclear from

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and alcohol abuse. He is admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is now experiencing alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been treated with IV PPI, octreotide drip, and banding of esophageal varices. He has received 5 units of packed red blood cells but has not shown an appropriate increase in hemoglobin concentration. The patient also has hypertension, liver disease, elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus. He is currently in the ICU for care and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal after 48 hours without alcohol intake. He requires large amounts of benzodiazepines to control symptoms and monitoring of QTc interval.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had a grade 3-10 esophageal varices bleed that was treated with banding and IV PPI. He received blood transfusions but did not show an adequate increase in hemoglobin levels. Continuous monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of rebleeding.
3. Hypertension: The patient has ongoing hypertension, which may be due to alcohol withdrawal and underlying medical conditions. Blood pressure should be closely monitored, and appropriate antihypertensive medications may be required.
4. Liver disease: The patient has a history of hemochromatosis, alcohol abuse"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), heavy ethanol (EtOH) abuse, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to UGIB associated with grade 3 esophageal varices that were banded on 12/9.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:
1. GIB: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, hemochromatosis, and possible Hep C as potential causes of cirrhosis. He underwent banding and octreotide therapy for variceal bleeding, with stable hematocrit levels. The plan includes IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI), follow-up hemoglobin checks every 12 hours, continued beta-blocker therapy (uptitrate), goal hematocrit >30 in the setting of bleeding, platelet count >50, and international normalized ratio (INR) <1.5. Oral vitamin K is also administered.
2. Cirrhosis: Ongoing evaluation for cirrhosis is planned, considering hemochromatosis, Hep C, EtOH abuse, and other potential etiologies.
3. HTN/tachycardia: This is likely related to underlying hypertension and exacerbated by withdrawal. Lisinopril will be added back at home dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the setting of heavy alcohol (EtOH) abuse, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C. He has esophageal varices that were banded on 12-9. He is currently in the ICU due to UGIB and is being treated with intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI), follow-up hemoglobin (Hct) checks every 12 hours, continuation of beta-blocker therapy, and goal Hct >30 in the setting of bleeding. The patient also has thrombocytopenia with an unclear etiology, possibly related to EtOH abuse or hemochromatosis with marrow infiltrate. He has significant splenomegaly on ultrasound, which likely explains the thrombocytopenia. The goal is to maintain platelet count >50.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB and is currently experiencing bleeding. This condition can lead to hypovolemia, shock, and organ failure if not managed promptly.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis may be due to hemochromatosis, hepatitis C, and/or EtOH abuse. Cirrhosis can progress to liver failure and increase the risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), heavy alcohol use, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C. He has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is showing signs of EtOH withdrawal and an increasing QTc on ECG. His labs show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient is currently receiving IV pantoprazole, beta blockers, and oral vitamin K. He is also being monitored for cirrhosis, hypertension/tachycardia, EtOH abuse, thrombocytopenia, and nutritional support.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB, which can be life-threatening if there is re-bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to cirrhosis and hepatitis C, increasing the risk of infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of cirrhosis, characterized by confusion and altered mental status.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: Advanced liver disease can lead to kidney dysfunction, which may require dialysis.
5. Variceal bleeding: The patient has already experienced bleeding from esophageal varices, which can recur and require intervention.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the setting of heavy ethanol (EtOH) abuse, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C. He has UGIB in the setting of grade 3 esophageal varices that were previously banded on [**12-9**]. The patient's GIB is likely due to a combination of factors including EtOH abuse, hemochromatosis, and possibly hepatitis C, leading to cirrhosis. His most recent hematocrit (Hct) was in the mid-30s, indicating significant blood loss. He underwent variceal bleeding with banding and an octreotide course, resulting in stable Hct.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing evaluation for cirrhosis, including hemochromatosis and hepatitis C as well as EtOH abuse, and other potential etiologies of cirrhosis. For hypertension and tachycardia, a beta-blocker is prescribed. The patient is also progressing into withdrawal, so CIWA scale using haldol for hallucinations, benzo for agitation, and metop/labetalol IVP for HTN/tachy are administered. Fluid repletion with D5, thiamine, and folate is given, along with an advance diet as tolerated and an ECG check. Lactulose is considered, but placement of an NG tube blindly is avoided due to var"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 3228**] is a 51 year old male with h/o liver
   disease secondary to hemachromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and
   history of esophageal varices admitted for UGIB now in alcohol
   withdrawal.
    1.  Alcohol withdrawal.  Requiring large amounts of benzos to control
   symptoms and haldol (with limited use due to qt prolongation).  Better
   effect with valium than ativan so will transition to valium.
   - switch to valium per CIWA scale
   - haldol as needed while monitoring QTc
           -  thiamine, folate, mvi
           -  daily EKG for QTc evaluation
   2.        Upper GI Bleed. EGD showed grade [**3-10**] esophageal varices s/p
   banding as well as esophagitis.  Was started on IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**].  Was on
   octreotide drip for 3 days, now completed.  No BMs or hematemasis in
   last 24 hours.  S/p 5 units of PRBC during hospitalization.  Hct now
   stable.   Baseline Hct of 35-40 per PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Hospital1 7**] Hcts
   -  IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - type and cross 2 units
   - sucralafate for two weeks
   - Liver team following
   - regular diet
   -  nadolol 40 mg daily given presence of varices
   3. Hypertension.  Patient on lisinopril and lopressor at home at
   unknown doses.  Nadolol initiated during hospital stay due to history
   of varices.  Patinet has ongoing hypertension likely due to withdrawal
   from alcohol plus baseline hypertension.
   - tolerate SBP < 160, prn IV antihypertensives
   - continue nadolol
   - initiate lisinopril
   .
   4.   Liver disease.  Patient has a history of hemochromatosis, alcohol
   abuse, and HCV.  Evidence of stigmata of chronic liver disease.
   Elevated Iron noted.  Abdominal ultrasound did not show cirrhosis, but
   showed splenomegaly and no ascites.  Patient state prior workup for
   liver disease including liver biopsy occurred at [**Hospital1 19**] many years ago,
   but no record of this.  Outpatient GI doctor is unclear of prior workup
   given that patient does not follow up regularly.  History of Hep B
   vaccination.  History of hep A infection in past.  [**Doctor First Name **] negative
   - f/u final read of abdominal ultrasound
   - f/u anti smooth muscle antibiody HFE, to evaluate for other etiology
   of cirrhosis
   5.   THROMBOCYTOPENIA.  Likely secondary to splenic sequestration.  At
   baseline platelet count.
   -  trend plts, transfuse for <50 while having GIB
   7.  DIABETES MELLITUS
   -   RISS for now, hold glyburide for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of liver disease secondary to hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and history of esophageal varices. He was admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is now experiencing alcohol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 155/81 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His lab results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 35/73) and abnormal coagulation profile (PTT: 27.2, INR: 1.3). The patient has received treatment for UGIB, including banding of esophageal varices and administration of IV PPI. He has also been started on lisinopril and nadolol for hypertension. The patient's platelet count is low, likely due to splenic sequestration. Further evaluation is needed for other etiologies of cirrhosis, including HFE gene mutation and anti-smooth muscle antibody. The patient's diabetes mellitus is currently managed with a RISS insulin regimen. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 3228**] is a 51 year old male with h/o liver
   disease secondary to hemachromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, HCV, and
   history of esophageal varices admitted for UGIB now in alcohol
   withdrawal.
    1.  Alcohol withdrawal.  Benzo requirements are improving.  Haldol use
   limited due to qt prolongation.
   - valium per ciwa scale
   - haldol as needed while monitoring QTc
           -  thiamine, folate, mvi
           -  daily EKG for QTc evaluation
           - switch meds to PO now that taking adequate POs
   2.        Upper GI Bleed. EGD showed grade [**3-10**] esophageal varices s/p
   banding as well as esophagitis.  Continues on PPI [**Hospital1 7**] (orally).  Was on
   octreotide drip for 3 days, now completed.  S/p 5 units of PRBC during
   hospitalization.  Hct now stable.   Baseline Hct of 35-40 per PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Hospital1 7**] Hcts
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - type and cross 2 units
   - sucralafate for two weeks
   - Liver team following
   - regular diet
   -  nadolol 40 mg daily given presence of varices
   3. Hypertension.  Patient on lisinopril and lopressor at home at
   unknown doses.  Nadolol initiated during hospital stay due to history
   of varices.  Patinet has ongoing hypertension likely due to withdrawal
   from alcohol plus baseline hypertension.
   - tolerate SBP < 160, prn IV antihypertensives
   - continue nadolol
   - increase lisinopril to 40 mg daily
   .
   4.   Liver disease.  Patient has a history of hemochromatosis, alcohol
   abuse, and HCV.  Evidence of stigmata of chronic liver disease.
   Elevated Iron noted.  Abdominal ultrasound did not show cirrhosis, but
   showed splenomegaly and no ascites.  Patient state prior workup for
   liver disease including liver biopsy occurred at [**Hospital1 19**] many years ago,
   but no record of this.  Outpatient GI doctor is unclear of prior workup
   given that patient does not follow up regularly.  History of Hep B
   vaccination.  History of hep A infection in past.  [**Doctor First Name **] negative, but
   anti smooth muscle antibody positive.
   - f/u HFE
   5.   THROMBOCYTOPENIA.  Likely secondary to splenic sequestration.  At
   baseline platelet count.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to heavy alcohol consumption, hemochromatosis, and hepatitis C. He has undergone banding for esophageal varices and received octreotide for the bleed. His current condition is stable with a hematocrit level above 30.

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis, hypertension, tachycardia, ethanol abuse, and thrombocytopenia. His current treatment plan includes continuing beta-blockers for varices, maintaining a hematocrit level above 30, platelet count above 50, and an international normalized ratio (INR) below 1.5. He will also receive oral vitamin K, and ongoing evaluation for cirrhosis will be conducted.

The patient's other issues include ethanol abuse, hypertension/tachycardia, and thrombocytopenia. For ethanol abuse, the patient will continue with PO valium and CIWA scale management. Thiamine and folate supplementation will be provided, and a QTc check will be done.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition will be managed with a regular diet, and glycemic control will be maintained using regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has a PICC line inserted on [date] and will receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
