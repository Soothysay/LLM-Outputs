   Assessment and Plan
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   # Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: Pt noted to have cholangitis and
   pancreatitis on ERCP examination, two stones were extracted from the
   ampulla and common hepatic duct, a sphincterotomy was performed. Pt
   received approx 4.5L  NS IVF hydration for his pancreatitis. LFTs and
   Lipase this AM show a downward trend.
   - Will continue Zosyn for enteric coverage and Vancomycin for Gram
   positive coverage
   - Will continue IVF 150cc/hr LR maintenance
   - Will trial on clears and ADAT
   - Morphine 2-4mg  q4hr IV PRN pain
   - Pt still hypovolemic, Pancreatitis fluid needs similar to burn pt
   needs, will continue 500cc LR bolus x 2. Pt
s PO intake should also
   increase with clear diet in place.
   .
   #. Hypotension: After induction yesterday pt was noted to be
   hypotensive to the SBP 70s, on arrival to the floor pt was on pressor
   support however after transfer to his bed his MAPs were noted to be >65
   without pressor support. Since this event pt
s SBP have ranged from mid
   80s to 110s and appear to be fluid responsive. Current hypotension most
   likely hypovolemic given the fluid loss involved with pancreatitis.
   Will continue to IVF bolus with LR for a goal MAP >65.
   - IVF fluid for MAPs >65
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Pt has histroy of CKD with a baseline Creatinine of
   1.7-1.9. Pt's Creatinine currently elevated at 2.4 increased from 2.2.,
   most likely pre-renal versus ATN given his pancreatitis. In spite of
   the increase in pressure pt
s UOP has still remained borderline which
   may indicate a marker of pre-renal failure.
   - Will renally dose all medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Obtain urine lytes
   - Will currently hold on AEI and [**Last Name (un) **] therapy
   .
   # DM II: Per [**Name (NI) **] pt usually takes Glyburide 5mg once a day, will
   transition pt to insulin sliding scale particularly given his NPO
   status and likely increased insulin needs given his infectious state.
   - Check CBGs qACHS
   - Will continue ISS as pt is only on clears diet, will switch to Lantus
   coverage when pt tolerates solid PO.
   - Will transition back to Glyburide prior to discharge
   - Will currently hold ACEI and [**Last Name (un) **] therapy given pt's current [**Last Name (un) **].
   .
   # systolic CHF: Pt on prior echo noted to have a reduced EF of 40% with
   a fixed Apical defect. Pt on afterload therapy with Lisinopril and
   Valsartan per [**Last Name (un) 2040**].
   - Will currently hold ACEI and [**Last Name (un) **] as pt has [**Last Name (un) **]
   - Will use caution with IVF hydration given depressed systolic function
   .
   #  Sinus Tachycardia: Pt has been sinus tachycardic overnight, sinus
   tachycardia most likely a component of his still present hypovolemia
   and pain.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a well-nourished elderly Caucasian male who is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure yesterday, which revealed two irregular stones in the common bile duct (one impacted in the ampulla) and common hepatic duct. Mild dilation of the biliary tree and drainage of infected black bile were also observed.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.7°C (98.1°F), HR: 119 bpm (with a normal range of 73-119 bpm), BP: 109/67 mmHg (with a normal range of 82-136/40-88 mmHg), RR: 26 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 11-32 breaths per minute), and SpO2: 98%.

The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), troponin-T, TCO2, amylase, lipase, ALT, AST, Alk Phos, T Bili, CK, CKMB, and Troponin-T. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a well-nourished elderly Caucasian male who was admitted with acute pancreatitis and cholangitis. He underwent an ERCP procedure which showed two irregular stones in the common bile duct and common hepatic duct, with mild dilation of the biliary tree and drainage of infected black bile. The patient received approximately 4.5L of normal saline IVF hydration for his pancreatitis, and his lipase levels are showing a downward trend.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine of 1.7-1.9. His current creatinine level is elevated at 2.4, which may indicate pre-renal failure or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Given the large amount of fluids received since the ERCP, the patient's renal output has not shown vast improvement. Therefore, it is important to obtain urine electrolytes to assess for ATN and trend creatinine levels.

The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and is currently NPO (nothing by mouth). Insulin sliding scale will be started due to his NPO status and likely increased insulin needs given his infectious state. Glyburide will be transitioned back prior to discharge.

 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   # Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: Pt noted to have cholangitis and
   pancreatitis on ERCP examination, two stones were extracted from the
   ampulla and common hepatic duct, a sphincterotomy was performed. Pt
   received approx 4.5L  NS IVF hydration for his pancreatitis. LFTs and
   Lipase this AM show a downward trend.
   - Will continue Zosyn for enteric coverage and Vancomycin for Gram
   positive coverage
   - Will continue IVF 150cc/hr LR maintenance
   - NPO
   - Morphine 2-4mg  q4hr IV PRN pain
   .
   #. Hypotension: After induction yesterday pt was noted to be
   hypotensive to the SBP 70s, on arrival to the floor pt was on pressor
   support however after transfer to his bed his MAPs were noted to be >65
   without pressor support. Since this event pt
s SBP have ranged from mid
   80s to 110s and appear to be fluid responsive. Current hypotension most
   likely hypovolemic given the fluid loss involved with pancreatitis.
   Will continue to IVF bolus with LR for a goal MAP >65.
   - IVF fluid for MAPs >65
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Pt has histroy of CKD with a baseline Creatinine of
   1.7-1.9. Pt's Creatinine currently elevated at 2.4 increased from 2.2.,
   most likely pre-renal versus ATN given his pancreatitis. In spite of
   the increase in pressure pt
s UOP has still remained borderline which
   may indicate a marker of pre-renal failure. However given the large
   amount of lfuids received since his ERCP his renal output has not shown
   any vast improvement. Will obtain urine lytes in case pt is in ATN and
   will eventually have an increase in UOP.
   - Will renally dose all medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Obtain urine lytes
   - Will currently hold on AEI and [**Last Name (un) **] therapy
   .
   # DM II: Per [**Name (NI) **] pt usually takes Glyburide 5mg once a day, will
   transition pt to insulin sliding scale particularly given his NPO
   status and likely increased insulin needs given his infectious state.
   - Check CBGs qACHS
   - Start on ISS and assess Lantus dose based on 24 hour insulin
   requirements
   - Will transition back to Glyburide prior to discharge
   - Will currently hold ACEI and [**Last Name (un) **] therapy given pt's current [**Last Name (un) **].
   .
   # systolic CHF: Pt on prior echo noted to have a reduced EF of 40% with
   a fixed Apical defect. Pt on afterload therapy with Lisinopril and
   Valsartan per [**Last Name (un) 2040**].
   - Will currently hold ACEI and [**Last Name (un) **] as pt has [**Last Name (un) **]
   - Will use caution with IVF hydration given depressed systolic function
   .
   #  Sinus Tachycardia: Pt has been tachycardic since presentation to the
   ED, although there was a period on the unti prior to the ERCP that his
   heart was in the normal range. Pt currently is afebrile, has low
   suspicion for PE given lack of hypoxia in relation to his level of
   tachycardia. Pt does seem to still be hypovolemic, will continue MIVF
   and monitor response and pt
s tachycardia. Pt is still receovering from
   a severe infection, may still be in  an inflammatory/infectious state.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, systolic heart failure, and acute pancreatitis. He underwent an ERCP procedure which showed two irregular stones in the common bile duct and common hepatic duct, as well as mild dilation of the biliary tree and drainage of infected black bile. The patient received approximately 4.5 liters of normal saline IV fluids for his pancreatitis. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), a heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/67 to 136/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 100%. The patient's physical examination revealed well-nourished elderly Caucasian male with eyes open and able to follow simple commands, no jugular venous distention, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, trachea midline, regular heart sounds, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, and soft abdomen with facial grimacing on palpation of the right upper quadrant. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, amylase, lipase, liver enzymes, and troponin T levels. The patient's serum creatinine level is 2"

","The patient is an elderly Caucasian male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II, and systolic heart failure (HFrEF). He presented to the hospital with symptoms consistent with acute cholangitis and acute pancreatitis. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) which revealed two irregular stones in the common bile duct and common hepatic duct. A sphincterotomy was performed, and the stones were extracted.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, mild hypotension, and an increased respiratory rate. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). He was admitted with abdominal pain, nausea, and tachycardia. Laboratory tests and CT scan suggested cholangitis and pancreatitis. During ERCP, large stones in the ampulla and common hepatic duct were retrieved with sphincterotomy. The patient was electively intubated before the procedure and experienced a drop in pressures requiring neosynephrine. After arrival at [**Name (NI) 1**], the patient was extubated, and pressors were weaned off. The patient remained in the 110's, and his systolic blood pressure (SBP) drifted to the 80's, necessitating fluid resuscitation. He also had low-grade fevers.

24-hour events included:
- SBP drifts to 80's requiring fluid resuscitation.
- Low-grade fevers.
- No significant changes in other vital signs.

Medications:
- Morphine sulfate infusion started on 12/20/2122 at 03:20 AM.
- Heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started on 12/20/2122 at 06:14 AM.
- Other medications include aspirin.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing medical conditions, including acute pancreatitis, acute myocardial infarction (NSTEM"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for cholangitis and pancreatitis following an ERCP procedure. The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), oliguria/anuria, and elevated creatinine levels. He also has acute myocardial infarction with elevated cardiac markers. The patient is currently hypotensive and requires pressor support. He is experiencing abdominal pain, tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and diminished peripheral pulses. His respiratory status is stable, but he is tachycardic and has low oxygen saturation. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of 1.7-1.9. He is currently on insulin for diabetes management and has a reduced ejection fraction of 40% with a fixed apical defect. The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored closely, and he is on various medications for his conditions, including anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's worsening renal function, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels, suggests the possibility of AKI. This could be due to a combination of factors such as dehydration, use of nephrotoxic medications, or underlying chronic kidney disease.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's"

 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   # Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: Pt noted to have cholangitis and
   pancreatitis on ERCP examination, two stones were extracted from the
   ampulla and common hepatic duct, a sphincterotomy was performed. Pt
   received approx 4.5L  NS IVF hydration for his pancreatitis. LFTs and
   Lipase this AM show a downward trend.
   - Will continue Zosyn for enteric coverage and Vancomycin for Gram
   positive coverage
   - Will continue IVF 150cc/hr LR maintenance
   - Will trial on clears and ADAT
   - Morphine 2-4mg  q4hr IV PRN pain
   - Pt still hypovolemic, Pancreatitis fluid needs similar to burn pt
   needs, will continue 500cc LR bolus x 2. Pt
s PO intake should also
   increase with clear diet in place.
   .
   #. Hypotension: After induction yesterday pt was noted to be
   hypotensive to the SBP 70s, on arrival to the floor pt was on pressor
   support however after transfer to his bed his MAPs were noted to be >65
   without pressor support. Since this event pt
s SBP have ranged from mid
   80s to 110s and appear to be fluid responsive. Current hypotension most
   likely hypovolemic given the fluid loss involved with pancreatitis.
   Will continue to IVF bolus with LR for a goal MAP >65.
   - IVF fluid for MAPs >65
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Pt has histroy of CKD with a baseline Creatinine of
   1.7-1.9. Pt's Creatinine currently elevated at 2.4 increased from 2.2.,
   most likely pre-renal versus ATN given his pancreatitis. In spite of
   the increase in pressure pt
s UOP has still remained borderline which
   may indicate a marker of pre-renal failure.
   - Will renally dose all medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Obtain urine lytes
   - Will currently hold on AEI and [**Last Name (un) **] therapy
   .
   # DM II: Per [**Name (NI) **] pt usually takes Glyburide 5mg once a day, will
   transition pt to insulin sliding scale particularly given his NPO
   status and likely increased insulin needs given his infectious state.
   - Check CBGs qACHS
   - Will continue ISS as pt is only on clears diet, will switch to Lantus
   coverage when pt tolerates solid PO.
   - Will transition back to Glyburide prior to discharge
   - Will currently hold ACEI and [**Last Name (un) **] therapy given pt's current [**Last Name (un) **].
   .
   # systolic CHF: Pt on prior echo noted to have a reduced EF of 40% with
   a fixed Apical defect. Pt on afterload therapy with Lisinopril and
   Valsartan per [**Last Name (un) 2040**].
   - Will currently hold ACEI and [**Last Name (un) **] as pt has [**Last Name (un) **]
   - Will use caution with IVF hydration given depressed systolic function
   .
   #  Sinus Tachycardia: Pt has been sinus tachycardic overnight, sinus
   tachycardia most likely a component of his still present hypovolemia
   and pain.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II, systolic heart failure, and a recent episode of pancreatitis. He presented to the emergency department with cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. Since then, he has been in the ICU for ongoing management.

24-hour events:
- Advanced to clear liquids
- FENa was 0.5% and urinalysis showed 3 WBC, few bacteria, but negative leukocyte esterase and nitrites
- Given 500 cc and 250 cc LR bolus today
- HR slowly trended up, appeared to be sinus tachycardia
- Foley catheter was removed due to persistent discomfort
- Labs showed worsening acute renal failure (ARF) with creatinine increasing from 2.4 to 3.6 and potassium increasing to 5.5. Started on metoprolol for tachycardia and kayexalate for hyperkalemia
- UOP continues to decrease throughout the day, possibly indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal consult today. Fluid boluses did not help
- Previously on pressors only during ERCP, now extubated and doing well
- Unable to provide history due to language barrier
- No known drug allergies
- Last dose of antibiotics: Vancomycin on 12/19/22 at 07:26"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of deafness who has undergone an ERCP procedure. He initially presented with sepsis and two stones were removed. The patient successfully underwent extubation and weaning off pressors. However, he has developed early renal failure with suggestions of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as the primary insult. There has been some improvement in the abdominal exam, but the patient continues to have persistent renal failure.

The patient's medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cholangitis: The patient is already on antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn), and the plan is to continue advancing his diet per GI. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis is crucial.

2. Acute Renal Failure (likely ATN): The patient's urine output is severely impaired, indicating oliguria/anuria. Maintaining euvolemia, following urine output, consulting with a renal specialist, and administering renal dose medications are necessary to manage this condition.

3. Sepsis: Despite the ongoing antibiotic course, the patient's WBC count remains elevated. Continuous monitoring of the exam for recurrence of sepsis is essential, and the patient should be encouraged to mobilize early.

Other potential medical complications mentioned in the note include pancreatitis, myocardial infarction (AMI), and DVT. However, there is no specific information provided about these conditions at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for cholangitis and now presents with acute renal failure, respiratory failure, pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, oliguria/anuria, and hypotension. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with baseline creatinine levels of 1.7-1.9. His current creatinine level is 5.9, indicating worsening renal function. The patient also has metabolic acidosis, likely lactic acidosis, and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with a femoral dialysis line. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has ARF with an elevated creatinine level from 1.7-1.9 to 5.9. This could be due to multiple factors such as sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxins. The patient is on CVVH and renal dosing of medications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, likely secondary to prolonged hyperventilation with metabolic acidosis. He is intubated and receiving sedation with fentanyl and versed.
3. Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with a history of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and subsequent development of cholangitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has experienced several complications.

24-hour events include the initiation of multi-lumen IV access, trans-thoracic echo, blood cultures, and various medications such as heparin sodium, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 107/42 mmHg and tachycardia with a heart rate of 105 bpm. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation remains at 97%. The patient's temperature is mildly elevated at 36.9°C.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight/obese general appearance. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, while peripheral pulses are diminished bilaterally in the radial and dorsal pedis arteries. Respiratory examination reveals symmetric chest expansion with diminished breath sounds at the lung bases. Abdominal examination indicates non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and distension. Extremities show 1+ edema in both legs without cyanosis. Neurologic examination demonstrates attentive behavior, following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, purposeful movements, and normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, mildly"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for acute kidney injury (ARF) after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for cholangitis.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues:

1. Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: The patient had cholangitis and pancreatitis during the ERCP examination. Two stones were extracted from the ampulla and common hepatic duct, and a sphincterotomy was performed. The patient received approximately 4.5 liters of normal saline intravenous fluid hydration for his pancreatitis. Liver function tests (LFTs) show a downward trend.

2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced recurrent hypotension, initially noted to be in the 70s systolic blood pressure (SBP), and later improved to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 without the need for pressor support. Possible etiologies include cardiac ischemia with continuing elevated cardiac enzymes (CK and Troponin-T), pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac tamponade (although the electrocardiogram (EKG) has remained unchanged), or sepsis. Bilateral large bore lines have been ordered, cycling central venous pressure (CVP), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and continuous renal monitoring for possible pressors overnight. Fluid boluses are to be given as needed.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (CKD): The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level of 1.7-1.9. His current creatinine level is elevated to 4.3, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal dosing of medications, avoidance of nephrotoxins, trend creatinine, obtain urine electrolytes, and hold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and [Last Name (un)] therapy have been advised.

4. Diabetes Mellitus Type II (DM II): The patient is on insulin for glycemic control, and his usual oral hypoglycemic agent (Glyburide) has been temporarily discontinued. Regular blood glucose monitoring is recommended, and the patient will transition back to Glyburide prior to discharge.

5. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure (systolic CHF): The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 40% with a fixed apical defect. Medications such as Lisinopril and Valsartan have been prescribed. The patient's angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and [Last Name (un)] therapy have been temporarily held. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with admission for CBD stone complicated by cholangitis and
   had ERCP for relief of obstruction .  This has been complicated by ARF
   and hypotension.  Patient does have persistent elevation in CK with
   slight trend down.  He remains with mild elevations of transaminases
   but no trend to increase.   Importantly he does have continued near
   anuria and increase in Cr to 6.0 today. By problems
   1)Hypotension
Most likely a combination of pre-load dependent state
   with improvement with volume support and with CVP now elevated have
   been able to wean pressors to off this morning.  As far as the acute
   changes of yesterday PE is possible, acute transmural injury appears
   less likely to myocardium based on ECHO and ECG.  Enzymes are
   equivocal.  He does hot have fever, WBC is falling, no evidence of
   pericardial tamponade.  In regards to intra-abdominal source exam has
   been stable.
   -Will wean Levophed to off
   -Would Rx for PE empirically with heparin until able to reassure
   -Will check Lipase, Amylase, Lactate, LFT
s today and follow exam
   -Follow CVP
   2)Acute Renal Failure
Significant and persistent anuria and need for
   CVVH based upon volume, acidemia
   -CVVH today
   -Heparin to hold prior to line placement
   -Will need HCO3- replacement
   -VBG
s for acid base process

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted for cholangitis and acute renal failure. He underwent an ERCP procedure but developed complications including hypotension and anuria. The patient's condition has been stable, with mild elevations in transaminases but no worsening trends. However, there is a significant increase in creatinine to 6.0, indicating worsening renal function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be preload-dependent, and he has shown improvement with volume support. The possibility of a pulmonary embolism (PE) should also be considered, as it can cause acute changes and hypotension. Further investigation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) may be necessary to manage the volume, acidemia, and electrolyte imbalances. Acid-base status will need to be closely monitored and corrected accordingly.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis is being managed with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Antibiotic therapy should continue, and the underlying cause of the cholangitis should be addressed.

Other Considerations:
- Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest acute pancreatitis. Monitoring and supportive care are essential.
- Myocardial Infarction: The"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient now presents with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), oliguria/anuria, acute pancreatitis, and suspected myocardial infarction.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to hyperventilation for more than 24 hours with metabolic acidosis. He is intubated and receiving sedation with fentanyl and versed. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 218.

The patient has ARF with a baseline creatinine of 1.7-1.9 and current creatinine of 5.9. There is also evidence of metabolic acidosis, possibly lactic acidosis. Renal dosing of medications is being done, and efforts are being made to avoid nephrotoxins. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been initiated.

The patient also has evidence of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis, as stones were extracted from the ampulla and common hepatic duct during the ERCP procedure. His"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for acute cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Since then, he has developed respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pancreatitis, and suspected myocardial infarction. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine levels between 1.7-1.9, and his current creatinine level is 4.0 after starting continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) yesterday. His bicarbonate level also improved from 14 to 19 this morning. The patient's urine output has been low, with only 23 mL in the last 24 hours. He is currently on pressure support and receiving sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning to pressure support may be attempted today.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and/or hypotension. His serum creatinine has risen to 4.0, indicating significant kidney dysfunction. CVVH has been initiated, and efforts are being made to optimize fluid and electrolyte balance."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. The patient was admitted after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for cholangitis and is currently experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction.

The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.7-1.9 and his creatinine peaked at 6.0 prior to starting continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The etiology of ARF is still uncertain, as muddy brown casts were not present on the urine exam yesterday. The patient is currently on renal dosing medications including vancomycin every 24 hours while on CVVH. The goal is to maintain an even I-O today and keep the patient stable, avoiding diuresis if possible. If the patient is sedated, it is important to have a family member or interpreter present to explain the situation, particularly regarding CVVH.

The patient also has respiratory failure and is intubated. There is a plan to wean sedation and attempt extubation today if possible. A chest X-ray will be performed to check for evidence of pulmonary edema. Inhalers will be started today, and the ABG will be re"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with biliarly obstruction and now s/p ERCP and patient with
   worsening renal failure in the setting of resolving sepsis patient with
   intubation in the setting of severe volume overload an acidosis.   CVVH
   not started.  He has had improved BP with support with IVF and pressors
   have remained off.  He has had continued metabolic acidosis but much
   improved with CVVH to HCO3-=18.  Mild respiratory acidosis remains but
   is likely related to sedating effects of medicaiton.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-
   -CXR today given new evolution of wheezing noted with some
   unilaterality
   -Wean sedation with low RR seen in the setting of mild resp acidosis
   -Continue to wean PSV and move to extubation today
   -Continue bronchodilators with good response seen over time
   -Main concern as barrier to extubation may well be volume overload in
   the setting of CVP elevation and 2 liters positive across the day
   -With extubation will need to provide sign language
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-
   -Continue CVVH
   -Acidosis which is non-gap has shown some reasonable improvement wth
   CVVH
   -Likely contribution from renal failure as primary driver with NS given
   yesterday
   -He remains with near anuric state
 OLIGURIA/ANURIA
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE-
   -Much improved on enzyme testing
   -Will maintain npo until good evidence of return of bowel function seen
   Hypotension-
   -Patient with adequate CVP
   -He has preserved cardiac function
   -No evidence of autopeep impairing effective filling
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be decreased SVR as primary driver
he does not show signs of
   sepsis
   -Will need to continue Heparin gtt for now
   -Lactate, repeat cultures,  cortisol, TSH if unrevealing, fungal
   cultures
   -Vanco/Zosyn

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of biliary obstruction, now post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and worsening renal failure in the setting of resolving sepsis.
- The patient has intubation due to severe volume overload and acidosis.
- CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been started and has improved the patient's blood chemistry, including metabolic acidosis.
- The patient also has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and is being weaned off sedation with a low respiratory rate.
- The main concern for extubation is volume overload in the setting of CVP (central venous pressure) elevation and 2 liters positive across the day.
- The patient remains oliguric/anuric, indicating reduced urine output.
- Pancreatitis is much improved.
- Hypotension is being managed by maintaining an adequate CVP, preserved cardiac function, and decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
- There are no signs of sepsis, so heparin will be continued, along with repeat lactate, cultures, cortisol, TSH, and fungal cultures if necessary.
- The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
- ICU care includes nutrition via nasogastric tube, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. Post-procedure, he developed respiratory failure and acute renal failure. He also has pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, hypotension, leukocytosis, and possible ileus. The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to hyperventilation and worsening metabolic acidosis. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which could be attributed to various factors such as sepsis, nephrotoxic medications, or underlying chronic kidney disease. He is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient is producing very little urine, indicating oliguria or anuria. This may be a result of acute renal failure or other underlying conditions.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which could be related to his recent ERCP procedure. He is at risk for complications such as pancreatic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for cholangitis and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure (ARF), acute renal failure (ARF), pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level of 1.7-1.9. His creatinine peaked at 6.0 prior to starting continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The cause of the ARF is still unknown, with the absence of muddy brown casts observed on the microscopic urine exam. The patient has a bicarbonate level that is stable but still shows a metabolic gap and non-gap acidosis.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to prolonged hyperventilation for more than 24 hours, leading to worsening metabolic acidosis. He also has respiratory acidosis with a low respiratory rate on pressure support (PS) 8/5. The plan is to wean sedation and try to extubate him late in the afternoon if possible.

   respiratory failiure.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
he has barriers to
   extubation of altered mental status and mild volume overload.  He has
   made some meaningful negative fluid balance.  Given favorable RSBI,
   negative fluid balance will move to SBT.
   -SBT x 30 minutes
   -Check ABG at 30 minutes
   -If favorable witll attempt extubation today
   -If unfavorable with SBT then would return to CVVH with negative fluid
   balance
   -Sepsis
He has persistent and intermittent hypotension
this is in the
   setting of volume removal
and continued treatment for original insult.
   He has concern raised for C. diff with elevation in WBC count.
   -C. Diff culture
   -Will hold on CT scan given need for contrast, reassuring abdominal
   exam, KUB without obstruction when confirmed from radiology
   -Would provide empiric Rx for C. Diff
with Flagyl

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension. He was admitted with cholangitis and post-intervention complications, including acute renal failure, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being managed for several medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for 30 minutes, check an arterial blood gas (ABG) at 30 minutes, and attempt extubation if the SBT is favorable. If the SBT is unfavorable, the patient will return to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with negative fluid balance.

2. Sepsis: The patient has persistent and intermittent hypotension in the setting of volume removal. This is being treated for the original insult. Additionally, there are concerns raised for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection due to an elevated white blood cell count. A C. diff culture will be done, and empiric treatment with Flagyl will be provided.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure. CVVH will continue, and a negative fluid balance will be maintained today. An HD catheter is already in place.

4. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient is experiencing decreased urine output.

5. Acute Pancre"

   -Per ERCP fellow- has ileus. Likely needs to wait it out. Consider TPN.
   KUB consist with ileus. Could possibly have abscess but would need CT

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. Post-procedure, he developed respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, ileus, and ongoing management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had episodes of respiratory failure and required intubation. There is concern for ongoing respiratory distress, and daily chest X-rays will be reviewed to assess for atelectasis and possible effusion.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Fluid balance should be carefully monitored, and efforts will be made to remove fluids with CVVH if the patient can be weaned off pressors.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis with ongoing inflammation. His condition should be monitored for any signs of worsening, and he will be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) for now.
4. Myocardial Infarction: The patient had an acute myocardial infarction, and his cardiac enzymes (CK and Troponin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. The patient was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. Since then, the patient has developed several medical complications.

The patient has respiratory failure, acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction. The patient's respiratory failure is likely not associated with ARDS. The acute renal failure may be due to the underlying CKD, as the patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.7-1.9 and peaked at 6.0 prior to starting CVVH. The presence of non-gap acidosis with bicarbonate levels stable suggests a metabolic cause for the renal failure.

The patient also has evidence of pancreatitis and cholangitis, as indicated by the ERCP examination showing stones in the ampulla and common hepatic duct. The patient is currently experiencing ileus, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's hypotension after the ERCP procedure could be due to various causes such as cardiac ischemia, pulmonary embolism, tamponade, sepsis, or other factors. The patient is currently on pressor support, and further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause.

Additionally, the patient has diabetes mellitus type II, systolic congestive"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with initial presentation with biliary obstruction and
   patient had failed extubation yesterday with what was likely related to
   significant evolution of pulmonary edema which may be related to volume
   overload and resultant wheezing as upper airway patency seemed adequate
   at re-intubation.  He now is faced with substantial rise in WBC count
   despite start for C. Diff Rx yesterday.  This may be in part
   attributable to SIRS insult from re-intubation yesterday.  This raises
   question of focal collection in abdomen with superinfection of
   pancreatitis.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-
   -Continue with PSV
   -Will need adequate volume removal prior to next attempt at extubation
   -CXR reassuring
   -Continue with steroids for upper airway patency

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of biliary obstruction who presented with respiratory failure, hypotension, and renal failure. The patient underwent invasive ventilation and had recurrent hypotension requiring re-intubation due to substantial central airways wheezing. The patient also has ileus noted on CT scan and is unable to create a negative fluid balance. The patient's condition is complicated by transient esophageal intubation and likely aspiration of bilious contents. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, which is not consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The plan is to continue with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and ensure adequate volume removal before attempting extubation again. Chest X-ray is reassuring, and steroids will be continued for upper airway patency.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and fluid removal should be held. Urine output is minimal, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) should be continued.

3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient is experiencing minimal urine output.

4. Acute Pancreatitis: Although the patient's pancreatic enzymes have normalized, fluid management for pancreatitis will be continued.

5. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's cardiac enzymes have improved in the setting of acute respiratory failure from yesterday.

6. Sepsis/Hypotension: There is concern for toxic megacolon,"

   -Per renal- if can do CVVH taking 50cc off per hour, and BP stable,
   could be candidate for HD Sat or mon. Talking to attg re: ability for
   contrast and CT. Also, weigh risks and benefits of contrast PRN.
   -Per ERCP fellow- has ileus. Likely needs to wait it out. Consider TPN.
   KUB consist with ileus. Could possibly have abscess but would need CT

   today
    #Leukocytosis:WBC jumped today from 25 to 40. ? etiology- abscess in
   belly, C diff, PNA (CXR not with sign evidence of infxn)
   - CT abd/pelvis w/ PO contrast WET READ showed pancreatitis (can't
   determine if necrosis without IV contrast), no evidence of obstruction
   or dilation of bowel, small pleural effusions and atelectasis, Possibly
   small focal colonic wall thickening, 3rd spacing with edema,
   retroperitoneal fluid and trace free fluid in pelvis and sm amt
   ascites, nothing tapable.
 Cultures all continuing negative.
   - Will chk c diff if has any stools.
   - Culture from all lines pending
   # Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: Pt noted to have cholangitis and
   pancreatitis on ERCP examination, two stones were extracted from the
   ampulla and common hepatic duct, a sphincterotomy was performed [**12-19**].

   for this. Abd CT today without evidence of perf, abscess, tapable fluid
   collection, CDiff
   - LFTs continuing downward trend
   - Will continue vanc/  Zosyn/flagyl for enteric coverage at renal
   dosing
   - NPO continued for now- PPN ordered for today
   # Hypotension: After ERCP [**12-19**] pt was noted to be hypotensive to the
   SBP 70s, on arrival to the floor pt was on pressor support however
   after transfer to his bed his MAPs were noted to be >65 without pressor
   support.  Pt again hypotensive \ not responsive to fluids.  ? etiology
   cardiac ischemia with continuing CK and trop elevation, PE, tamponade
   (but EKG unchanged), sepsis. Off levo since am [**12-23**]. ? PE. Bilat LENI

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. Post-procedure, he developed respiratory failure and was intubated. He also has acute renal failure and pancreatitis. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, leukocytosis, ileus, and possible abdominal abscess. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, antidiabetics, and cardiac support. The patient's medical team is monitoring his condition closely and is considering further interventions such as CVVH, HD, and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and prolonged intubation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atelectasis, and lung infection.
2. Renal Complications: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a possibility of further deterioration in kidney function. This could lead to the need for ongoing renal support or dialysis.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, which may progress to necrosis or develop complications like pseudocysts or abscesses.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and ileus raise concerns about the possibility of an abdominal abscess or infection. This would require appropriate imaging and antibiotic management"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2122-12-25**]
   -Extubated in am but re-intubated [**12-21**] wheeze despite heliox, nebs,
   steroids.  Reintubation complicated by intubation into esophagus with
   aspiration as lg amts bile suctioned from lungs after placement of ETT
   in trachea.
   -Per renal- if can do CVVH taking 50cc off per hour, and BP stable,
   could be candidate for HD Sat or mon. Talking to attg re: ability for
   contrast and CT. Also, weigh risks and benefits of contrast PRN.
   -Per ERCP fellow- has ileus. Likely needs to wait it out. Consider TPN.
   KUB consist with ileus. Could possibly have abscess but would need CT
   for that (best would be with IV contrast). Hard abd is stable since
   admission.
   -Hypotensive around midnight. Stopped taking fluid off with CVVH and
   placed back on Levo.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ h/o congenital deafness, HTN, DM, CAD, osteoarthritis and L
   subclavian steal syndrome admitted s/p ERCP for cholangitis now with
   ARF s/p  resp failure.
   # Resp failure:  Initially intubated on [**12-22**] because of MSK respiratory
   fatigue in setting of metabolic acidosis with respiratory
   compensation.  Pt did well on [**3-23**] and with trial of 5/0 in am [**12-25**] and
   was extubated. Subsequently, pt with significant wheeze although has O2
   sat in high 90
s- tried heliox, nebs, steroids but was ultimately
   reintubated for concern for MSK respiratory fatigue.  Wheezes may have
   been caused by pulmonary edema.
   -Maintain pressure support

   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Will currently hold on AEI and [**Last Name (un) **] therapy
   -F/u any other renal recs
   -Will try to remove fluids with CVVH
    #Leukocytosis:  WBC count peaked at approximately 40.  Possible
   etiologies include abscess in abdomen, C diff, PNA (CXR not with sign
   evidence of infxn).  Cultures remain negative
   - CT abd/pelvis w/ PO contrast WET READ showed pancreatitis (can't
   determine if necrosis without IV contrast), no evidence of obstruction
   or dilation of bowel, small pleural effusions and atelectasis, Possibly
   small focal colonic wall thickening, 3rd spacing with edema,
   retroperitoneal fluid and trace free fluid in pelvis and sm amt
   ascites, nothing tapable.
   - continue to culture for fevers
   - f/u c diff if has any stools
   - continue flagyl empirically for c. diff, zosyn and vanc for
   pancreatitis/cholangitis
   - Culture from all lines pending
   # Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: Pt noted to have cholangitis and
   pancreatitis on ERCP examination, two stones were extracted from the
   ampulla and common hepatic duct, a sphincterotomy was performed [**12-19**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for cholangitis and is now experiencing acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, pancreatitis, and hypotension. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory fatigue and has undergone an ERCP procedure. He is currently on prolonged mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is being treated for various conditions including pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and sepsis. The patient's renal function is compromised, and he requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with fluid restriction. His blood glucose levels are being monitored closely due to diabetes mellitus. The patient also has a history of systolic heart failure and is on afterload therapy with Lisinopril and Valsartan. His current code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient has been intubated multiple times and is currently on prolonged mechanical ventilation with pressure support. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory muscle weakness.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and his creatinine levels have peaked at 6.0. He is currently undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CV"

   maintain continued negative fluid balance with CVVH going forward as
   primary insult leading to re-intubation.  Somewhat reassuring is the
   capacity to remove fluid further.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of a PE. The note mentions the possibility of a PE and plans to continue heparin therapy and consider a chest CTA when renal function returns to baseline.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory fatigue and metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Although the patient was extubated, they experienced significant wheezing and were reintubated. The note indicates the need for pressure support and nebs ATC.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine of 1.7-1.9. The patient's creatinine peaked at 6.0 prior to starting continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The note mentions the absence of muddy brown casts on microscopic urine exam, which suggests another etiology for ARF. The patient is undergoing CVVH to remove fluids and is receiving renal dosing medications, including vancomycin.

4. Cholangitis and pancreatitis: The patient underwent an ERCP procedure for cholangitis and pancreatitis. Stones were extracted from the ampulla and common hepatic duct, and a sphincterotomy was performed. The patient is currently on"

   # Resp failure:  Initial respiratory failure presumed due to volume
   overload in the setting of acute kidney injury and anuria.  Failed
   previous attempt at extubation due to wheezing and presumed continued
   fluid overload.  Currently, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally
   and CVVH was able to remove fluid yesterday.  Therefore presumed
   etiology of extubation failure reversed and patient had spontaneous

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is cholangitis, sepsis, and hypoxia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several medical interventions.

1. The patient has a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome.
2. The patient presented with respiratory failure, presumed due to volume overload in the setting of acute kidney injury and anuria. Previous attempts at extubation were unsuccessful due to wheezing and presumed continued fluid overload. However, the patient's lungs are currently clear to auscultation bilaterally, and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) was able to remove fluid yesterday. Therefore, the presumed etiology of extubation failure has reversed, and the patient had a spontaneous breathing trial this morning with stable ventilation and oxygenation. The plan is to extubate the patient.
3. The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a baseline creatinine of 1.7-1.9. The patient's creatinine peaked at 6.0 prior to starting CVVH. The etiology of ARF with the absence of muddy brown casts originally on microscopic urine exam is still uncertain. Renal dosing of medications, including vancomycin Q24 while on CVVH, is being implemented."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, ileus, pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 136/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure presumed due to volume overload in the setting of acute kidney injury and anuria. There have been previous attempts at extubation that were unsuccessful. Currently, the patient's lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was able to remove fluid yesterday. Therefore, the presumed etiology of extubation failure has reversed, and the patient had a spontaneous breathing trial this morning with stable ventilation and oxygenation. Extubation is planned.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level of 1.7"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. The patient is now experiencing multiple medical complications, including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, acute pancreatitis, and possible myocardial infarction.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to volume overload, metabolic acidosis, and fatigue. After failed extubation, he was reintubated but successfully extubated on [**12-28**]. His lungs are now clear bilaterally, and he is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with baseline creatinine levels of 1.7-1.9. His creatinine peaked at 6.0 before starting CVVH. The etiology of ARF is uncertain, with no muddy brown casts observed on microscopic urine examination. Renal replacement therapy, including CVVH and hemodialysis (HD), has been initiated.

3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has reduced urine output, which may be related to his renal failure.

4. Acute Pancreatitis"

   - tunneled HD line planned in IR on Thurs.
   #Leukocytosis/C difficile colitis:  WBC count peaked at approximately
   40.  Cultures remain negative and CT showed no abcess or drainable
   fluid collection though continued pancreatitis.  Presumed etiology is
   C. diff.   .
   - continue to culture for fevers
   - C diff sent now that [**Last Name (LF) 5699**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] follow results
   - continue flagyl and PO vanco empirically for c. diff (anticipate 14
   day course) could stop metronidazole once confirmed diagnosis
    # Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: Pt noted to have cholangitis and
   pancreatitis on ERCP examination, two stones were extracted from the
   ampulla and common hepatic duct, a sphincterotomy was performed [**12-19**].
   ERCP fellow [**12-24**] stated still has ileus s/p procedure and no further tx
   for this. Abd CT [**12-26**] without evidence of perf, abscess, tapable fluid
   collection, Cdiff. LFTs normalized as of [**12-29**]
   - Today is last day of vancomycin/pip-tazo treatment for cholangitis
   - patient tolerating clear liquids, will continue to monitor
    # Hypotension: After ERCP [**12-19**] pt was noted to be hypotensive to the
   SBP 70s, on arrival to the floor pt was on pressor support however
   after transfer to his bed his MAPs were noted to be >65 without pressor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications. These include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is suspected to have a PE, which is a blockage in one or more arteries in the lungs. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate treatment.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to volume overload and metabolic acidosis. Although the patient's current oxygen saturation (SpO2) is good, there may still be ongoing respiratory issues.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. This is a serious condition where the kidneys suddenly stop working properly.

4. Oliguria/anuria: The patient is experiencing decreased urine output, which is a sign of kidney dysfunction.

5. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas. This condition can lead to complications such as infection or organ failure.

6. Myocardial infarction (MI): The patient had an acute myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack. This is indicated by elevated cardiac markers (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T) and symptoms like chest pain.

7. Cholangitis: The patient had cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. This condition often requires intervention through procedures like ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography).

8. C. diff colitis: The patient is suspected to have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which is a bacterial infection of the colon. This can cause severe diarrhea and abdominal pain.

9. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive at times, indicating low blood pressure. This can be due to various causes, including sepsis, heart problems, or fluid loss.

10. Cardiac ischemia: The patient has had ongoing cardiac ischemia, which means there is reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. This can lead to further complications if not treated promptly.

11. Ileus: The patient has ileus, which is a condition where digestion and bowel movement are temporarily slowed or stopped. This can occur after abdominal surgery or as a result of certain medications.

12. History of congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of systolic CHF and is on afterload therapy with Lisinopril and Valsartan. The patient also has moderate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and a slightly reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 45-50%).

13. Diabetes mellitus type II (DM II): The patient has DM II and is usually on Glyburide 5mg once a day. The patient is currently on insulin for glycemic control.

14. History of subclavian steal syndrome: The patient has a history of subclavian steal syndrome, a condition where there"

   through tomorrow
   - NPO continued for now but cont TPN today
    # Hypotension: After ERCP [**12-19**] pt was noted to be hypotensive to the
   SBP 70s, on arrival to the floor pt was on pressor support however
   after transfer to his bed his MAPs were noted to be >65 without pressor
   support.  Pt again hypotensive \ not responsive to fluids.  ? etiology
   cardiac ischemia with continuing CK and trop elevation, PE, tamponade
   (but EKG unchanged), sepsis. Off levo since am [**12-23**]. ? PE. Bilat LENI
