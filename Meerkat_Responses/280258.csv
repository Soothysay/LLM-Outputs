   complicated by intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy and
   current hypoxemia.
   .
   # Hypoxemia, fevers: Likely pneumonia.  Patient growing enterobacter
   cloacae which is pan-sensitive.  Continues to spike, however, despite
   broad coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis
   with metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today was in the context of
   worsening secretions; could have had mucous plugging.  In addition
   enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer
   responding to the therapy. s/p extubation on [**11-21**].
   - ID consult, follow up recs
   - d/c Vanc and Flagyl
   - Continue Meropenem x14 day course, D1 = [**11-21**], d/c after [**12-6**]
   - Lasix prn as pt
s respiratory status and hypoxia improved with
   aggressive diuresis
   - Additional Lasix 80mg IV now
   - Intubate electively given acute desat this morning, likely mucus plug
   which is unable to be suctioned up
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Monitoring Na closely.
   - Increased free water flushes to 250mL Q4h
   - check pm lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission. Now
   holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products given
   stable over several days.  Minimal bleeding with suctioning.  On [**11-23**]
   patient had 2 units PRBC transfused without appropriate increase in
   hct, but no clear source of bleeding. CT head, torso yesterday ([**11-24**])
   showed no source of bleeding.
   - daily coags, HCT
   - transfuse as necessary
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: Occurred on [**2156-11-11**] and in setting of liver
   disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes
   ([**11-13**] and [**11-16**]) and neuro exam stable as above.
   - cont dilantin for seizure ppx, follow levels; per neurosurgery, pt
   will need to continue on dilantin until his h/s f/u in 1 mo w. head CT
   - daily neurology exams, follow INR and CBC daily
   - fall precautions, low bed
   - f/u plastics recs
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hypoxia Improving. Was
   secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy.
   The patient has known decompensated liver disease with a previous
   history of encephalopathy.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   .
   #. Anemia: Likely due to head wound bleeding.
   - Daily HCTs, coags as above
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will monitor NGT output for bleeding
   .
   #. ESLD: No viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 26. In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per neurosurgery are non-operative.
   Does not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 363**] in 4 weeks with a non-contrast head  CT.
   Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8464**] to schedule an appointment on the [**Location (un) 9850**] of the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 9838**] - [**Hospital Unit Name 9839**].

   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: Podiatry saw and signed off. Likely mild
   cellulitis treated with broad spec abx. Needs out pt f/u
   - make outpt f/u apt
   .
   # FEN: Follow nutrition recommendations. Start tubefeeds, 250cc free
   water flushes q4h. Replete lytes prn.
   # PPX: PPI IV BID for now assuming there are varices/gastritis, no
   heparin, bowel regimen, venodynes
   # CODE: Full code.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is indicated by low oxygen levels (SpO2: 96%) and abnormal ABG values (7.44/52/51/31/9). This may be due to pneumonia or mucous plugging.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a growing enterobacter cloacae infection, which is pan-sensitive. However, the patient continues to spike fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. This suggests a possible pneumonia that is not responding to the current treatment.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels (Na: 143 mEq/L), indicating hypernatremia. This could be due to inadequate fluid intake or excessive losses.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of mild disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hepatic dysfunction. There is also evidence of minimal bleeding with suctioning. Close monitoring of coagulation factors and blood products will be necessary.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, likely secondary to hypoxia. This could be improving as the respiratory status improves. Previous causes include intraparenchymal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to head wound bleeding. Daily HCTs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, recurrent encephalopathy, prolonged hospitalization resulting in aspiration pneumonia and intracranial hemorrhage. He is currently in the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory distress, and gross fluid overload. His prognosis is poor due to chronic illness. The patient requires intubation and discussion of tracheostomy with the family. He is on imipenem for Enterobacter PNA and dilantin for intracranial hemorrhage. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to protect his airway and aspirate puts him at risk for further respiratory distress and failure.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, indicating a potential risk for developing hypothermia due to prolonged ICU stay.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest a possible impairment in renal function.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen his mental status.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT/PTT and elevated INR indicate a risk of bleeding complications.
6. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient is still at risk for developing additional infections due to his compromised immune system.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted multiple times for pneumonia, subdural hematoma, altered mental status, fever, and hypoxemia. He has a history of alcohol abuse and has developed complications such as ascites, varices, and encephalopathy.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. There is improvement in lung aeration, but persistent pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis. The ABG (arterial blood gas) demonstrates respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.
2. Fever: The patient has had recurrent fevers, which are likely due to pneumonia. Enterobacter cloacae has been identified, which is pan-sensitive. However, the patient continues to spike fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, and measures are being taken to address this.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of mild DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) on admission. Currently, there is no active bleeding, and coagulation factors are being monitored.
5. Head bleed: The patient had a fall resulting in an intracranial bleed. Repeat scans show no significant changes, and the neuro exam is stable. Dil"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, recurrent encephalopathy, and respiratory distress. He was intubated due to his inability to protect his airway. The patient also has left lung collapse, which has improved. He is currently receiving invasive ventilation and an arterial line. The patient's allergies include citalopram and shaking. His last dose of antibiotics was meropenem on 11/29/2156 at 08:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 120/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a weight of 90.5 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 911 mL and output of 4,315 mL.

The patient is receiving various medications such as propofol, furosemide (Lasix), rifaxamin, SSI, lactulose, insulin, MVI, dilantin, and vitamin K. He has been on meropenem until 12/6.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears thin, has peripheral pulses that are not assessed, and demonstrates trace lower extremity edema. His neurologic examination shows that he is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds not assessed, and"

 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and encephalopathy; course
   complicated by intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy and
   current hypoxemia.
   .
   # Hypoxemia, fevers: Likely pneumonia.  Patient growing enterobacter
   cloacae which is pan-sensitive.  Continues to spike, however, despite
   broad coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis
   with metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today was in the context of
   worsening secretions; could have had mucous plugging.  In addition
   enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer
   responding to the therapy. s/p extubation on [**11-21**].
   - Pt has been intubated 3 times this hospitalization, without
   improvement in his mental status.   He will need trach/PEG placement,
   as at this point it is unlikely that his mental status will improve
   such that he will be able to protect his airway.  Will email Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 412**] (surgery) for consult.
   - Given new fever spike, send bcx, ucx, sputum cx; cxr from today does
   not show evidence of infiltrate
   - Continue Meropenem x14 day course, D1 = [**11-21**], d/c after [**12-6**]
   - If pt clinically declines, consider paracentesis for SBP
   - Arrange trach placement
   - ID consult, follow up recs
   - Lasix prn as pt
s respiratory status and hypoxia improved with
   aggressive diuresis; hold today given borderline hypernatremia, but may
   increase free water flushes and add lasix later today if pt appears
   fluid overloaded
   - Wean PEEP as tolerated.
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Monitoring Na closely.
   - check PM sodium
   - Continue free water flushes; consider increasing flushes later today
   if Na increases
   .
   Stable/Non-active Issues:
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission. Now
   holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products given
   stable over several days.  Minimal bleeding with suctioning.  On [**11-23**]
   patient had 2 units PRBC transfused without appropriate increase in
   hct, but no clear source of bleeding. CT head, torso yesterday ([**11-24**])
   showed no source of bleeding.
   - daily coags, HCT
   - transfuse as necessary
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: Occurred on [**2156-11-11**] and in setting of liver
   disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes
   ([**11-13**] and [**11-16**]) and neuro exam stable as above.
   - cont dilantin for seizure ppx, follow levels; per neurosurgery, pt
   will need to continue on dilantin until his h/s f/u in 1 mo w. head CT
   - daily neurology exams, follow INR and CBC daily
   - fall precautions, low bed
   - f/u plastics recs
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hypoxia--Improving. Was
   secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy.
   The patient has known decompensated liver disease with a previous
   history of encephalopathy.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   .
   #. Anemia: Stable.
   - Daily HCTs, coags as above
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will monitor NGT output for bleeding
   .
   #. ESLD: No viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is 28 ([**11-29**]). In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per neurosurgery are non-operative.
   Does not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 363**] in 4 weeks with a non-contrast head CT.
   Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8464**] to schedule an appointment on the [**Location (un) 9850**] of the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 9838**] - [**Hospital Unit Name 9839**].

   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: Podiatry saw and signed off. Likely mild
   cellulitis treated with broad spec abx. Needs out pt f/u
   - make outpt f/u apt
   .
   # FEN: Follow nutrition recommendations. Start tubefeeds, 250cc free
   water flushes q4h. Considering PEG placement. Replete lytes prn.
   # PPX: PPI IV BID for now assuming there are varices/gastritis, no

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of alcoholism. He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications, including respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated three times without improvement in mental status. He requires tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to inability to protect his airway. The patient also has cirrhosis of the liver, a history of intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy, and a shallow toe ulcer. His MELD score is 28.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever and hypoxemia, which could indicate a possible pneumonia. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and consider sending sputum cultures for identification of any bacterial infection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of ESLD and previous episodes of encephalopathy. He is currently experiencing altered mental status, which could be related to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose and rifaximin should be continued to manage this condition.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of mild disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and is currently on blood thinners. Close monitoring of coagulation factors and blood products is necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute on chronic liver disease, subdural hemorrhage, and hypoxemia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and has presented with multiple complications including pneumonia, enterobacter cloacae infection, hypernatremia, coagulopathy, and anemia. He also has a shallow toe ulcer and transverse process fractures. The patient's mental status is altered due to hypoxia and hepatic encephalopathy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has shown signs of worsening secretions and possible mucous plugging, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Enterobacter cloacae infection: The patient has grown enterobacter cloacae, which is pan-sensitive. However, there is inducible resistance, and the patient may no longer respond to therapy.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, indicating possible dehydration or excessive intake of sodium-containing fluids.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of mild DIC on admission. There is a concern for ongoing bleeding, and coagulation factors and blood products should be monitored and administered as necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, and further evaluation and management are needed."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis and recurrent aspiration, currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various medications and treatments.

From the note, it is mentioned that the patient had a fever this morning with a temperature of 101.3°F. The source of the fever remains unknown. The patient's respiratory status appears to be stable, and there are no new infiltrates observed on the chest X-ray. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, making ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) less likely.

The patient's mental status is altered, but not due to delirium. He has an inability to protect his airway, which poses a risk for aspiration. The patient also has cirrhosis of the liver, likely due to alcoholic causes.

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and there is suspicion of a subdural hemorrhage (SDH).

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/44 to 132/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's weight has increased from 80.8 kg at admission to 90.5 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1970 mL and output of"

   # Hypoxemia, fevers: Likely pneumonia.  Patient growing enterobacter
   cloacae which is pan-sensitive.  Continues to spike, however, despite
   broad coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis
   with metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today was in the context of
   worsening secretions; could have had mucous plugging.  In addition
   enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer
   responding to the therapy. s/p extubation on [**11-21**]. Pt has been
   intubated 3 times this hospitalization, without improvement in his
   mental status.   He will need trach/PEG placement, as at this point it
   is unlikely that his mental status will improve such that he will be
   able to protect his airway.
   - Surgery consulted, will place Trach tomorrow ([**12-2**]), and PEG also,
   if pt afebrile.
   - New fevers but unknown source. Sent bcx, ucx, sputum cx; cxr from

   # Dispo:  ICU pending improvement of respiratory status
","The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, subdural hematoma, altered mental status, and alcoholic cirrhosis. The patient's current conditions include fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure (not ARDS), subdural hematoma, and hypoxemia. 

The patient's recent events include being intubated three times without improvement in mental status. He has had a fall resulting in an intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy, and worsening secretions. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin levels, and abnormal coagulation profile. 

The patient's imaging studies reveal large bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, and mild engorgement of the azygos vein consistent with worsened fluid overload. 

The patient's assessment and plan include treating pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics, arranging for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to the likelihood of persistent altered mental status and inability to protect the airway. 

Other stable/non-active issues include managing hypernatremia, coagulopathy, head bleed secondary to a fall, altered mental status secondary to hypoxia and hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, ESLD, transverse process fractures, shallow toe ulcer, and feeding intolerance. 

The patient's allergies include citalopram and shakiness. The last dose of antibiotics was meropenem on 12/1/2156 at 02:00 AM. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax: 38.7°C or 101.6°F), heart rate (HR: 97 bpm), blood pressure (BP: 112/41 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR: 13 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation (SpO2: 94%). 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,455 mL and output of 1,965 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 17 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance of 50 mL/cmH2O. 

The patient's physical examination findings include no abnormality in the general, head/eyes/ears/nose, or cardiovascular systems, but there is forehead lac/hematoma without surrounding erythema/warmth, reduced breath sounds bilaterally with bibasilar crackles, soft abdomen with no jaundice or hepatomegaly, and 2+pitting edema bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.9 x 10^9/L, slightly elevated hematocrit (Hct) of 22.5%, normal platelet count (Plt) of 38 x 10^9/L, and abnormal coagulation profile with prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR). The patient's blood chemistry shows mild hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. 

The patient's microbiology results show growth of Enterobacter cloacae in urine culture, while other cultures remain negative. The patient's imaging studies reveal large bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, and mild engorgement of the azygos vein consistent with worsened fluid overload. 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis due to infection, worsening hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and further deterioration of the patient's overall condition."

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and encephalopathy; course
   complicated by intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy and
   current hypoxemia.
   .
   # Hypoxemia,: Likely pneumonia.  Patient growing enterobacter cloacae
   which is pan-sensitive.  Continues to spike, however, despite broad
   coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today was in the context of
   worsening secretions; could have had mucous plugging.  In addition
   enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer
   responding to the therapy. s/p extubation on [**11-21**]. Pt has been
   intubated 4 times this hospitalization, without significant improvement
   in his mental status.   He will need trach/PEG placement, as at this
   point it is unlikely that his mental status will improve such that he
   will be able to protect his airway.
   - Surgery consulted, will place Trach tomorrow ([**12-2**]), and PEG also,
   if pt afebrile. Will need 1U Plt and 4U FFP prior to surgery.
   - Continue Meropenem x14 day course, D1 = [**11-21**], d/c after [**12-6**]
   - If pt clinically declines, consider paracentesis for SBP
 however pt
   is being covered for SBP with meropenem.
   - Arrange trach placement
   - ID consult, follow up recs
   - Lasix prn as pt
s respiratory status and hypoxia improved with
   aggressive diuresis; but holding for now given pt
s hypernatremia.
   - Wean PEEP as tolerated.
   .
   # Fever: - New fevers but unknown source. Sent bcx, ucx, sputum cx; cxr
   from today does not show evidence of infiltrate; need to follow up
   cultures.  Will evaluate for non-infectious causes of fever while
   continuing to treat for VAP.
   - Will send C. diff.
   - Will obtain RUQ US to eval for cholecystitis
   - Will start empiric Vanco coverage
   - Will check lipase to eval for pancreatitis, as non-infectious cause
   of fever
   - Continue Meropenem x14 day course, D1 = [**11-21**], d/c after [**12-6**]
   - If pt clinically declines, consider paracentesis for SBP
 however pt
   is being covered for SBP with meropenem.
   - ID consult, follow up recs
   - If pt continues to spike, could consider dedicated CT sinus to eval
   for sinusitis.
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Monitoring Na closely. Urine lytes do not suggest DI.
    Suspect hypernatremia is due to pt not having tube feeds x 3 days,
   on-going tx with lactulose, and aggressive diuresis on the floor.
   - Continue free water flushes; will continue D5 given cont
   hypernatremia
   - check PM sodium
   .
   Stable/Non-active Issues:
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission. Now
   holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products given
   stable over several days.  Minimal bleeding with suctioning.  On [**11-23**]
   patient had 2 units PRBC transfused without appropriate increase in
   hct, but no clear source of bleeding. CT head, torso yesterday ([**11-24**])
   showed no source of bleeding.
   - daily coags, HCT
   - transfuse as necessary
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: Occurred on [**2156-11-11**] and in setting of liver
   disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes
   ([**11-13**] and [**11-16**]) and neuro exam stable as above.
   - cont dilantin for seizure ppx, follow levels; per neurosurgery, pt
   will need to continue on dilantin until his h/s f/u in 1 mo w. head CT
   - daily neurology exams, follow INR and CBC daily
   - fall precautions, low bed
   - f/u plastics recs
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hypoxia--Improving. Was
   secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy.
   The patient has known decompensated liver disease with a previous
   history of encephalopathy.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   .
   #. Anemia: Stable.
   - Daily HCTs, coags as above
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will monitor NGT output for bleeding
   .
   #. ESLD: No viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is 28 ([**11-29**]). In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per neurosurgery are non-operative.
   Does not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 363**] in 4 weeks with a non-contrast head CT.
   Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8464**] to schedule an appointment on the [**Location (un) 9850**] of the

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis and multiple falls. He is currently febrile with a temperature of 101.6°F. The patient is awaiting T+G (likely referring to liver function tests). He has been experiencing respiratory failure and has an altered mental status, but it is not delirium. The patient's airway is compromised, putting him at risk for aspiration. He has a history of alcohol abuse, which has led to cirrhosis of the liver. The source of his fever is unclear, and there are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile infection, and acalculous cholecystitis. The patient also has hypernatremia, likely due to decreased intake, the use of Lasix, and lactulose-induced osmotic diarrhea. He requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, he is at an increased risk for developing VAP. Regular cultures and antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
2. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient's use of antibiotics increases the risk for C. diff infection. Stool cultures and treatment with specific antibiotics may be required if infection is suspected.
3. Acalculous cholecystitis: The patient's fever and history of cirrhosis raise concerns for ac"

   .
   # Hypoxemia,: Likely pneumonia.  Patient growing enterobacter cloacae
   which is pan-sensitive.  Continues to spike, however, despite broad
   coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today was in the context of
   worsening secretions; could have had mucous plugging.  In addition
   enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer
   responding to the therapy. s/p extubation on [**11-21**]. Pt has been
   intubated 4 times this hospitalization, without significant improvement
   in his mental status.   He will need trach/PEG placement, as at this
   point it is unlikely that his mental status will improve such that he
   will be able to protect his airway.
   - Trach planned for this AM,  will give 1U Plts, 5U FFP, 1U pRBCs prior

   holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products given
   stable over several days.  Minimal bleeding with suctioning.  On [**11-23**]
   patient had 2 units PRBC transfused without appropriate increase in
   hct, but no clear source of bleeding. CT head, torso yesterday ([**11-24**])
   showed no source of bleeding.
   - daily coags, HCT
   - transfuse as necessary
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: Occurred on [**2156-11-11**] and in setting of liver
   disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes
   ([**11-13**] and [**11-16**]) and neuro exam stable as above.
   - Dilantin level too high, so will decr to 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Will check Dilantin level prior to 4^th dose on [**12-4**] AM
   - Cont dilantin for seizure ppx, follow levels; per neurosurgery, pt
   will need to continue on dilantin until his h/s f/u in 1 mo w. head CT
   - daily neurology exams, follow INR and CBC daily
   - fall precautions, low bed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hypoxia--Improving. Was
   secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy.
   The patient has known decompensated liver disease with a previous
   history of encephalopathy.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)

   - Daily HCTs, coags as above
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will monitor NGT output for bleeding
   .
   #. ESLD: No viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is 28 ([**11-29**]). In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs

   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per neurosurgery are non-operative.
   Does not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 363**] in 4 weeks with a non-contrast head CT.

   46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and encephalopathy; course
   complicated by intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy and
   current hypoxemia.
   .
   # Hypoxemia,: Likely pneumonia.  Patient growing enterobacter cloacae
   which is pan-sensitive.  Continues to spike, however, despite broad
   coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today was in the context of
   worsening secretions; could have had mucous plugging.  In addition
   enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer
   responding to the therapy. s/p extubation on [**11-21**]. Pt has been
   intubated 4 times this hospitalization, without significant improvement
   in his mental status.   He will need trach/PEG placement, as at this
   point it is unlikely that his mental status will improve such that he
   will be able to protect his airway.
   - Surgery consulted, will place Trach tomorrow ([**12-2**]), and PEG also,
   if pt afebrile. Will need 1U Plt and 4U FFP prior to surgery.
   - Continue Meropenem x14 day course, D1 = [**11-21**], d/c after [**12-6**]
   - If pt clinically declines, consider paracentesis for SBP
 however pt
   is being covered for SBP with meropenem.
   - Arrange trach placement
   - ID consult, follow up recs
   - Lasix prn as pt
s respiratory status and hypoxia improved with
   aggressive diuresis; but holding for now given pt
s hypernatremia.
   - Wean PEEP as tolerated.
   .
   # Fever: - New fevers but unknown source. Sent bcx, ucx, sputum cx; cxr
   from today does not show evidence of infiltrate; need to follow up
   cultures.  Will evaluate for non-infectious causes of fever while
   continuing to treat for VAP.
   - Will send C. diff.
   - Will obtain RUQ US to eval for cholecystitis
   - Will start empiric Vanco coverage
   - Will check lipase to eval for pancreatitis, as non-infectious cause
   of fever
   - Continue Meropenem x14 day course, D1 = [**11-21**], d/c after [**12-6**]
   - If pt clinically declines, consider paracentesis for SBP
 however pt
   is being covered for SBP with meropenem.
   - ID consult, follow up recs
   - If pt continues to spike, could consider dedicated CT sinus to eval
   for sinusitis.
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Monitoring Na closely. Urine lytes do not suggest
   DI.  Suspect hypernatremia is due to pt not having tube feeds x 3 days,
   on-going tx with lactulose, and aggressive diuresis on the floor.
   - Continue free water flushes; will continue D5 given cont
   hypernatremia
   - check PM sodium
   .
   Stable/Non-active Issues:
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission. Now
   holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products given
   stable over several days.  Minimal bleeding with suctioning.  On [**11-23**]
   patient had 2 units PRBC transfused without appropriate increase in
   hct, but no clear source of bleeding. CT head, torso yesterday ([**11-24**])
   showed no source of bleeding.
   - daily coags, HCT
   - transfuse as necessary
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: Occurred on [**2156-11-11**] and in setting of liver
   disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes
   ([**11-13**] and [**11-16**]) and neuro exam stable as above.
   - cont dilantin for seizure ppx, follow levels; per neurosurgery, pt
   will need to continue on dilantin until his h/s f/u in 1 mo w. head CT
   - daily neurology exams, follow INR and CBC daily
   - fall precautions, low bed
   - f/u plastics recs
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hypoxia--Improving. Was
   secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy.
   The patient has known decompensated liver disease with a previous
   history of encephalopathy.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   .
   #. Anemia: Stable.
   - Daily HCTs, coags as above
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will monitor NGT output for bleeding
   .
   #. ESLD: No viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is 28 ([**11-29**]). In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per neurosurgery are non-operative.
   Does not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) and multiple comorbidities. He is currently intubated in the ICU for respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of alcohol use disorder, intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy, and recent falls. He has been admitted multiple times and has had previous tracheostomy and PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) placements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure due to pneumonia or aspiration.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient has persistent hypoxemia despite being on high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation. This could be due to pneumonia, mucous plugging, or other underlying causes.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and altered mental status. There is a risk of delirium or worsening encephalopathy.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of liver dysfunction and coagulopathy. There is a risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.
6. Infection: The patient has grown enterobacter cloacae,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, multiple falls, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and recurrent aspiration. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and requires endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 112/48 to 142/65 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has been experiencing fevers since 12/1 and has undergone cultures of blood, urine, and sputum. The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia, altered mental status, risk for aspiration, cirrhosis of the liver, and subdural hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation put him at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Infection: The presence of fevers and positive blood cultures indicate an ongoing infection. The patient is at risk for sepsis and septic shock if the infection is not promptly identified and treated.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's history of ETOH cirrhosis suggests underlying liver dysfunction. This increases the risk of complications such as hepatic enceph"

   # Hypoxemia,: Likely pneumonia.  Patient growing enterobacter cloacae
   which is pan-sensitive.  Continues to spike, however, despite broad
   coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today was in the context of
   worsening secretions; could have had mucous plugging.  In addition
   enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer
   responding to the therapy. s/p extubation on [**11-21**]. Pt has been
   intubated 4 times this hospitalization, without significant improvement
   in his mental status.   He will need trach/PEG placement, as at this
   point it is unlikely that his mental status will improve such that he
   will be able to protect his airway.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple complications. The patient has a history of alcoholism and presents with signs of hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxemia, hypernatremia, pneumonia, subdural hemorrhage, and anemia. The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires aggressive management including tracheostomy placement, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) placement, and ongoing supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis, indicating possible respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABG analysis is essential.
2. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a growing concern of enterobacter cloacae infection. Frequent cultures, close monitoring of vital signs, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of mild DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) on admission. Regular coagulation factor monitoring, platelet counts, and appropriate transfusion as needed are required.
4. Head Bleed: The patient experienced a fall resulting in an intraparenchymal bleed. Close neurologic monitoring and imaging studies should be performed to assess for any changes or rebleeding.

   # Respiratory failure,: Likely pneumonia.  Patient growing enterobacter
   cloacae which is pan-sensitive.  Continues to spike, however, despite
   broad coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis
   with metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today was in the context of
   worsening secretions; could have had mucous plugging.  In addition
   enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer
   responding to the therapy. s/p extubation on [**11-21**]. Pt has been
   intubated 4 times this hospitalization, without significant improvement
   in his mental status.   He will need trach/PEG placement, as at this
   point it is unlikely that his mental status will improve such that he
   will be able to protect his airway.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of alcohol use disorder. He was admitted with respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia. The patient has undergone multiple intubations without significant improvement in mental status. He has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, altered mental status, fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, subdural hemorrhage, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition is complicated by recurrent infections, including enterobacter cloacae, and he has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of respiratory failure, which may be due to pneumonia or other underlying respiratory issues. Continuous monitoring and support are required to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with various infections, including pneumonia and enterobacter cloacae. It is important to closely monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagulopathy, which may be related to liver disease or other factors. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management with blood products and anticoagulants are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient initially presented with hypernatremia, but it has now resolved. However, close monitoring of electrolyte levels is still essential to prevent any imbalances or complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia, which is now complicated by an infection with enterobacter cloacae that is pan-sensitive. The patient has a history of falls, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol abuse, and liver cirrhosis. He also has coagulopathy, hypernatremia, shallow toe ulcer, and transverse process fractures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to worsening secretions and mucous plugging. There is a concern for pneumonia, and the patient may require tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection with enterobacter cloacae, which is pan-sensitive. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat the infection.

3. Liver Disease: The patient has decompensated liver disease with hepatic encephalopathy. Management includes lactulose and rifaximin therapy. The patient may need an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) to evaluate for varices, and a MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score of 28 indicates a high urgency for liver transplantation evaluation.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy secondary"

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD and a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, and a shallow toe ulcer. The patient has been intubated multiple times during this hospitalization without significant improvement in his mental status. He requires tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to his inability to protect his airway and feed himself.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has pneumonia, which is causing respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis as seen in the ABG results. Enterobacter cloacae, a hospital-acquired pathogen, has been identified in the sputum culture and is pan-sensitive to antibiotics. However, the patient's condition is not improving despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. This could be due to inducible resistance or ineffective therapy. The patient requires continued respiratory support, preferably through tracheostomy, and long-term antibiotic therapy.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels have now resolved. Free water flushes should be discontinued.

3. Fever: The patient has an unclear etiology for his fever. He is being treated for possible pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The source of the fever is still unknown, and it is possible that it is due to drug fever. The patient should continue on the current antibiotic regimen"

   Assessment and Plan
   46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and encephalopathy; course
   complicated by intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy and
   current hypoxemia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt initially had pneumonia and was growing
   enterobacter cloacae which is pan-sensitive.  He continued to spike,
   however, despite broad coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today
   was in the context of worsening secretions; could have had mucous
   plugging.  In addition enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps
   the patient is no longer responding to the therapy. s/p extubation on
   [**11-21**]. Pt has been intubated 4 times this hospitalization, without
   significant improvement in his mental status.   He will need trach/PEG
   placement, as at this point it is unlikely that his mental status will
   improve such that he will be able to protect his airway.
   - s/p trach placement on [**12-2**]
   - continue on trach collar
   - continue Meropenem x 14 day course, D1 = [**11-21**], d/c after [**12-6**]
   - Continue Vanc 1g q12h D1 = [**12-1**], will d/c on [**12-6**] as well; recheck
   vanc level this morning
   - f/u ID recs
   - diurese with Lasix 160 and spironolactone 200 today; goal >1L

   .
   # Fever: - Unclear etiology, however will treat for possible PNA, SBP.
   Likely due to drug fever. C diff neg. RUQ US neg for cholecystitis
   - Continue Meropenem x14 day course, D1 = [**11-21**], d/c after [**12-6**]
   - Continue Vanc 1g q12h D1 = [**12-1**], will d/c on [**12-6**] as well
   - f/u ID recs
   - hold off on CT sinuses to look for sinusitis, will complete course of
   abx as above
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Now resolved
   - Discontinue free water flushes
   .
   Stable/Non-active Issues:
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission. Now
   holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products given
   stable over several days.  Minimal bleeding with suctioning.  On [**11-23**]
   patient had 2 units PRBC transfused without appropriate increase in
   hct, but no clear source of bleeding. CT head, torso yesterday ([**11-24**])
   showed no source of bleeding.
   - daily coags, HCT
   - transfuse as necessary
   - 1 unit platelets this AM for plt drop 72 to 52
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: Occurred on [**2156-11-11**] and in setting of liver
   disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes
   ([**11-13**] and [**11-16**]) and neuro exam stable as above.
   - continue Dilantin 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - check tomorrow morning
s dilantin level
   - Cont dilantin for seizure ppx, follow levels; per neurosurgery, pt
   will need to continue on dilantin until his h/s f/u in 1 mo w. head CT
   - daily neurology exams, follow INR and CBC daily
   - fall precautions, low bed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hypoxia--Improving. Was
   secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy.
   The patient has known decompensated liver disease with a previous
   history of encephalopathy.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   .
   #. Anemia: Stable.
   - Daily Hcts, coags as above
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will monitor NGT output for bleeding
   .
   #. ESLD: No viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is 28 ([**11-29**]). In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - will likely need EGD for varices at some point
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per neurosurgery are non-operative.
   Does not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 363**] in 4 weeks with a non-contrast head CT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications and conditions that need attention. 

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had pneumonia and was growing enterobacter cloacae, which is pan-sensitive. Despite broad coverage with antibiotics, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate. The ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. The patient was intubated multiple times during this hospitalization without significant improvement in mental status. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement are recommended.

2. Fever: The patient has an ongoing fever of unknown etiology. It is unclear whether it is due to drug fever or possible pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Treatment for these conditions should be continued.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient had mild DIC on admission. Currently, the patient is holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products as they have been stable over several days. Minimal bleeding with suctioning has been observed.

4. Head bleed: The patient experienced a fall and suffered from a head bleed, likely related to liver disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes, and the neuro exam remains stable.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hypoxia and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver disease with a previous history of encephalopathy."

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has experienced multiple complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had pneumonia and was growing Enterobacter cloacae, which is a type of bacteria that is sensitive to antibiotics. However, the patient continued to spike fevers despite broad coverage with antibiotics. This suggests that there may be inducible resistance or the patient is not responding to therapy. The patient's ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. The patient has been intubated multiple times without significant improvement in mental status, indicating the need for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fever with an unclear etiology. Leading hypotheses include drug fever or infection. The patient's C. difficile test is negative, and a RUQ ultrasound did not show cholecystitis. Antibiotic coverage will be continued, and further investigations will be done to identify the source of infection.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient had elevated sodium levels but now they are resolved. Discontinuation of free water flushes was advised.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple complications. He has a history of alcohol abuse and has presented with ascites, varices, encephalopathy, intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, and hypoxemia. The patient has been intubated multiple times without significant improvement in mental status. He requires a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to his inability to protect his airway. The patient's current condition includes fever of unclear etiology, hypernatremia (now resolved), coagulopathy, head bleed, altered mental status, anemia, ESLD, transverse process fractures, shallow toe ulcer, and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical team is considering options for long-term acute care (LTAC) placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of pneumonia and current hypoxemia indicates a risk of respiratory failure. He has been intubated multiple times without significant improvement in mental status, suggesting potential complications related to airway management.
2. Infection: The patient's fever of unclear etiology may indicate an underlying infection. His immune system is compromised due to ESLD and prolonged hospitalization, making him susceptible to infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of intraparenchymal bleed and coagulopathy. His fragile"

   Assessment and Plan
   46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and encephalopathy; course
   complicated by intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy and
   current hypoxemia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt initially had pneumonia and was growing
   enterobacter cloacae which is pan-sensitive.  He continued to spike,
   however, despite broad coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident leading
   to last ICU transfer was in the context of worsening secretions; could
   have had mucous plugging.  In addition enterobacter has inducible
   resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer responding to the therapy.
   s/p extubation on [**11-21**]. Pt has been intubated 4 times this
   hospitalization, without significant improvement in his mental
   status.   He will need trach/PEG placement, as at this point it is
   unlikely that his mental status will improve such that he will be able
   to protect his airway.
   - s/p trach placement on [**12-2**]
   - continue on trach collar
   - continue Meropenem x 14 day course, D1 = [**11-21**], d/c after last dose
   today
   - Continue Vanc 1g q12h D1 = [**12-1**], d/c after last dose today
   - f/u ID recs
   - diurese with Lasix 160 and spironolactone 200 today; goal >1L
   negative today, PRN lasix bolus with acetazolamide pending VBG results.
   (concern for alkalosis given jump in bicarb today)
   .
   # Fever: - Unclear etiology, however will complete ABX as above.
   Leading hypothesis had been drug fever. C diff neg. RUQ US neg for
   cholecystitis
   - Continue Meropenem x14 day course, D1 = [**11-21**], d/c today as above
   - Continue Vanc 1g q12h D1 = [**12-1**], will d/c today as above
   - f/u ID recs
   - hold off on CT sinuses to look for sinusitis, will complete course of
   abx as above
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Now resolved
   - Discontinue free water flushes
   .
   Stable/Non-active Issues:
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission. Now
   holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products given
   stable over several days.  Minimal bleeding with suctioning.  On [**11-23**]
   patient had 2 units PRBC transfused without appropriate increase in
   hct, but no clear source of bleeding. CT head, torso yesterday ([**11-24**])
   showed no source of bleeding.
   - daily coags, HCT
   - transfuse as necessary
   - 1 unit platelets this AM for plt drop 72 to 52
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: Occurred on [**2156-11-11**] and in setting of liver
   disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes
   ([**11-13**] and [**11-16**]) and neuro exam stable as above.
   - continue Dilantin 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Cont dilantin for seizure ppx, follow levels; per neurosurgery, pt
   will need to continue on dilantin until his h/s f/u in 1 mo w. head CT
   - daily neurology exams, follow INR and CBC daily
   - fall precautions, low bed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to intraparenchymal
   hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known
   decompensated liver disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   .
   #. Anemia: Stable.
   - Daily Hcts, coags as above
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   #. ESLD: No viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is 28 ([**11-29**]). In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - will likely need EGD for varices at some point
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per neurosurgery are non-operative.
   Does not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 363**] in 4 weeks with a non-contrast head CT.
   Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8464**] to schedule an appointment on the [**Location (un) 9850**] of the

   .
   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: Podiatry saw and signed off. Likely mild
   cellulitis treated with broad spec abx.
   - needs out pt f/u
   .
   # FEN: On tubefeeds. Replete lytes prn.  Will need PEG placement at
   some point (holding while febrile and coagulopathic).

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and associated complications. He has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with multiple comorbidities, including ascites, varices, encephalopathy, pneumonia, and intraparenchymal bleed. The patient has been intubated multiple times without significant improvement in mental status and requires tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible mucous plugging, fever of unknown etiology, hypernatremia that is now resolved, coagulopathy, head bleed from a fall in the setting of liver disease-related coagulopathy, altered mental status likely secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, ESLD with a MELD score of 28, transverse process fractures, shallow toe ulcer, and feeding tube placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure due to recurrent pneumonia and mucous plugging.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections, especially since he is immunocompromised and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Bleeding: Despite the improvement in coagulation parameters, the patient's history of liver disease-related coagulopathy puts him at risk for bleeding, especially"

   # Respiratory failure: Pt initially had pneumonia and was growing
   enterobacter cloacae which is pan-sensitive.  He continued to spike,
   however, despite broad coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident leading
   to last ICU transfer was in the context of worsening secretions; could
   have had mucous plugging.  In addition enterobacter has inducible
   resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer responding to the therapy.
   s/p extubation on [**11-21**]. Pt has been intubated 4 times this
   hospitalization, without significant improvement in his mental
   status.   He will need trach/PEG placement, as at this point it is
   unlikely that his mental status will improve such that he will be able
   to protect his airway.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple complications. The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had pneumonia and is growing Enterobacter cloacae, which is pan-sensitive. Despite broad coverage with antibiotics, the patient continues to spike, indicating a possible development of inducible resistance or ineffective therapy. The ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. This suggests ongoing respiratory compromise, and the patient may require more aggressive respiratory support or intervention.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of liver disease-related coagulopathy and has experienced bleeding episodes. There is a need for careful monitoring of coagulation parameters, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent further bleeding.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a history of hypernatremia, which has now resolved. However, it is important to monitor electrolyte levels closely to prevent its recurrence.

4. Head bleed: The patient had a fall leading to a head bleed, which was likely due to liver disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes, and the neuro exam remains stable. Continuous monitoring of neurological status and coagulation parameters is necessary.

5. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status likely secondary to hypoxia, improving over time. It is important to optimize oxygenation and"

   Disposition:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of ethanol abuse. He has had a complicated hospital course due to a fall that resulted in a parafalcine subdural hematoma (SDH) and right intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). The patient's 24-hour events include the use of Lasix IV, evaluation for tracheostomy, restart of tube feeds, and the discontinuation of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet count and coagulation parameters is necessary to prevent or manage bleeding complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of ESLD and recent discontinuation of antibiotics may increase the risk of pneumonia. Regular respiratory assessment and appropriate infection control measures should be implemented.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to multiple factors such as liver disease, brain injuries (SDH and IPH), or infections. Close neurologic monitoring and further investigation into the underlying cause are required.
4. Airway Protection: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway and risk of aspiration, appropriate measures like tracheostomy and careful positioning should be taken to ensure adequate respiratory function.
5. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of ethanol abuse. He has been admitted to the ICU due to complications from a fall, resulting in a parafalcine subdural hematoma (SDH) and right intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). The patient has had a prolonged hospital course with various issues including trauma, IP bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy, and recurrent respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and Dobhoff placement.

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, likely a combination of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Enterobacter, mucus plugging, poor mental status, and volume overload. He has been treated with antibiotics for VAP, which he completed a 14-day course. Diuretics have been initiated to manage fluid overload, and acetazolamide has been given to correct elevated bicarbonate levels.

The patient also has fever of unknown etiology, which may be drug-related. His hypernatremia has resolved, and coagulopathy is being monitored with daily coagulation studies and Hct. The patient is on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis due to his head injury and liver disease. Lactulose and rifaximin have been continued for hepatic encephalopathy. Anemia is stable, and ESLD is being managed with lact"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has a history of alcohol abuse. He is currently in the ICU due to a complicated hospital course caused by a fall resulting in a parafalcine subdural hematoma and right intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient has had multiple medical issues including respiratory failure, pneumonia, encephalopathy, and recurrent respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and Dobhoff placement.

24-hour events include the administration of Lasix IV, bicarbonate elevation, restart of tube feeds, evaluation for passy-muir valve, and discontinuation of vancomycin and meropenem. The patient's temperature is elevated, and blood cultures have been sent.

Vital signs show a fever, stable blood pressure, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight has increased from admission. Fluid balance shows an output of 2,900 mL with an input of 1,478 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,422 mL.

Physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds in the lung fields, coughing up bloody secretions from the tracheostomy, distended abdomen, severe jaundice, and diffuse swelling in the lower extremities.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, liver enzymes, and total bilir"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of alcohol abuse. He has had a complicated hospital course due to a fall resulting in parafalcine subdural hematoma (SDH) and right intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fever, diuresis, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and ESLD. He has also sustained transverse process fractures and a shallow toe ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Enterobacter, mucus plugging, poor mental status, and volume overload. Despite tracheostomy placement and completing a 14-day course of antibiotics for VAP, the patient still has substantial airway secretions.
2. Fever: The patient continues to have daily spikes in temperature, despite completing a 14-day course of antibiotics for VAP. There is no clear source of infection, and blood cultures are pending. The possibility of drug-induced fever should be considered.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy likely secondary to hepatic dysfunction. Platelets are low, and there is oozing from the tracheostomy site. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelet transfusions have been administered to correct coagulopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of alcohol abuse. He has been hospitalized with a complicated course due to a fall resulting in a parafalcine subdural hematoma and right intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). The patient's medical conditions include ascites, varices, encephalopathy, trauma with IP bleed, pneumonia, recurrent respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and Dobhoff placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to mucus plugging, poor mental status, volume overload, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Fever: The patient has daily spikes in temperature, despite completing a 14-day course of antibiotics for VAP. There is a concern for drug-induced fever or another underlying infection.
3. Intracranial Hypertension: The patient has a right IPH and parafalcine SDH, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure. Monitoring of neurological exams and daily CBC and coags is necessary.
4. Seizure Prophylaxis: The patient requires seizure prophylaxis due to the intracranial hemorrhage. Dilantin dosing should be adjusted to maintain therapeutic levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and a history of ETOH (ethanol) abuse. He has been admitted to the ICU with a complicated hospital course due to a fall resulting in a parafalcine subdural hematoma (SDH) and right intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). The patient has had multiple medical issues, including respiratory failure, fever, intracranial hemorrhage, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and ESLD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to a combination of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Enterobacter, mucus plugging, poor mental status, and volume overload. Tracheostomy placement has been performed.
2. Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation: The patient has a right IPH and parafalcine SDH, which can lead to increased ICP. Monitoring and management of ICP are essential.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and timely reversal with platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are necessary.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to intraparenchymal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy. Management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of ethanol abuse. He has had a complicated hospital course due to a fall resulting in a parafalcine subdural hematoma and right intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). The patient has experienced multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, fever, intracranial hemorrhage, coagulopathy, altered mental status, ESLD, and transverse process fractures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable despite tracheostomy placement. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to mucus plugging, poor mental status, and volume overload.
2. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, and the source of infection is unclear. It is important to monitor the fever curve and wait for the results of blood and urine cultures.
3. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient has a right IPH and parafalcine SDH. Close monitoring of neurological exams, serial imaging, and dilantin levels are necessary for seizure prophylaxis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Monitoring of platelet counts and INR levels is crucial. Platelet transfusion and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be required for reversal of coagulopathy.
5. Altered mental status:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current health status, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient has a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and prolonged clotting times (PTT/INR), indicating a potential bleeding risk.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and respiratory symptoms suggest the possibility of pneumonia, especially given the recent bronchoscopy and tracheostomy evaluation.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing confusion and altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as infection, medication side effects, or other underlying conditions.

4. Airway compromise: The patient has an inability to protect their own airway, putting them at risk for aspiration and impaired gas exchange.

5. Liver cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic liver disease, which may contribute to their current health issues.

6. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has had persistent fever without a known source, indicating the need for further investigation.

7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, potentially due to factors such as pneumonia, airway issues, or other underlying lung problems.

8. Subdural hemorrhage: The patient has a history of subdural hemorrhage, which can cause neurological symptoms and contribute to their altered mental status.

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor and"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of ethanol abuse. He has had a complicated hospital course following a fall that resulted in a parafalcine subdural hematoma (SDH) and right intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 134/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on tracheal mask ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 48 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 114 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 159 mg/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 52. The coagulation profile reveals prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) at 25.7/50.7/2.5, respectively. Liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are slightly elevated at 25/53, while other liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 134/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on tracheal mask ventilation. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, high creatinine level, and abnormal blood gas values. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of mental status changes, mucus plugging, and volume overload. The large left pleural effusion with nearly absent aeration of the left lung suggests compression and plugging.

2. Infection: The patient has had multiple fever spikes without a clear source of infection. The collapsed left lung and chronic aspiration of bloody secretions are significant contributors to this. Cultures for blood, urine, and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple comorbidities. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to aspiration of bloody secretions and a large left pleural effusion. There is also a mention of fever spikes overnight without a clear source of infection. Additionally, the patient has intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with right intraparenchymal hemorrhage and parafalcine subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient is currently on ventilatory support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and aspiration of bloody secretions increase the risk of developing pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: With fever spikes and the presence of potential sources of infection such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, and tracheal bleeding, there is a risk of sepsis developing.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's ESLD, there is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a falling platelet count and rising INR, indicating coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and other risk factors increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 48M ESLD, falls c/b ICH now s/p trach. Course
   c/b lingular bleed and ongoing trach ooze in the setting
   of coagulopathy / thrombocytopenia.  Was bronched by
   IP bronch yesterday w/ sig bleeding post-procedure.  Transfused plt
   and ffp with improvement.  Briefly on vent, then transitioned back
   to TC.
   Exam notable for Tm 100.6  BP 100-160 sys HR 70-100  RR 13  sat 96% on
   TM 50% . Thin M, icteric, eyes open spontaneously, not able to
   follow commands or interact. coarse BS b. RRR s1s2. Distended, +BS
   soft, 2+ dep/scrotal edema.
   Labs notable for WBC 4K, HCT 23, PLTs 54, INR 2.2, K+ 3.8, Cr 0.7.
   CXR: multifocal opacities, increased opacification of LUL,  b
   effusions.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure / volume overload with
   continued diuresis with lasix, diamox, following urine outpt and
   lytes. Airway/lingular bleeding and probable aspiration of blood
   further contributing to worsening cxr appearance. He continues to have
   low grade temps, but his fio2 requirements have not changed
   significantly and he remains w/o leukocytosis, having recently
   completed antbx course for HAP/VAP on [**12-6**].  Will resend sputum,
   pan cxs, stool for c diff and differential holding on additional antbx
   at this time unless clinical decline.  Will us abd and perform dx para
   to eval possible SBP source, thouhg likely yeild given antbx.  Have
   considered possible therapeutic /dx [**Female First Name (un) 231**]. This would requrie
   significant reversal of coagulopathy which has been difficult in this
   pt.  As fever curve is down and there is no leukocytosis, would hold
   for now, noting that we suspect effusions are related to volume ol.
   His ICH / neuro status remains stable, and we continue dilantin. His
   encephalopathy is multifactorial, we continue lactulose and supportive
   care.  His hypernatremia is trending down with FW repletion. Remainder
   of plan as outlined above.  Continue to update family. ICU: Boots, PPI.
   Full code.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 40 min
   Addendum:  no obvious fluid seen on bedside us to safely perform dx
   para,  Will hold on this.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has a history of trauma with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), pneumonia, encephalopathy, and recurrent bouts of respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, respiratory distress, and altered mental status. He is on invasive ventilation and has undergone a bronchoscopy, which showed secretions and a bleed in the lingula that was treated with epinephrine. The patient continues to have copious secretions and has a fever, indicating possible pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The combination of mental status changes, mucus plugging, and volume overload may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's fever spikes overnight, suggesting a potential infection. Further investigations are needed to identify the source, including blood, urine, and sputum cultures.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to diuresis. Monitoring sodium levels and providing free water flushes are recommended.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, possibly related to hepatic dysfunction. Close monitoring of clotting factors and platelet count is necessary.
5. ICH: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to the intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Monitoring neurological exams and imaging is essential"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient underwent an invasive ventilation procedure and bronchoscopy, which revealed secretions in the lingula and left lower lobe (LLL), and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. The patient experienced bleeding after the bronchoscopy and received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 1 unit of platelets. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/57 mmHg to 161/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has a slight body tremor, is not tracking, and is unresponsive to pain. Physical examination reveals bronzed skin, coarse breath sounds throughout the lungs, and 2+ pitting edema in the thighs. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct), and prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR). The patient has hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the ICU due to multiple complications. The patient's medical history includes trauma with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), pneumonia, encephalopathy, and recurrent bouts of respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fever, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), coagulopathy, altered mental status, and ESLD. The patient is on invasive ventilation, and a bronchoscopy was performed, revealing no active bleeding but secretions in the lingula and left lower lobe (LLL). The patient experienced bleeding after the bronchoscopy and received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 1 unit of platelets.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/57 to 161/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has severe jaundice, coarse breath sounds throughout with decreased airflow on the left side, and actively stooling abdomen with 2+ pitting edema in both upper and lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia (sodium level of 129 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (potassium level of 5.3 K/uL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 48), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 25/53), elevated bilirubin levels (total bilirubin of 14.8 mg/dL and direct bilirubin of 4.1 mg/dL), and elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure due to a combination of mental status changes, mucus plugging, volume overload, oozing tracheostomy, and likely continuous aspiration of bloody secretions. There is also a large left pleural effusion with nearly absent aeration of the left lung, likely representing compression and plugging.

The patient is on diuretics (Lasix 80 IV boluses and acetazolamide 500 IV TID) for diuresis and volume management. An IP bronchoscopy is planned to evaluate the bleeding tracheostomy, and a post-bronchoscopy chest X-ray will be assessed.

The patient's fever spikes overnight without a clear source of infection, but collapsed left lung and chronic aspiration of bloody secretions are contributing factors. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures, as well as a c.diff toxin assay, will be followed up. Bedside ultrasonography (US) is planned to evaluate for ascites, considering the possibility of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient has a history of right intracranial hemorrhage (IPH) and parafalcine subdural hemorrhage (SDH) after multiple trauma, which is stable on serial imaging. Dilantin dosing is targeted at 15-20 with the current corrected level at 19.1. Monitoring includes daily neurological exams, daily complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation tests, fall precautions, and seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin.

The patient's coagulopathy is likely related to hepatic dysfunction, with falling platelets and rising INR. Reversal for possible thoracentesis involves transfusing 1 unit of platelets to achieve a goal of >50,000 and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with a goal INR of 2.0.

Altered mental status is likely due to intracranial hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose and rifaximin are prescribed for hepatic encephalopathy management.

The patient's transverse process fractures are managed non-operatively with a cervical collar or log rolling precautions. The patient has a power PICC line in place, and the next of kin is the patient's mother, who can"

   # Respiratory failure: combination mental status, mucus plugging and
   volume overload. Bronch yesterday showed secretions, bleed in lingual
   with BAL, treated with epinephrine with no further episodes of bleeding
   o/n, however pt continues to have copious secretions.  CXR today shows
   worsening effusions bilaterally, however pt clinically stable with no
   increased O2 requirement.  Recurrence of fever is somewhat concerning
   for PNA, however WBC stable and pt is clinically stable at this time.
   Given that recent abx course was completed for [**Last Name (LF) 6601**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold on
   further abx for now, proceed with diuresis, and consider restarting abx
   if pt shows any clinical deterioration.
   - hold on thoracentesis for now given that pt is high bleed risk,
   although pt may need [**Female First Name (un) 231**] in the future given persistent fevers to r/o
   empyema; effusions are most likely volume overload, and not infectious,
   given bilaterality, lack of leukocytosis or inceased O2 requirement.
   - hold on antibiotics for now as above
   - Lasix 80 IV BID for goal -2L today
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - aggressive pulmonary toilet

   # Dispo: ICU for now
","The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who presents with respiratory failure, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), altered mental status, and hypernatremia. The patient has a history of trauma, aspiration pneumonia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and altered mental status. Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk for VAP.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever spikes overnight without a clear source of infection, indicating a possible systemic inflammatory response. Additionally, the patient has positive blood cultures, suggesting a potential bacterial infection.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is immobilized and has a history of recent trauma, which increases the risk for DVT. Lower extremity Doppler ultrasounds should be performed to evaluate for DVT.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has ESLD and altered mental status, which may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment should include lactulose and rifaximin.

5. Pleural effusion: The patient has worsening"

   # Respiratory failure: combination mental status, mucus plugging and
   volume overload. Bronch yesterday showed secretions, bleed in lingual
   with BAL, treated with epinephrine with no further episodes of bleeding
   o/n, however pt continues to have copious secretions.  CXR today shows
   worsening consolidations bilaterally, however pt clinically stable with
   no increased O2 requirement.  New fever is somewhat concerning for PNA,
   however WBC stable and pt is clinically stable at this time.  Given
   that recent abx course was completed for [**Last Name (LF) 6601**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold on further abx
   for now, proceed with diuresis, and consider restarting abx if pt shows
   any clinical deterioration.
   - Lasix 80 IV for goal -2L, hold acetazolamide for now
   - no further bronch given pt is clinically stable
   - hold on thoracentesis for now given that pt is high bleed risk
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - aggressive pulmonary toilet

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple comorbidities, including ascites, varices, encephalopathy, pneumonia, intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), subdural hematoma (SDH), and prolonged hospital course with recurrent bouts of respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to a combination of mental status changes, mucus plugging, and volume overload. The patient also has fever spikes overnight without a clear source of infection, likely due to collapsed left lung and chronic aspiration of bloody secretions.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating possible infection. The patient has hypernatremia, coagulopathy, altered mental status, ESLD, and transverse process fractures. The patient's potassium levels are low, and there is concern for potential complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and infection of ascitic or pleural fluid.

The patient's current treatment plan includes diuresis, aggressive pulmonary toilet, monitoring for infection, and seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin. The patient's next of kin has been identified as the patient's mother, who will be contacted for consents and updates.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening respiratory failure due to continued mucus plugging and volume overload, development of"

The patient's medical history includes trauma with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), pneumonia, encephalopathy, and recurrent bouts of respiratory failure. He has also had an intra-abdominal bleed, subdural hematoma, and ascites.

Current Issues:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing mental status changes, mucus plugging, and volume overload, leading to recurrent episodes of respiratory failure. He has a tracheostomy and Dobhoff tube in place.
2. Fever: The patient has had a fever spike overnight without a clear source of infection. Antibiotics have been withheld due to recent abx course.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has worsening bilateral pleural effusions, but he is clinically stable with no increased oxygen requirement.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to diuresis and diarrhea from lactulose.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy likely secondary to hepatic dysfunction.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status likely due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy.
7. ESLD: The patient has ESLD with a possible diagnosis of hemochromatosis.
8. Transverse Process Fractures"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes trauma with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), pneumonia, and encephalopathy. He has been experiencing recurrent bouts of respiratory failure, requiring intubation and tracheostomy. The patient also has ascites, varices, and encephalopathy. His current condition includes fever, bronchospasm, and pleural effusions. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is receiving multiple medications, including diuretics, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent bouts of respiratory failure and bronchospasm indicate a potential risk for further respiratory compromise. Close monitoring and aggressive pulmonary toilet are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient's fever and pleural effusions raise concerns for a possible infection, such as pneumonia or empyema. It is important to monitor the patient's temperature curve and repeat chest X-rays to evaluate for any worsening of the effusions or development of new infiltrates.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile indicates a potential risk for bleeding complications. Regular monitoring of the patient's hematocrit, platelet count, and INR is crucial to assess bleeding risks and adjust anticoagulant therapy accordingly.

   # Dispo: ICU for now
","The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the ICU due to multiple complications including ascites, varices, encephalopathy, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been unstable with recurrent episodes of respiratory failure, mental status changes, fever, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, and altered mental status.

The patient's recent medical history includes a prolonged hospital course due to trauma with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), subdural hematoma (SDH), and pneumonia. The patient also has a history of alcohol abuse.

On the current admission, the patient presented with fever, coughing up brownish-colored secretions through the tracheostomy tube, and low oxygen saturation. The preliminary chest X-ray showed almost complete collapse of the left lung due to pleural effusions, and the right lower lobe (RLL) was also collapsed. There was no evidence of empyema. The patient's diuresis was positive, indicating fluid overload, and Lasix was given to address this.

The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C), heart rate in the high 80s, blood pressure in the 130s/70s, and respiratory rate around 16 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 97% on high-flow nasal cannula.

During the night, the patient's fever spiked"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 48M ESLD, falls c/b ICH now s/p trach. Course
   c/b bleeding at trach site, lingular bleed in the setting
   of coagulopathy / thrombocytopenia.  He remains febrile. Received lasix
    80 IV X 2 with good u/o response. Oozing from trach overnight, now
   with profuse bleeding.  IP en route.
   Exam notable for Tm 102.8-->100.9  BP 120/60 HR 90-110  RR 20  sat
   90-95% on TM 100% . Thin M, icteric, unable to follow commands or
   interact. large amt [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from trach, coarse BS, decreased b. RRR
   s1s2, distended, +BS soft, 2+ dep/scrotal edema.
   Labs: WBC 5.5, HCT 21.2,  PLTs  35, INR 2.5, K+ 3.7, Cr 0.9, na 141,
   alb 3.1, esr 16/crp p
   CXR: near complete opacification L, large effussions b, tracheal shift
   to r
   CT torso showed sig pleural effusions L > R, near complete L collapse,
   no obvious loculations or abscess seen.
   A/P: Pt now with diffuse bleeding from trachea.  IP with plans to
   bronch but will likely require OR for rigid bronch,/ bronchial blocker
   to stabilize bleeding. Aspiration of blood R lung continues in pt with
   little underlying reserve. Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia remains
   difficult to correct in this critically ill pt with ESLD.  Agree with
   plan to replace on vent for support/bronch, transfuse FFP, plts, cryo.
   Unlikely to be DIC, suspect all is liver ds
talk to heme about amicar,
   checking factor 8 level and fibrinogen.  Remains HD stable at this
   time, but consider placing triple lumen for improved access given
   significant bleeding.  Will urgently contact pts family to update them.
   Other active issues remains--Volume overload, but will hold on
   diureses pending bleeding stabilization.   Fevers, w/o
   leukocytosis, with no clear infection source ID'd. Cxs have been
   unrevealing. Potential sources include SBP, sinusitis (without oral
   secretions, + DHT), pleural fluid, blood clot, skin, picc line (no pos
   bl cx), or central fevers from ICH.  Suspect ongoing blood reabsorption
   and inflammation as etiology.  Have discussed possible therapeutic /dx
   [**Female First Name (un) 231**]. This would require reversal of coagulopathy which has been very
   difficult to achieve.  At this point too unstable to tolerate any such
   procedure.  Prognosis for recovery remains poor.  Will contact ethics
   and legal service to assist regarding goals of care as pt has no HCP,
   noting pts living will.  Remainder of plan as outlined above.  ICU:
   Boots, PPI. Full code. Picc
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 60 min
   Addendum:
   Ethics ([**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]) input appreciated.  I spoke with pt
s mother
   [**Name (NI) 1515**] and updated her to declining status, ongoing profuse bleeding and
   our limitations at reversing this process.  She understands that pt has
   very poor prognosis for recovery and is not a liver transplant
   candidate. Although OR for rigid bronch is a possibility, ongoing
   coagulopathy and transfusion dependance will most likely remain a [**Last Name 2050**]
   problem.  Family at this point wishes to change focus of  care toward
   aggressive comfort.  Will d/c blood draws, vent support, transfusions
   and move toward CMO.

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has experienced multiple complications during his hospital stay. The patient's condition has been unstable, with ongoing bleeding from the tracheostomy site, fever, pleural effusions, and respiratory failure. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 35), elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 2.5, hypoalbuminemia (albumin level of 3.1 g/dL), and hypernatremia (sodium level of 141 mEq/L).

The patient's imaging studies reveal near complete opacification of the left lung field, large pleural effusions bilaterally, and a tracheal shift to the right. The CT torso shows significant pleural effusions with no obvious loculations or abscess seen.

The patient's current plan includes replacing him on mechanical ventilation for respiratory support, urgent bronchoscopy to control the bleeding, and transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, and packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient's family has expressed a desire to shift the focus of care towards comfort measures only (CMO) due to the patient's poor prognosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and a history of trauma, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and multiple infections. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to respiratory failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, and coagulopathy. The patient's current condition includes ascites, varices, encephalopathy, bronchial secretions with bleeding, fever, hypoventilation, hypoxia, and altered mental status. He has undergone tracheostomy and Dobhoff placement. His vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/40 mmHg to 138/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 86%. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal a large right-sided pleural effusion and complete whiteout of the left lung.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent bouts of respiratory failure and current hypoventilation and hypoxia indicate a high risk of further respiratory compromise.
2. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient has experienced pulmonary hemorrhage, which can lead to continued bleeding and respiratory distress.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile suggests a bleeding tendency, which can contribute to hemorrhagic complications.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who has a history of ascites, varices, encephalopathy, trauma with intracranial hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, pneumonia, and recurrent respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, doffing (feeding tube), and bronchoscopy.

The patient's recent events include coughing up blood from the tracheostomy site, leading to a pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient was given epinephrine to reduce bleeding until further treatment could be administered. Despite this, the patient continues to experience recurrent bleeding, and a consultation with interventional pulmonology (IP) has been requested for repeat bronchoscopy and hemostasis.

The patient's fever spikes overnight without a clear source of infection, and cultures have been negative since November 20th. Antibiotics have been withheld due to recent completion of an antibiotic course. The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to hepatic dysfunction, and ongoing monitoring of HCT/platelets/INR is recommended.

The patient's altered mental status is likely attributed to intraparenchymal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment for encephalopathy includes lactulose and rifaximin. The patient's ESLD is secondary to alcohol use and negative viral serologies. There is also a"
