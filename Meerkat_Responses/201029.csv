","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of breast cancer that has metastasized to the bone and liver. She presents with dysphagia and hypotension. 

The patient's current assessment includes several potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: This may be due to dehydration, hypercalcemia, diuretic use, high BUN/Cr ratio, and hyponatremia. The patient has received IV fluids and her blood pressure has stabilized.
2. Altered mental status: This could be caused by dilaudid use and hepatic encephalopathy. Other less likely causes include hypoperfusion, infection, hypercalcemia, or brain metastases.
3. Dysphagia: The patient is immunocompromised and has oral thrush, which suggests esophageal candidiasis. Viral esophagitis (CMV, HSV) is also a possibility. The patient has been started on fluconazole for candidal esophagitis.
4. Hypercalcemia: This is a recurrent problem for the patient with widespread cancer. Her corrected calcium level is mildly elevated at 11.6.
5. Liver failure: The patient has known extensive liver metastases and no evidence of biliary obstruction on ultrasound.

The patient is currently receiving aggressive treatment for these conditions, including IV fluids, antibiotics, antifungals, and adjustments to her pain medication regimen. Further tests and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver. She presented with dysphagia and hypotension, which is likely due to dehydration, diuretic use, high BUN/creatinine ratio, and hyponatremia. The patient is also immunocompromised, making infection/sepsis a concern. She has been given IV fluids and her blood pressure is stable. The patient's altered mental status is likely from dilaudid use and hepatic encephalopathy. Other conditions include candidal esophagitis, liver failure, elevated coagulation parameters, hypercalcemia, and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates potential hypotension. Further fluid resuscitation may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Infection/Sepsis: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, there is a concern for infection or sepsis. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been started empirically. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is crucial.
3. Candidal Esophagitis: The presence of white plaques in the oropharynx and dysphagia suggests candidal esophagitis. Fluconazole has been prescribed, but if there is no improvement, a gastrointestinal scope may be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer who has extensive metastatic
   disease with substantial liver involvement and compromised hepatic
   function who has come in with significant hypotension in the setting of
   dilaudid Rx for significant pain from esophagitis and mucositis
   presumed.  This, in the setting of significant compromise of hepatic
   function may well have contributed to persistent and significant
   altered mental status acros time.  Mental status has improved as
   dilaudid had been metabolized.  The hyptension has persisted and is
   within the range of where patient has been documented to be recently at
   home.  This is with improved mental status this morning.  She has
   persistent hypotension through to this morning but without obvious
   source for acute worsening of stability.  Investigation of the primary
   issue would suggest--preload has been repleted, sources of vasodilatory
   insult including adrenal failure, hypthyroidism and sepsis appear less
   likely.  We have the persistent and resting tacycardia likely
   represents cardiac compromise and does raise concern for possible
   compromise SV.  The issue may be patient with continued loss of
   intravascular volume.
   1)Hypotension-
   -Will have to evaluate ECHO today
   -Will have to fluid bolus as needed
   -Will need to finalize any culture results in regards to bacterial
   infection but do not have clear evidcence of it.
   -If ECHO reassuring will need to consider
intravascular volume
   depletion + effects of narcotics as most likely cause for hypotension
   and manage appropriately going forward
   2)Altered Mental Status-Much improved today with patient alert,

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer and extensive metastatic disease, including liver involvement. She has been admitted to the ICU for significant hypotension and altered mental status. The patient has been receiving Dilaudid for pain management, which may have contributed to her altered mental status. Her hypotension persists despite improvement in mental status, and no obvious source for acute worsening has been identified. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to cardiac compromise and may indicate possible compromise of stroke volume. There is concern for possible intravascular volume depletion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires evaluation of an echocardiogram (ECHO) to assess cardiac function. Fluid bolus administration may be necessary to manage hypotension. The results of any bacterial infection cultures should also be considered. If the ECHO is reassuring, intravascular volume depletion and the effects of narcotics should be considered as potential causes for hypotension.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved significantly, but careful use of narcotics and the administration of lactulose should continue to be considered.
3. Mucositis: Local therapy for control of mucositis and the use of narcotics on a PRN basis should be managed.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to the potential for ARF"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastasis to the bone and liver. She presented with dysphagia and hypotension. She is immunocompromised due to chemotherapy and steroids. The patient has hepatic failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. She also has candidal esophagitis, which is being treated with fluconazole. CMV infection has been confirmed, and she is receiving ganciclovir therapy. There is a possibility of infection/sepsis, but blood cultures have been negative. The patient's mental status may be due to dilaudid use and hepatic encephalopathy. Pain management is a concern, and she is on various medications for this. The patient's liver function tests and total bilirubin are elevated, indicating liver failure. There are multiple focal hepatic hypodensities compatible with known metastatic disease to the liver. Moderate right hydronephrosis and moderate ascites are also present. The patient has a history of cancer, hypotension, and altered mental status.

1. Infection/sepsis: The patient is immunocompromised, and although blood cultures have been negative so far, there is still a possibility of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and repeating cultures may be necessary.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may contribute to altered mental status"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit.  MAPS now high 70s.
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for MAP<60, although patient is likely
   third spacing IVF with such a low albumin.  Now on albumin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - consider d/c Vanc/Zosyn as CMV positive.
   - Tripped home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this
   - Hold diuresis for now
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain metastases.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose seems to have cleared MS some
   - Will get CT head to evaluate for metastatic disease, as could  be
   causing altered mental status
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, consider
   CTA chest to r/o PE.
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.   Now CMV positive.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days.  Consider d/c since now on treatment with Gangcylovir
   -Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be
   caused by CMV.
   -hold diuretics for now
   -aggressive nutrition
   -lactulose
   # Hct drop: likely dilutional.  recheck at 1pm with platelets as well
   -send haptoglobin
   #. Elevated Coags: Likely due to decreased synthetic function in the

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, metastatic to the bone and liver. She presents with dysphagia and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic failure, fulminant renal failure, and acute renal failure. She also has a history of cancer, hypotension, and dehydration. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 113/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The imaging studies reveal collapsed gallbladder, multiple hepatic hypodensities compatible with known metastatic disease to the liver, moderate right hydronephrosis, and moderate amount of ascites.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection/sepsis: The patient is immunocompromised due to her cancer treatment, making her susceptible to infections. Her elevated white blood cell count and fever could indicate an infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggest a bleeding tendency due to liver dysfunction.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of breast cancer that has metastasized to the liver and bone. She presents with dysphagia and hypotension. The patient is immunocompromised due to chemotherapy and steroids. The patient's vital signs show persistent tachycardia (heart rate of 122 bpm) and hypotension (blood pressure ranging from 113/63 to 126/83 mmHg). Respiratory rate is 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the new symptoms of dysphagia and hypotension.

The patient's laboratory results indicate hepatic failure, with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 150/200), elevated bilirubin levels (Alk Phos/T Bili: 515/18.3), and a low albumin level (1.9 g/dL). Renal failure is also evident, with a high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine (Cr) ratio, elevated lactate levels, and anuria. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 7.7), slightly low hemoglobin level (Hct: 41.9), and normal platelet count (Plt: 150).

Imaging studies reveal collapsed gallbladder, multiple hepatic hypodensities consistent with known metastatic"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer now with presentation with
   significant hypotension in the setting of increased dosing of dilaudid
   needed for severe oral/esophageal pain which in the setting of
   significant hepatic dysfunction may have had prolonged effects and now
   with time patient has had substantial improvement in mental status and
   blood pressure and now is faced with modest persistent renal
   dysfunction and extra-vascular volume overload.  This has all trended
   to better with most prominent issue going forward working to establish
   a regimen to provide stability in regards to volume status with likely
   role for diuretics with caution given recent hypotension.
   1)Altered Mental Status-
   -Lactulose
   -Dilaudid minimized
   -Blood pressure improved
   -Will continue to monitor exam but very reassuring now
   2)Hypotension-This is likely a combination of narcotics with extensive
   impact in the setting of ongoing difficulty with intravascular volume
   with hepatic failure.
   -Vanco/Zosyn
will D/C if cultures negative at 72 hours
   -Dex 12mg IV qd
   -Albumin [**Hospital1 7**]
   -GCV in place
   -Will move to D/C albumin at 48 hours with hope for improved balance
   across time
   3)Oliguria-Patient has significant oliguria but preserved Creatinine
   levels
we have seen increase in urine output across time
   -Will continue with Albumin across time
   -Will move to standing diuretic starting at low dose
   4)CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST-
   -Appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**]
s input
   -Will work to discuss with family goals of her care and path to
   treatment from here
   5)Hepatic Failure-
   -Patient with persistent hyperbilirubinemia and elevation of AP with
   mild persistent elevation of transaminases
   -Continue with lactulose
   -Will need to maintain
   6)Esophagitis-Likely a combination of fungal and viral contribution
   -Will continue with Fluconazole as well as gancyclovir
   -Local pain control

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with significant hypotension, altered mental status, and other health issues. The patient has experienced improvement in blood pressure and mental status but still has modest persistent renal dysfunction and extra-vascular volume overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's use of narcotics and hepatic failure may have prolonged effects on her mental status. Monitoring the patient closely is essential to ensure she maintains stability.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of narcotics and difficulty with intravascular volume, exacerbated by hepatic failure. Careful management of fluid balance and consideration for diuretics will be necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.

3. Oliguria: The patient has significant oliguria but preserved creatinine levels. Close monitoring of urine output and continued use of albumin infusion will help improve renal function over time.

4. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Breast: The patient's breast cancer will require ongoing discussion with the family regarding goals of care and treatment options moving forward.

5. Hepatic Failure: The patient exhibits persistent hyperbilirubinemia and elevation of AP with mild persistent elevation of transaminases. Management of hepatic failure will involve continuing lactulose and maintaining adequate nutrition.

6. Esophagitis: The patient may have esophagitis"

   Assessment and Plan
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension and now with BRPBR.
   # GI Bleed: BRBPR yesterday.  Gave vitamin K and stopped enoxaparin.
   Subsequent Hct have been stable at 31.  No further episodes of red
   blood in stool. PTT continues to be elevated.
   -continue [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   -consider protamine if further episodes bleeding or Hct drop
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.
   -Cotinue fluconazole for candidal esophagitis for 14-21 days
   - continue Ganciclovir ([**11-13**]-present); course for immunocompromised pt
   [**Name (NI) **] is 3-6 weeks, which is appropriate in this case.
   #.  Hypotension: Improved, likely dehydration in setting of poor PO
   intake with dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and
   hyponatremia.  Also on ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's
   immunocompromised state, PE, splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD,
   bleeding unlikely given stable to elevated hematocrit at admission.
   MAPS now high 70s.
   - prn albumin if becomes acutely hypotensive or tachycardia worsens
   - d/c Vanc/Zosyn as sepsis unlikely with negative blood ctx X48H.
   - Trippled home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this (last day today)
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   # Liver Failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Could also be
   caused by CMV.  Liver dysfunction is likely contributing to full body
   volume overload, leading to peripheral edema and ascites.
   -plan to restart home dose PO lasix and aldactone today
   - prn albumin as above
   -aggressive nutrition
   - hold lactulose for now
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Resolved. Likely from dilaudid use and
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension, infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain
   metastases.   Overall improved today, might be because of increased
   perfusion of prain.  CMV could also account for mental status changes
   rarely.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -pt has not been receiving lactulose regularly; will only use if mental
   status worsens
   - will hold on head CT for now given improvement and likely need for
   contrast to evaluate mets
   .
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, however
   this is improving with BPs.  Could also be from pain.  Diff dx includes
   PE, however would likely not alter management and would require dye for
   CTA.
   -continue volume repletion prn
   -continue telemetry monitoring
   .
   #. Elevated Coags: Likely due to decreased synthetic function in the
   liver. Now trending down except for bili.  DIC labs normal.  Lovenox
   Factor Xa appropriate at 0.88.
   -lovenox stopped
   -consider protamine if further bleeding as above
   #   Breast cancer
   -per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**] hospice care sounds appropriate discussion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of breast cancer that has metastasized to the bone and liver. She presented with dysphagia, hypotension, and bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract (BRBPR). The patient is immunocompromised due to chemotherapy and steroids, and she also has liver failure. She has been diagnosed with candidal esophagitis and is receiving treatment with fluconazole. Additionally, she is being treated for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with ganciclovir.

The patient's hypotension is believed to be caused by dehydration, diuretic use, high BUN/creatinine ratio, and hyponatremia. Infection or sepsis is also considered as a potential cause. The patient's blood cultures have been negative for 48 hours.

The patient's liver failure is significant, with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. There is no evidence of biliary obstruction on ultrasound. The patient's peripheral edema and ascites are thought to be due to fluid overload caused by liver dysfunction.

The patient's mental status has improved, likely due to increased perfusion and resolution of hepatic encephalopathy. Pain management is important, and the use of dilaudid should be carefully monitored.

The patient's elevated coagulation parameters are attributed to decreased synthetic function in the liver. The patient was on enoxaparin, but"

No nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, or palpitations were reported. The patient has allergies to Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Penicillins, and Vitamin B Complex. 

24-hour events include the arterial line stopping, administration of IV Lasix due to hct drop, development of BRBPR (blood-tinged pink frothy rash), vitamin K administration, and discontinuation of enoxaparin.

   Assessment and Plan
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   # GI Bleed: BRBPR yesterday.  Gave vitamin K and stopped enoxaparin.
   Subsequent Hct have been stable at 32.  No further episodes of red
   blood in stool. PTT continues to be elevated.
   -continue [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   -consider protamine if further episodes bleeding or Hct drop
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days given thrush on exam, now also on Ganciclovir since [**11-13**].
   course for Ganciclovir for immunocompromised pt [**Name (NI) **] is 3-6 weeks
   depending on if sxs are resolving
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit at admission.  MAPS now high 70s.
   - continue albumin dose at noon today, dose with spironolactone and
   lasix given peripheral edema
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - d/c Vanc/Zosyn as sepsis unlikely with negative blood ctx X48H.
   - Trippled home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this (last day today)
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain
   metastases.   Overall improved today, might be because of increased
   perfusion of prain.  CMV could also account for mental status changes
   rarely.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose seems to have cleared MS some, continue
   - will hold on head CT for now given improvement and likely need for
   contrast to evaluate mets
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, however
   this is improving with BPs.  Could also be from pain.  Diff dx includes
   PE, however would likely not alter management and would require dye for
   CTA.
   -continue volume repletion
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be
   caused by CMV.
   -hold diuretics for now
   -aggressive nutrition
   -lactulose
   # Hct drop: likely dilutional.  recheck at 1pm with platelets as well
   -guiaic stools
   -active T&S
   #. Elevated Coags: Likely due to decreased synthetic function in the
   liver. Now trending down except for bili.  DIC labs normal.  Lovenox
   Factor Xa appropriate at 0.88.
   #   Breast cancer
   -per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**] hospice care sounds appropriate discussion.
   #.  Hypercalcemia.  A recurrent problem for this patient with widely
   metastatic cancer. Corrected ca has normalized to 9.1
   -continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer that has metastasized to the bone and liver. She presented with dysphagia and hypotension. The patient experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, indicated by bloody red blood cell pellet in the urine, and was given vitamin K and stopped on enoxaparin. Her hematocrit (Hct) dropped but stabilized at around 32%. The patient also has candidal esophagitis, which has been treated with fluconazole, and is on ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. She is also being treated for liver failure, likely due to extensive liver metastases.

Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed, resulting in bloody red blood cell pellet in the urine. She was given vitamin K and stopped on enoxaparin. Her Hct dropped but stabilized at around 32%. Further episodes of bleeding or Hct drop may require protamine administration.
2. Dysphagia: The patient's dysphagia is likely due to candidal esophagitis, which has been treated with fluconazole. She is also on ganciclovir for CMV infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to dehydration in the setting of poor oral intake with dysphagia, diuretic use, high blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/cre"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer admitted with oro-pharyngeal
   candidiasis with course complicated by hypotension.  We had substantial
   concern for worsening respiratory status but today has increased
   comfort with limitation on further fluid being given.
   1) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED,
   GIB)-HCT has been without change
   -Follow stool output
   -Will provide vitamin K for support
   -Will need to consider FFP for any further bleeding
   2)HYPOTENSION-This has been considered multifactorial with relative
   compromise of effective filling pressures, substantial decrease in
   oncotic pressure and vasodilatory effects of dilaudid with prolonged
   impact in the setting of hepatic dysfunction and possible infection
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -Dex 12mg/d
   -Emiric antibiotics will be D/C
d at 72 hours of culture negative
   -GCV--for positive CMV viral load
   -Will move to aldactone lasix
   3)ALTERED MENTAL STATUS-
   -Lactulose
   4)ORO-PHARYNGEAL PAIN-This is likely related to fungal infection with
   significant pain noted with good response to local treatment
   -Fluconazole to continue
   -Will continue with local Rx
   5)HEPATIC FAILURE--likely secondary to metastatic insult from breast
   cancer mets.
   -Lactulose
   -Lasix/Aldactone
   -Albumin as needed for hypotension was reasonable but not needed now
   -Will need to follow coagulopathy going forward
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Will move to PO intake today as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for oropharyngeal candidiasis. She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, altered mental status, and hepatic failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, which is believed to be multifactorial. She has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, antifungals, and medications for pain management. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 97/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, diminished breath sounds, and soft non-tender abdomen. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, altered mental status, and hepatic failure. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status, further bleeding, and infection."
