","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with severe sepsis or septic shock, possibly secondary to a fluid collection near his right shoulder. He also has acute renal failure and altered mental status. The source of infection is suspected to be either the right shoulder joint or the abdomen. The patient has received vancomycin, piperacillin, and levofloxacin. Arthrocentesis was performed successfully this morning, and cultures from the joint fluid, blood, and urine are pending. The patient's condition has stabilized with fluid resuscitation and stress-dose steroids. He is currently off pressors and is being monitored closely. A central venous catheter may be placed if the patient becomes hypotensive. The plan includes conducting a stim test and weaning steroids today, continuing with antibiotics, and further investigating the cause of the acute renal failure. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to pain or anxiety, and mild transaminitis is expected to resolve spontaneously. The altered mental status could be due to alcohol withdrawal, and appropriate measures are being taken. A CT scan of the head will be done to rule out subdural hematoma. Screening for Lyme and Erhlichia diseases is also planned. The patient's nutritional needs will be addressed, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP will continue. Restraints will be reviewed as necessary."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with severe sepsis and possible septic shock, who has developed acute renal failure and altered mental status. The source of infection is suspected to be a fluid collection near his right shoulder, although abdominal sources are also being considered. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin) and will continue with these until culture results are available. If there is a high suspicion of infection in the shoulder joint, a plan for surgical debridement will be made. Blood cultures and urine cultures have been obtained, and further imaging studies are needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Progression of sepsis or septic shock: The patient's condition may worsen if the infection spreads or if the source is not effectively treated.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which can lead to further deterioration in kidney function if not managed appropriately.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen if the underlying cause, such as infection or withdrawal, is not identified and treated.
4. Septic arthritis: If the fluid collection near the right shoulder is indeed an infected joint, it may require surgical intervention to prevent joint destruction.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenalectomy raises concerns for adrenal insufficiency, which can complicate the management of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred from another hospital for septic shock with a likely source of infection in the right shoulder joint. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 144 bpm, blood pressure of 161/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. 

The physical examination reveals a supple neck with no jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy, clear lungs, tachycardic heart rhythm, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs or rubs, a surgical incision scar, moderately distended abdomen, bowel sounds present, and no rebound tenderness or guarding. The patient has well-perfused extremities, but his right shoulder is very painful with movement. Additionally, the patient has a diffuse erythematous rash over his trunk, chest, and arms. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 136 mg/dL, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L, and other abnormalities in"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, who was transferred from another hospital for septic shock with a suspected source of infection in the right shoulder joint. The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to ethanol withdrawal or stress dose steroids. There are concerns about possible head trauma, but a head CT did not reveal any acute intracranial process. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia and atrial flutter with premature atrial contractions. There is evidence of renal failure, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. The patient has a diffuse erythematous rash, which may be related to medication or Lyme/erlichia infection. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient presented with altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia, indicating a possible septic shock. Immediate management is required to stabilize the patient's vital signs and treat the suspected infection in the right shoulder joint.
2. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient's history of heavy alcohol use raises concerns for ethanol withdrawal, which can cause agitation and altered mental status. Appropriate management with benzodiazepines should be considered.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient underwent adrenalectomy and may be experiencing adrenal insufficiency, as indicated by hyponatremia and hyperkalem"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with altered mental status. He has a history of heavy opiate use and is currently experiencing agitation, delirium, and possible sepsis. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia (heart rate of 110 bpm), high blood pressure (188/33 mmHg), and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 94% with the use of a nasal cannula.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin), antipsychotics (Ativan and Haldol), and other ICU medications such as Pepcid, Heparin Sodium, Metoprolol, and Lorazepam. The patient also has several ongoing medical issues, including acute renal failure, transaminitis, tachycardia with atrial flutter, constipation, and abdominal distension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, delirium, agitation, and potential intubation if the agitation continues. The patient's renal function is improving with IV fluids, but close monitoring is needed. The tachycardia needs to be controlled, and further evaluation with an echocardiogram is required. Constipation should be treated, but the agitation poses a challenge at the moment. Additionally, the patient's nutrition status should be assessed and managed appropriately."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with an altered mental status, previously suspected of having a right shoulder septic arthritis. However, this diagnosis seems less likely now. The patient remains very delirious and agitated. The possible causes for his altered mental status include encephalopathy due to heavy opiate use, potential withdrawal or pain-related agitation, and the use of steroids and levofloxacin. The patient's agitation is not responding to heavy doses of antipsychosis medication. Other medical issues include acute renal failure, transaminitis, tachycardia with atrial flutter, and constipation with abdominal distension. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and further diagnostic tests, such as an MRI of the brain and an echo, to evaluate the cause of his altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's agitation and altered mental status indicate delirium, which can lead to complications like falls, fractures, pressure ulcers, and infections.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased risk of infections, and the need for dialysis.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's tachycardia with atrial flutter increases the risk of arrhythmias, heart failure, and thromboembolic events.
4. Constipation and abdominal distension: These symptoms can lead to discomfort, decreased"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and likely right shoulder joint infection. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Agitation: The patient has been receiving increasing doses of haloperidol without effect, but showed improvement with lorazepam. Agitation continues to be managed with higher doses of haloperidol.
2. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation, especially with the use of opioids. A bowel regimen has been initiated to address this issue.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient is experiencing tachycardia with atrial flutter and PACs. Metoprolol has been started to manage the heart rate.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to hypovolemia, shock/acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or analgesic nephropathy. Fluid resuscitation is ongoing, and close monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine levels is important.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be related to adrenal insufficiency. Correction of sodium levels should be done cautiously.
6. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes without pain on palpation. This could be due to alcohol use, drug-induced liver injury, or Lyme/erlichia infection. Trending of liver function tests and further investigation for Lyme/"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU for septic shock with a likely source of infection in the right shoulder joint. He also has a history of heavy illicit drug use. The patient presented with altered mental status, which may be related to alcohol withdrawal, narcotic withdrawal, or stress dose steroids. He is experiencing agitation and has a diffuse erythematous rash. The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.3, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and elevated liver enzymes. He is also tachycardic and has atrial flutter with PACs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may be due to alcohol withdrawal. It is important to monitor for signs of delirium tremens and seizures.
2. Septic shock: The patient's presentation with septic shock suggests a severe infection, possibly originating from the right shoulder joint. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary. Measures should be taken to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
4. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia: The patient's low sodium and high potassium levels may be related to adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring of electroly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of increasing agitation. The patient received increasing doses of haldol for agitation without effect and was subsequently switched to ativan with improvement in agitation. The patient was intubated for agitation and to receive appropriate workup, including a CT scan of the abdomen which results are pending. Cultures from [**Location (un)**] prior to transfer showed no growth in urine and blood cultures.

Medical History:
The patient has a history of no known drug allergies. The patient received piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and metoprolol. The patient also received heparin sodium prophylaxis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with altered mental status. He has a history of heavy opiate use and is suspected to be experiencing withdrawal or pain-related agitation. The patient was intubated yesterday due to agitation and the need for diagnostic testing. He responded well to lorazepam but was eventually intubated. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/62 mmHg to 173/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is currently sedated with propofol and comfortable.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal bibasilar consolidation/infiltrate in the lungs but no apparent pathology on a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. Microbiology results are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concerns include encephalopathy/altered mental status, possible sepsis, question of volvulus, acute renal failure, and tachycardia. The plan includes sedation with propofol, administration of thiamine and folate, further testing including an MRI brain and possible lumbar puncture if there is continued obtundation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with altered mental status. He was previously suspected to have a right shoulder septic arthritis, but this is now less likely. The patient was intubated yesterday evening for agitation and the need for diagnostic testing. He has a history of heavy opiate use at OSH, which may be contributing to his current encephalopathy or altered mental status. The CT head was negative, and the patient responded well to lorazepam but ultimately required intubation. He is currently sedated with propofol and appears comfortable. The patient is also receiving thiamine and folate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient may have sepsis, with the most likely source being a bibasilar pneumonia seen on imaging. This could be related to aspiration due to his obtundation.
2. Volvulus: There is a question of volvulus, although it was not seen on the CT a/p with PO contrast. The patient has significant constipation, so stool softeners for bowel movements have been ordered.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had acute renal failure but is now resolving with IV fluids.
4. Tachycardia: The patient experienced tachycardia, and an ECG showed a flutter. Rate control with metoprolol has been initiated, and an echo is pending today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, who was transferred to the ICU for septic shock with a suspected source in the right shoulder joint. He has altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient also has pneumonia with consolidation in the bilateral lung bases on CT abdomen, but it is more likely mild chronic aspiration. Ehrlichia serologies are pending. The patient is currently on a ventilator and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient presents with signs of septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia with consolidation in the bilateral lung bases, which can worsen over time if not treated appropriately.
3. Ehrlichia Infection: Although Ehrlichia serologies are pending, the patient's symptoms may suggest an Ehrlichia infection, which can cause severe illness if not treated promptly.
4. Right Shoulder Joint Infection: The patient has a suspected source of infection in the right shoulder joint. If this is confirmed, it may require surgical intervention.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various causes such as head trauma, alcohol abuse, or sepsis. It requires close monitoring and management.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had a peak creatinine level of 3."

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU for septic shock with a likely source of infection in the right shoulder joint. He has altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient also has pneumonia on CT scan. There is concern for septic right shoulder joint, although the tap of the shoulder joint does not match this concern. Ehrlichia serologies are pending.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), famotidine (Pepcid), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). He is also receiving propofol infusion.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 91 bpm with a range of 59-104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 159/100 mmHg to 113/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute with a range of 16-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally with bronchial sounds at the bases, no rales, regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is described as moderately distended, with bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock with a likely source in the right shoulder joint. He required intubation for studies on [6/2/2184]. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has leukocytosis and bandemia. He also has pneumonia on CT and concern for septic right shoulder, although the tap of the shoulder joint does not align with this. Ehrlichia serologies are pending. The patient is currently off haldol/ativan as sedated. Thiamine, folate, MVI, and Erlichia serologies are being followed up on. The patient is on a planned 9-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient presents with altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia, indicating a possible ongoing infection. There is concern for septic right shoulder although the fluid culture from the shoulder joint does not confirm this. Ehrlichia infection is also being considered.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia on CT, which could be contributing to his respiratory symptoms and overall condition.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to a combination of factors such as sepsis, alcohol abuse, medications, or head trauma. Close monitoring and management are necessary.
4. Shoulder pain: The patient has shoulder pain, which may be due to the septic joint or another underlying cause. Further evaluation, including fluid culture and MRI, is needed to determine the cause.
5. Constipation: The patient had a previous episode of constipation, which was resolved with stool overnight. Bowel regimen should be continued to prevent further constipation.
6. Tachycardia: The patient has atrial flutter with PACs, and his heart rate improved with sedation. Metoprolol is being given to control the heart rate, and a TTE is awaiting to assess cardiac function.
7. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis with elevated liver enzymes, possibly related to alcohol use or other causes. Trending towards normal, further evaluation is needed.
8. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol.
9. Rash: The patient has a diffuse erythematous rash, which may be a drug rash. It is improving, but monitoring is necessary.
10. Anemia: The patient has decreased Hct, which may be due to fluid resuscitation or other causes. Rechecking the Hct is advised.
11. Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure, which is improving with improved UOP and a FENa of 0.8 suggesting a prerenal etiology. Trending creatinine levels are"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of heavy opiate use presenting with altered mental status. He was intubated yesterday for agitation and need for diagnostic testing. The patient has been diagnosed with encephalopathy/altered mental status, possible sepsis, mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure, and tachycardia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Delayed EtOH withdrawal: The patient's heavy opiate use may contribute to unusual delayed EtOH withdrawal symptoms.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating a previous or ongoing respiratory failure.

3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's obtundation may have led to aspiration, resulting in bibasilar pneumonia.

4. Sepsis: Possible sources of infection include pneumonia or the shoulder joint, although the likelihood of shoulder septic arthritis seems less likely at present.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is resolving with IV fluids.

6. Tachycardia: The patient has a flutter on ECG, and rate control with metoprolol is being considered.

7. Thiamine deficiency: Given the patient's history of heavy opiate use and altered mental status, there is a risk of thiamine deficiency, especially if the patient has been malnourished.

8. Complications related to prolonged bed rest and immobility"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with altered mental status, who was previously suspected of having a right shoulder septic arthritis but now appears less likely. He was intubated yesterday for agitation and the need for diagnostic testing. The patient has a history of heavy opiate use at OSH, which may be related to his current encephalopathy or mental status changes. He received heavy doses of antipsychotics but remained agitated and required intubation for airway protection. The patient is currently sedated with propofol and comfortable, receiving thiamine and folate. He is being evaluated for possible Ehrlichia infection, although this is considered less likely. The patient has a possible sepsis, with the bibasilar pneumonia seen on imaging being the most likely source. He is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. OSH cultures are being followed up, and repeat MRI of the shoulder is awaited. The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to altered mental status and will undergo a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) today. He has acute renal failure, which is resolving with intravenous fluids. The patient also has tachycardia, with an ECG showing a flutter on [**6-1**]. Rate control with metoprolol is being implemented, and an echo is pending today. The rest of the plan aligns with the housestaff note"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU for septic shock and a suspected right shoulder joint infection. He has been intubated and sedated, with altered mental status. The patient has undergone several tests and procedures, including a CT scan of the head without acute processes, MRI of the shoulder pending, and cultures pending. His current medications include propofol, heparin sodium, and fentanyl boluses for pain. He is also receiving tube feeds and has had enemas to address constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a suspected right shoulder joint infection and pneumonia on CT. There is a need to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, but his creatinine levels have improved from 3.1 to 1.0. It is important to continue monitoring his renal function and UOP.
3. Hypotension: The patient presented in septic shock and required intubation. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure should be managed accordingly.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, and he requires sedation. Monitoring for any changes in mental status is crucial.
6. Constipation: The patient had"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and likely right shoulder joint infection. He also has altered mental status, respiratory distress, and multiple other medical conditions.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/69 mmHg to 185/118 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and sedated, with diminished breath sounds bilaterally and bronchial sounds at the bases.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, and slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Imaging studies include a pending MRI of the right shoulder and head, as well as a previous CT scan without acute processes. The patient's urine culture is pending, and there is a concern for possible cecal volvulus based on abdominal imaging.

The patient's current medications include propofol infusion, heparin sodium, and various other medications for his multiple medical conditions. He is also receiving tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for septic shock with a likely source of infection in his right shoulder joint. He has altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia. He also has pneumonia on CT scan. The patient is currently intubated and sedated. He requires further evaluation, including an MRI of the head, shoulder, and abdomen, as well as various laboratory tests. The patient has multiple medical complications including septic shock, shoulder pain, constipation, tachycardia, transaminitis, hypertension, rash, anemia, and acute renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient presents with altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia, which are indicative of sepsis. He also has pneumonia on CT scan, further supporting this diagnosis. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration.
2. Shoulder pain: The patient has pain in his right shoulder, and there is concern for a septic joint. Awaiting fluid culture and MRI results will help determine the cause of the pain and guide further management.
3. Constipation: The patient had a large stool with enema and an episode of cecal volvulus. It is important to continue bowel regimen with senna, colace, lactulose, and suppository to prevent further constipation and complications.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has atrial flutter with PACs, and the rate improved on sedation. Metoprolol should be continued, and a TTE should be performed to assess cardiac function.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to alcohol use or other factors. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and guide treatment.
6. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure, and medications like metoprolol and HCTZ should be continued as tolerated. The restart of losartan (home irbesartan) is also mentioned.
7. Rash: The patient has a diffuse erythematous rash, which may be a drug rash. Monitoring the rash and considering alternative medications if necessary are important.
8. Anemia: The patient's Hct is decreasing, indicating anemia. Rechecking the Hct and investigating the cause of anemia are necessary.
9. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level was previously elevated but has now improved. Monitoring renal function and ensuring appropriate fluid management are important to prevent further renal deterioration.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications. Prompt evaluation and treatment of these conditions are essential for the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   63-year-old man with altered mental status. Previous concern for R
   shoulder septic arthritis which today seems less likely. Intubated [**6-2**]
   pm for agitation and need for diagnostic testing.
   Encephalopathy / altered mental status- hx of heavy opiate use at OSH,
   perhaps some withdrawal or related agitation related to pain. CT head
   negative. Very agitated despite heavy doses of antipsychotics.
   Intubated [**6-2**] pm for airway protection
   -responded very  well to ativan yest pm but intubated in the end. may
   be an unusual delayed EtOH withdrawal like process
   -currently sedated with propofol gtt and comfortable, responded well to
   Ativan bolus
   -thiamine and folate
   -f/u Erhlichia given constellation of AMS + transaminitis + arthralgia
   though this is much much less likely
   -minimize any mild-altering agents
   -MRI brain today
   -wean propofol after testing today
   Possible Sepsis- most likely source at this point could be the
   bibasilar pneumonia seen on imaging, though this was not as apparent on
   admission and may have been related to aspiration in the setting of
   obtundation. Repeat MRI shoulder w/ anterior fluid collection, awaits
   retap
   -vanco / zosyn for now, difficult to course out now but if for
   pneumonia will limit to 10-14d.  Will change to vanco + meropenem given
   drug rash.

   Assessment and Plan
   63-year-old man with altered mental status. Previous concern for R
   shoulder septic arthritis which today seems less likely. Intubated [**6-2**]
   pm for agitation and need for diagnostic testing.
   Encephalopathy / altered mental status- hx of heavy opiate use at OSH,
   perhaps some withdrawal or related agitation related to pain. CT head
   negative. Very agitated despite heavy doses of antipsychotics.
   Intubated [**6-2**] pm for airway protection
   -responded very  well to ativan yest pm but intubated in the end. may
   be an unusual delayed EtOH withdrawal like process
   -currently sedated with propofol gtt and comfortable, responded well to
   Ativan bolus
   -thiamine and folate
   -f/u Erhlichia given constellation of AMS + transaminitis + arthralgia
   though this is much much less likely
   -minimize any mild-altering agents
   -MRI brain today
   -wean propofol after testing today
   Possible Sepsis- most likely source at this point could be the
   bibasilar pneumonia seen on imaging, though this was not as apparent on
   admission and may have been related to aspiration in the setting of
   obtundation. Repeat MRI shoulder w/ anterior fluid collection
   -vanco / zosyn for now, difficult to course out now but if for
   pneumonia will limit to 10-14d.  Will change to vanco + meropenem given
   drug rash.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with altered mental status. He has a history of heavy opiate use and presents with agitation, possibly related to withdrawal or pain. He was intubated for airway protection and is currently sedated with propofol. The patient has a suspected right shoulder septic arthritis, but this is less likely now. He is also being evaluated for encephalopathy and possible unusual delayed EtOH withdrawal. The patient's current medical conditions include possible sepsis, bibasilar pneumonia, acute renal failure, tachycardia with a flutter on ECG, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and bibasilar pneumonia suggest the possibility of sepsis. If not properly managed, this can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory distress. ARDS can progress rapidly and result in significant lung damage if not treated promptly.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has signs of acute renal failure. If left untreated, AKI can lead to permanent kidney damage and require long-term dialysis.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The presence of a flutter on the ECG indicates a potential cardiac arrhythmia. This could progress to a more serious arrhythmia, such as atrial fibr"

","The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred to the hospital for septic shock with a likely source of infection in the right shoulder joint. He presented with acute renal failure, altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient underwent a washout of the septic right shoulder joint and is currently receiving antibiotics for pneumonia and septic shoulder.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise due to his current condition and medical history. These potential complications include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and bedrest.

2. Constipation: The patient may be at risk for constipation due to decreased mobility and medication use.

3. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which can potentially worsen during periods of stress or illness.

4. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, he may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred from another hospital for septic shock with a suspected source in his right shoulder joint. He has impaired skin integrity, constipation, atrial flutter, alcohol withdrawal, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.

The patient's medical history includes a fall, heavy alcohol use, polypharmacy, and no previous illicit drug use. He was intubated for studies and required sedation. His current medications include thiamine, folate, MVI, erlichia serologies pending, and treatment for the shoulder infection.

The patient presented with septic shock, likely due to the septic shoulder. He has leukocytosis and bandemia, and underwent washout of the shoulder joint. He is currently on vancomycin and meropenem for a planned 9-day course. The joint fluid analysis showed 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no microorganisms seen.

The patient also has tachycardia, currently in sinus rhythm with PACs. His rate improved on sedation, and he is being treated with metoprolol for rate control. Biatrial enlargement was seen on TTE, and systemic anticoagulation is being held for now.

The patient has transaminitis, initially presenting with RUQ pain but now resolved. His ehrlichia serology is pending. He"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred from another hospital for septic shock with a likely source in the right shoulder joint. He has impaired skin integrity, constipation, atrial flutter, altered mental status, renal failure, and other medical complications. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. He has pneumonia on chest X-ray and abnormal imaging in the shoulder. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis and bandemia. The patient's condition is improving, but he requires continued monitoring and management of his various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's initial presentation was septic shock, and there is concern for ongoing infection, particularly in the right shoulder joint.
2. Pneumonia: The chest X-ray indicates consolidation and collapse of the left lower lobe, suggesting pneumonia.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as evidenced by an elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output.
4. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which could be attributed to several factors including alcohol withdrawal, sepsis, or other underlying medical conditions.
5. Atrial Flutter: The patient has developed atrial flutter, which may require further evaluation and management.
6. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which can be a side effect of medications or decreased mobility.
7. Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of altered mental status, right shoulder septic arthritis, and heavy opiate use. He underwent an arthroscopic open surgical wash-out of his right shoulder and had a TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) yesterday. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and sedation with propofol. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for the septic arthritis and pneumonia. He is also receiving medications for tachycardia and has a plan for rate control. An MRI of the brain will be done today to assess for CVA (cerebrovascular accident) or infection. The patient's condition is critically ill, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. His current treatment includes vancomycin and meropenem, but there is a prolonged course due to the septic shoulder. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic regimen accordingly will be important.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and need for mechanical ventilation indicate acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to ensure adequate gas exchange.
3. Septic arthritis: The patient has a right shoulder septic arthritis, which requires prompt treatment. Regular monitoring of joint function, pain levels, and inflammatory markers is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with an altered mental status, who has been intubated due to agitation and the need for diagnostic testing. He underwent an open surgical wash-out of his right shoulder for septic arthritis. The patient also had a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) yesterday. He has no known drug allergies and received various antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and other medications.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/57 mmHg to 193/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's weight is 126.2 kg, and he has received a total of 3,772 mL of fluids since admission.

Physical examination shows no acute distress, with normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, and soft, non-tender abdomen. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows dilated left atrium and right atrium, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and mild inferior septal hypokinesis on echocardiogram.

Assessment and plan include septic arthritis of the right shoulder, encephalopathy/altered mental status, nosocomial pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, tachycardia, and other conditions. The patient is currently sedated with propofol and responding well to lorazepam. Further tests and treatments are planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has septic arthritis of the right shoulder, and there is a risk of further infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
2. Respiratory issues: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated complications, such as barotrauma, volutrauma, or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
3. Cardiovascular problems: The patient's echocardiogram shows dilated left and right atria, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and mild inferior septal hypokinesis, which may indicate underlying cardiac dysfunction or strain.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status and requires sedation, which carries the risk of prolonged sedation, delirium, or other neurological complications.
5. Medication-related issues: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and antipsychotics, which can have their own side effects and drug interactions.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, imaging findings, and clinical response to treatment to identify and manage any potential complications promptly."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo man with hx of ETOH abuse, [**Hospital 1605**] transfered from OSH for septic
   shock with likely source of right shoulder joint.
   Septic shock/Septic Shoulder/HAP: Likely [**12-29**] to septic shoulder with
   component of pneumonia as well.  Presents in ARF with altered mental
   status, leukocytosis and bandemia.  Septic right shoulder and now s/p
   washout of shoulder joint.
   - continue vanc, meropenem was planned for [**9-8**] day course for HAP.
   Will ultimately need long term antibiotics (6+ weeks for septic
   shoulder but will attempt to tailor to cultures if possible)
   - f/u arthrocentesis culture
   - f/u ortho recs, esp re: need to take back to OR
   Altered Mental Status: Last mentally cleared approx [**5-25**] while at OSH,
   prior to initiation of dilaudid and flexeril. Concern for head trauma
   given prior fall, but head CT without acute process. Does have h/o
   heavy EtOH, but now only drinks 2/7 nights per week according to wife;
   did seem to have better response to ativan than haldol. No h/o illicit
   drug use prior. Likely [**12-29**] polypharmacy given OSH dilaudid, stress dose
   steroids (now d/c
d).   Lyme serologies negative.  Required intubation
   for studies on [**2184-6-2**]. Increased agitation likely polypharmacy; had
   been doing well on propofol but transitioned to fent/versed for
   hypertriglyceridemia. Question of hyperesthesia on fentanyl.
   - confirm whether ortho will need to take back to OR
   - for short-term, restart propofol with half-dose versed
   - d/c fentanyl; dilaudid boluses prn for pain
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Erlichia serologies pending
   - treat shoulder infection as above
   - attempt to wean sedation and extubate today if possible
   Tachycardia: Atrial flutter v. atrial fib.  Now currently in sinus with
   PACs. Rate improved on sedation.
   - metoprolol 50 PO Q8 for rate control
   - Biatrial enlargement on TTE; holding on systemic anticoagulation for
   now
   Transaminitis: No pain on palpation and RUQ U/S from OSH without
   evidence of cholecystitis. [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-29**] EtOH use. Now resolved.
   - f/u ehrlichia serology
   - switched from propafol to fent/versed due to high trigs
   Hypertension:
   - Cont metoprolol
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] and HCTZ as tolerated
   - Holding home clonidine given mental status
   Rash: Initially, was diffuse and erythematous. Currently improving.
   Concern for drug rash secondary to penicillins (although no documented
   history of drug allergies)
   - changed zosyn to meropenem
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Stable
   - monitor Hct
   S/p adrenalectomy: Initially presented with shock, hyponatremia, and
   hyperkalemia. [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was normal. Steroids discontinued.
   Acute renal failure: Cr down to 1.0 from peak of 3.1 at OSH on [**2184-5-30**]
   with improved UOP.  FENa 0.8 suggests prerenal etiology.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and a likely source of infection in his right shoulder joint. The infection may have also involved pneumonia.

2. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to multiple factors such as heavy EtOH use, polypharmacy, or head trauma. A head CT was performed, which showed no acute process.

3. The patient required intubation for studies and has been sedated with propofol, fentanyl, and versed. The sedation was switched from propofol to fentanyl and versed due to hypertriglyceridemia.

4. The patient has a history of EtOH abuse but now drinks only 2 nights per week. He seems to respond better to ativan rather than haldol.

5. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and bandemia, indicating an infection.

6. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but joint fluid analysis shows no growth of microorganisms.

7. The patient's renal function is improving, with a decrease in creatinine from 3.1 to 1.0.

8. The patient's hypertension is being managed with metoprolol and HCTZ, and clonidine has been discontinued.

9. The patient's rash, initially diffuse and"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital with septic shock, likely secondary to a right shoulder joint infection and component of pneumonia. He was transferred from another hospital for further management. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including altered mental status, leukocytosis, bandemia, septic right shoulder, and pneumonia. He has also had acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level but has since improved. 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, and heparin sodium. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: 
- Temperature: 37.9°C (100.3°F)
- Heart rate: 95 bpm
- Blood pressure: 168/85 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 10 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient is intubated and sedated, with diminished breath sounds bilaterally with bronchial sounds at the bases. His lungs are clear, and his neurologic examination shows that he opens his eyes to command. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.9 thousand/mm³, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated liver enzymes. His renal function has improved, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of alcohol use and is currently in the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 168/85 to 190/92 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, lorazepam, heparin sodium, famotidine, and other ICU medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,303 mL and output of 3,050 mL, with a urine output of 1,925 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode, and supplemental oxygen. The patient's physical examination is mostly not assessed due to agitation and altered mental status.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo man with hx of ETOH abuse, [**Hospital 1605**] transfered from OSH for septic
   shock with likely source of right shoulder joint.
   Septic shock/Septic Shoulder: Likely [**12-29**] to septic shoulder with
   component of pneumonia as well.  Presents in ARF with altered mental
   status, leukocytosis and bandemia.  Septic right shoulder and now s/p
   washout of shoulder joint.
   - continue vanc, meropenem was planned for [**9-8**] day course for pna.
   Will ultimately  need long term antibiotics (6+ weeks for septic
   shoulder but will attempt to tailor to cultures if possible)
   - f/u arthrocentesis culture
   - f/u ortho recs
   Altered Mental Status: Last mentally cleared approx [**5-25**] while at OSH,
   prior to initiation of dilaudid and flexeril. Concern for head trauma
   given prior fall, but head CT without acute process. Does have h/o
   heavy EtOH, but now only drinks 2/7 nights per week according to wife;
   did seem to have better response to ativan than haldol. No h/o illicit
   drug use prior. Likely [**12-29**] polypharmacy given OSH dilaudid, stress dose
   steroids (now d/c
d).   Lyme serologies negative.  Required intubation
   for studies on [**2184-6-2**].
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Erlichia serologies pending
   - treat shoulder infection as above
   - attempt to wean sedation and extubate today if possible
   Tachycardia: Atrial flutter v. atrial fib.  Now currently in sinus with
   PACs. Rate improved on sedation.
   - metoprolol 50 PO Q8 for rate control
   - Biatrial enlargement on TTE; holding on systemic anticoagulation for
   now
   Transaminitis: No pain on palpation and RUQ U/S from OSH without
   evidence of cholecystitis. [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-29**] EtOH use. Now resolved.
   - f/u ehrlichia serology
   - switched from propafol to fent/versed due to high trigs
   Hypertension:
   - Cont metoprolol
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] and HCTZ as tolerated
   - Holding home clonidine given mental status
   Rash: Initially, was diffuse and erythematous. Currently improving.
   Concern for drug rash secondary to penicillins (although no documented
   history of drug allergies)
   - changed zosyn to meropenem
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Stable
   - monitor Hct
   S/p adrenalectomy: Initially presented with shock, hyponatremia, and
   hyperkalemia. [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was normal. Steroids discontinued.
   Acute renal failure: Cr down to 1.0 from peak of 3.1 at OSH on [**2184-5-30**]
   with improved UOP.  FENa 0.8 suggests prerenal etiology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, who was admitted to the hospital due to septic shock and a likely source of infection in his right shoulder joint. He also presented with pneumonia and altered mental status. The patient underwent washout of the shoulder joint and is currently being treated with antibiotics for septic shock. Other medical conditions include atrial flutter with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, transaminitis, rash, anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient also has a history of adrenalectomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is already being treated for septic shock with antibiotics. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has likely pneumonia as well, which should be treated with appropriate antibiotics.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status needs to be closely monitored. Sedation may be required, but it should be gradually reduced to assess the patient's ability to breathe independently.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed with medication and lifestyle changes.
5. Transaminitis: This condition has resolved, but it should be monitored for any signs of recurrence.
6. Rash: The rash may be due to a drug allergy, so it is important to continue monitoring and consider alternative medications if necessary.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia should be monitored"

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of alcohol abuse and chronic liver disease, admitted to the ICU for sepsis and acute renal failure. He underwent an MRI brain which showed no stroke or vascular occlusion and was unremarkable. The patient required high doses of sedation with propofol switched to fentanyl/versed due to extremely high triglyceride levels of 999. He also received zyprexa and seroquel for agitation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 168/85 mmHg to 107/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation with FiO2 set at 40%. His physical examination shows diminished breath sounds bilaterally with bronchial sounds at the bases, no rales, and a supple neck with no JVP elevation or LAD. The patient's right shoulder is bandaged with drains in place. His surgical incision scar appears soft and non-tender with moderate abdominal distention. He has warm, well-perfused extremities with 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Neurological examination reveals the patient opening his eyes to command. Laboratory results show elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo man with hx of ETOH abuse, [**Hospital 1605**] transfered from OSH for septic
   shock with likely source of right shoulder joint.
   Septic shock/Septic Shoulder: Likely [**12-29**] to septic shoulder with
   component of pneumonia as well.  Presents in ARF with altered mental
   status, leukocytosis and bandemia.  Septic right shoulder and now s/p
   washout of shoulder joint.
   - continue vanc, meropenem for planned [**9-8**] day course for pneumonia.
   Will ultimately  need long term antibiotics (6+ weeks for septic
   shoulder but will attempt to tailor to cultures if possible)
   - f/u arthrocentesis culture
   - f/u ortho recs
   - Start fentanyl boluses prn for pain with ativan boluses prn
   Altered Mental Status: Last mentally cleared approx [**5-25**] while at OSH,
   prior to initiation of dilaudid and flexeril. Concern for head trauma
   given prior fall, but head CT without acute process. Does have h/o
   heavy EtOH, but now only drinks 2/7 nights per week according to wife;
   did seem to have better response to ativan than haldol. No h/o illicit
   drug use prior. Likely [**12-29**] polypharmacy given OSH dilaudid, stress dose
   steroids (now d/c
d).   Lyme serologies negative.  Required intubation
   for studies on [**2184-6-2**].
   - MRI head still pending
   - Propofol for sedation, ativan prn for comfort and agitation
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Erlichia serologies pending
   - treat shoulder infection as below.
   - appreciate curbside psych input
   - will attempt to wean vent and sedation as tolerated but will avoid
   extubation until possibility of repeat OR intervention is less likely
   Tachycardia: Atrial flutter v. atrial fib.  Now currently in sinus with
   PACs. Rate improved on sedation.
   - metoprolol 50 PO Q8 for rate control
   - Biatrial enlargement on TTE; holding on systemic anticoagulation for
   now
   Transaminitis: No pain on palpation and RUQ U/S from OSH without
   evidence of cholecystitis. [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-29**] EtOH use. Now resolved.
   - f/u ehrlichia serology
   - will check triglycerides given significant propofol administration
   Hypertension:
   - Cont metoprolol
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] and HCTZ as tolerated
   - Holding home clonidine given mental status
   Rash: Initially, was diffuse and erythematous. Currently improving.
   Concern for drug rash secondary to penicillins (although no documented
   history of drug allergies)
   - changed zosyn to meropenem
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Decreased Hct this AM
   - recheck pm Hct
   S/p adrenalectomy: Initially presented with shock, hyponatremia, and
   hyperkalemia. [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was normal. Steroids discontinued.
   Acute renal failure: Cr down to 1.0 from peak of 3.1 at OSH on [**2184-5-30**]
   with improved UOP.  FENa 0.8 suggests prerenal etiology.
   - trend Cr
   Constipation: KUB concerning for cecal volvulus but not seen on CT
   abdomen.
   - Resolved with lots of stool
   - cont bowel regimen with senna, colace, lactulose, and suppository
   Hyponatremia: Resolved.

The patient has undergone washout of the shoulder joint and is currently being treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and septic shoulder.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 168/85 mmHg to 190/92 mmHg, heart rate between 95 and 115 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has several medical complications including altered mental status, suspected polypharmacy, septic shock, right shoulder infection, atrial flutter with PACs, resolved transaminitis, hypertension, rash, anemia, acute renal failure, constipation, hyponatremia, and respiratory status requiring advanced ETT placement and repeat chest X-ray.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's respiratory status due to pneumonia and mechanical ventilation, further deterioration of kidney function, development of new infections, persistent"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 63-year-old man with several medical conditions and complications. He is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status, septic arthritis in his right shoulder, encephalopathy, nosocomial pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, tachycardia, and other health issues.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.4°F, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/65 to 191/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, high platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal an unremarkable MRI brain and pending joint fluid culture.

The patient's medical history includes heavy opiate use, which may contribute to his altered mental status and possible withdrawal or pain-related agitation. He also has a history of heavy alcohol use, as indicated by the presence of Ehrlichia infection, transaminitis, and arthralgia.

The patient is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem), sedatives (versed and fentanyl), and antipsychotics for agitation. He is also receiving nutritional support through tube feeds, prophylactic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prevention, and venous thrombo"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with altered mental status, septic arthritis in the right shoulder, and a history of heavy opiate use. He was intubated for agitation and the need for diagnostic testing. The patient's current medications include versed, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin sodium, meropenem, losartan, lopressor, colace, peridex, lactulose, vancomycin, MVI, folate, and thiamine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing pneumonia due to mechanical ventilation and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has a heart rate above the normal range, which may be due to infection, sepsis, or a flutter on the ECG.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation for altered mental status and respiratory failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo man with hx of ETOH abuse, [**Hospital 1605**] transfered from OSH for septic
   shock with likely source of right shoulder joint.
   Septic shock/Septic Shoulder/HAP: Likely [**12-29**] to septic shoulder with
   component of pneumonia as well.  Presents in ARF with altered mental
   status, leukocytosis and bandemia.  Septic right shoulder and now s/p
   washout of shoulder joint.
   - continue vanc, meropenem was planned for [**9-8**] day course for HAP.
   Will ultimately need long term antibiotics (6+ weeks for septic
   shoulder but will attempt to tailor to cultures if possible)
   - f/u arthrocentesis culture
   - f/u ortho recs, esp re: need to take back to OR
   Altered Mental Status: Last mentally cleared approx [**5-25**] while at OSH,
   prior to initiation of dilaudid and flexeril. Concern for head trauma
   given prior fall, but head CT without acute process. Does have h/o
   heavy EtOH, but now only drinks 2/7 nights per week according to wife;
   did seem to have better response to ativan than haldol. No h/o illicit
   drug use prior. Likely [**12-29**] polypharmacy given OSH dilaudid, stress dose
   steroids (now d/c
d).   Lyme serologies negative.  Required intubation
   for studies on [**2184-6-2**]. Increased agitation likely polypharmacy; had
   been doing well on propofol but transitioned to fent/versed for
   hypertriglyceridemia. Question of hyperesthesia on fentanyl.
   - confirm whether ortho will need to take back to OR
   - for short-term, restart propofol with half-dose versed
   - d/c fentanyl; dilaudid boluses prn for pain
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Erlichia serologies pending
   - treat shoulder infection as above
   - attempt to wean sedation and extubate today if possible
   Tachycardia: Atrial flutter v. atrial fib.  Now currently in sinus with
   PACs. Rate improved on sedation.
   - metoprolol 50 PO Q8 for rate control
   - Biatrial enlargement on TTE; holding on systemic anticoagulation for
   now
   Transaminitis: No pain on palpation and RUQ U/S from OSH without
   evidence of cholecystitis. [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-29**] EtOH use. Now resolved.
   - f/u ehrlichia serology
   - switched from propafol to fent/versed due to high trigs
   Hypertension:
   - Cont metoprolol
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] and HCTZ as tolerated
   - Holding home clonidine given mental status
   Rash: Initially, was diffuse and erythematous. Currently improving.
   Concern for drug rash secondary to penicillins (although no documented
   history of drug allergies)
   - changed zosyn to meropenem
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Stable
   - monitor Hct
   S/p adrenalectomy: Initially presented with shock, hyponatremia, and
   hyperkalemia. [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was normal. Steroids discontinued.
   Acute renal failure: Cr down to 1.0 from peak of 3.1 at OSH on [**2184-5-30**]
   with improved UOP.  FENa 0.8 suggests prerenal etiology.
   - trend Cr
   Constipation: KUB concerning for cecal volvulus but not seen on CT
   abdomen. Resolved with lots of stool
   - cont bowel regimen with senna, colace, lactulose, and suppository

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for septic shock with likely sources in the right shoulder joint and pneumonia. The patient underwent a washout of the shoulder joint and is currently being treated with antibiotics for both septic shoulder and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's mental status has been altered, possibly due to heavy EtOH use, polypharmacy, or a previous fall. However, a head CT did not show any acute processes. The patient also has a history of heavy EtOH use but now only drinks 2 nights per week, according to his wife.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, which improved with sedation, and hypertension that is being managed with medications. The patient also has a rash, initially diffuse and erythematous, but currently improving, which may be a drug rash secondary to penicillins. 

The patient has several other medical issues, including acute renal failure, anemia, and constipation. His renal function has improved, and he is no longer on steroids. He is also experiencing hyponatremia, which has resolved.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP bundle implementation. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in"

   component of pneumonia as well.  Presents in ARF with altered mental
   status, leukocytosis and bandemia.  Septic right shoulder and now s/p
   washout of shoulder joint.
   - continue vanc, meropenem was planned for [**9-8**] day course for HAP.
   Will ultimately need long term antibiotics (6+ weeks for septic
   shoulder but will attempt to tailor to cultures if possible)

   - f/u ortho recs, esp re: need to take back to OR
   Altered Mental Status: Last mentally cleared approx [**5-25**] while at OSH,
   prior to initiation of dilaudid and flexeril. Concern for head trauma
   given prior fall, but head CT without acute process. Does have h/o
   heavy EtOH, but now only drinks 2/7 nights per week according to wife;
   did seem to have better response to ativan than haldol. No h/o illicit
   drug use prior. Likely [**12-29**] polypharmacy given OSH dilaudid, stress dose
   steroids (now d/c

   for studies on [**2184-6-2**]. Increased agitation likely polypharmacy; had
   been doing well on propofol but transitioned to fent/versed for
   hypertriglyceridemia. Question of hyperesthesia on fentanyl.
   - confirm whether ortho will need to take back to OR
   - for short-term, restart propofol with half-dose versed
   - d/c fentanyl; dilaudid boluses prn for pain
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Erlichia serologies pending

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock with suspected right shoulder joint infection. He has undergone washout of the shoulder joint and is currently on long-term antibiotics. The patient has altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia. He also has a history of heavy EtOH use but now only drinks 2 nights per week. There is concern for head trauma due to a prior fall, but a head CT showed no acute process. The patient required intubation for studies on [**2184-6-2**]. He has been agitated despite high doses of fentanyl/versed and was switched back to propofol with half-dose versed. Fentanyl was discontinued due to hyperesthesia and switched to dilaudid prn for pain. The patient's mental status improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, likely secondary to the infected right shoulder joint. He has been treated with antibiotics, but long-term antibiotic therapy will be required.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to various factors including polypharmacy, head trauma, or alcohol abuse.
3. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which may be secondary to stress or underlying conditions.
4. Rash: The patient initially presented with a diffuse erythematous rash,"

The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and septic shoulder, both of which are suspected to have caused the septic shock. The patient presented with altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Septic shock/Septic Shoulder/HAP: The patient likely has septic shock with components of pneumonia as well. He is currently on antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and meropenem.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and he is at risk for head trauma given his prior fall. However, a head CT scan did not show any acute processes. The patient has a history of heavy alcohol use but only drinks 2 nights per week according to his wife. He responded better to ativan compared to haldol, indicating a possible polypharmacy.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has rapid heart rates in the morning, unclear trigger. Biatrial enlargement was observed on TTE. The patient will be transitioned from metoprolol to diltiazem drip and systemic anticoagulation will be held.
4. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure that will be managed with diltiazem drip, along with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, who was admitted to the hospital for septic shock and a likely source of right shoulder joint infection. He presented with altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient underwent washout of the shoulder joint and is currently on intravenous antibiotics. He has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, hypertension, rash, anemia, hypotension, acute renal failure, constipation, and hyponatremia. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient was admitted with septic shock likely due to a right shoulder joint infection. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient's vital signs closely.
2. Altered mental status: The patient has persistent agitation despite high doses of sedatives. It is necessary to evaluate and manage the underlying cause of the altered mental status, such as polypharmacy or hypertriglyceridemia.
3. Hypertension: The patient has been hypertensive, especially after discontinuing sedation. It is important to optimize blood pressure control to prevent further complications.
4. Rash: The patient initially presented with a diffuse and erythematous rash. It is crucial to monitor the rash and consider potential drug-related causes, especially since the patient was on penicillin antibiotics.
5. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia. Monitoring hemoglobin"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo man with hx of ETOH abuse, [**Hospital 1605**] transfered from OSH for septic
   shock with likely source of right shoulder joint.
   Septic shock/Septic Shoulder/HAP: Likely [**12-29**] to septic shoulder with
   component of pneumonia as well.  Presents in ARF with altered mental
   status, leukocytosis and bandemia.  Septic right shoulder and now s/p
   washout of shoulder joint.
   - continue vanc, meropenem was planned for [**9-8**] day course for HAP.
   Will ultimately need long term antibiotics (6+ weeks for septic
   shoulder but will attempt to tailor to cultures if possible)
   - f/u arthrocentesis culture
   - f/u ortho recs
   Altered Mental Status: Last mentally cleared approx [**5-25**] while at OSH,
   prior to initiation of dilaudid and flexeril. Concern for head trauma
   given prior fall, but head CT without acute process. Does have h/o
   heavy EtOH, but now only drinks 2/7 nights per week according to wife;
   did seem to have better response to ativan than haldol. No h/o illicit
   drug use prior. Likely [**12-29**] polypharmacy given OSH dilaudid, stress dose
   steroids (now d/c
d).   Lyme serologies negative.  Required intubation
   for studies on [**2184-6-2**]. Increased agitation likely polypharmacy; had
   been doing well on propofol but transitioned to fent/versed for
   hypertriglyceridemia. Question of hyperesthesia on fentanyl.
   - Continue dilaudid boluses prn for pain
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - treat shoulder infection as above
   - [**Month (only) 8**] benefit from psyche consult if patient does not clear today
   Hypertension:
   - Cont metoprolol
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] and HCTZ as tolerated
   - Holding home clonidine given mental status
   Tachycardia: Atrial flutter v. atrial fib.  Now currently in sinus with
   PACs. Rate improved on sedation.  Biatrial enlargement on TTE
   - holding on systemic anticoagulation for now
   - metoprolol 20 IV Q4 for rate control
   Transaminitis: No pain on palpation and RUQ U/S from OSH without
   evidence of cholecystitis. [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-29**] EtOH use. Now resolved.
   Rash: Initially, was diffuse and erythematous. Currently improving.
   Concern for drug rash secondary to penicillins (although no documented
   history of drug allergies)
   - changed zosyn to meropenem
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Stable
   - monitor Hct
   S/p adrenalectomy: Initially presented with shock, hyponatremia, and
   hyperkalemia. [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was normal. Steroids discontinued.
   Acute renal failure: Cr down to 1.0 from peak of 3.1 at OSH on [**2184-5-30**]
   with improved UOP.  FENa 0.8 suggests prerenal etiology.
   - trend Cr
   Constipation: KUB concerning for cecal volvulus but not seen on CT
   abdomen. Resolved with lots of stool
   - cont bowel regimen with senna, colace, lactulose, and suppository
   Hyponatremia: Resolved.

","The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred to the hospital for septic shock with a suspected source in his right shoulder joint. He presents with altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient underwent washout of the shoulder joint and is now on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam, hydromorphone, metoprolol, and hydralazine. The patient has allergies to Zosyn and a rash that was initially diffuse and erythematous but is currently improving. The rash may be a drug rash secondary to penicillins.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. The urine culture is pending, as well as blood cultures from previous dates.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 179/82 to 191/117 mmHg, heart rate of 116 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's mental status is still altered, and he requires intubation for studies.

The patient's assessment and plan include treating septic shock/shoulder joint infection with antibiotics, addressing altered mental status, hypertension, and atrial flutter"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with altered mental status, intubated for agitation and need for diagnostic testing. He has a history of heavy opiate use, which may be contributing to his encephalopathy or withdrawal symptoms. The patient has been diagnosed with septic arthritis in his right shoulder and is currently being treated with antibiotics. He also has nosocomial pneumonia and is receiving treatment with vancomycin and meropenem. The patient's tachycardia is due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is being closely monitored for rate control and the possibility of anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic arthritis of the right shoulder: The patient is at risk for further joint damage and infection spread if not properly managed with antibiotics and surgical intervention if necessary.
2. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient is at risk for worsening respiratory symptoms and potential respiratory failure if the infection is not adequately treated with antibiotics.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient is at risk for complications related to an irregular heart rhythm, such as stroke or heart failure. Rate control measures should be continued, and the decision regarding anticoagulation needs to be made based on the patient's overall condition.
4. Opiate withdrawal or related agitation: The patient may experience withdrawal symptoms due to his heavy opiate use history. Monitoring and providing appropriate pain management and support are crucial to prevent complications associated with withdrawal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with altered mental status, intubated for agitation and need for diagnostic testing. He has a history of heavy opiate use and presents with symptoms suggestive of withdrawal or pain-related agitation. The patient also has a right shoulder septic arthritis, for which he underwent an operative washout. He is being treated with antibiotics and requires follow-up with orthopedics for repeat clean-out. The patient has been diagnosed with nosocomial pneumonia and is receiving appropriate antibiotics. He is also experiencing tachycardia, likely due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, for which rate control measures are being implemented. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and lactic acid levels, indicating possible infection or organ dysfunction. Imaging shows clearing left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic arthritis of the right shoulder: This condition can lead to joint destruction, disability, and systemic infection if not properly managed.
2. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's risk factors for pneumonia include intubation, altered mental status, and prolonged hospital stay. If left untreated, it can progress to severe respiratory distress and sepsis.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: Uncontrolled tachycardia can lead to hemodynamic instability, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of thromboembolic events.

   improvement in degree of atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Mild
   cardiomegaly with no overt evidence of pulmonary edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo man with hx of ETOH abuse, [**Hospital 1605**] transfered from OSH for septic
   shock with likely source of right shoulder joint.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rapid rates throughout the day, unclear trigger.
   Biatrial enlargement on TTE.  He was started on dilt gtt and was given
   3 L of fluid on top of frequent doses of metoprolol.
   - transition metoprolol to 75mg po qid, titrate prn
   - wean off diltiazem drip
   - continue therapeutic heparin
   Septic shock/Septic Shoulder/HAP: Likely [**12-29**] to septic shoulder with
   component of pneumonia as well.  Presents in ARF with altered mental
   status, leukocytosis and bandemia.  Septic right shoulder and now s/p
   washout of shoulder joint with no growth on culture. Exam improving.
   - continue vanc, meropenem was planned for 10 day course for HAP; will
   ultimately need long term antibiotics (6+ weeks of vancomycin for
   septic shoulder but will attempt to tailor to cultures if possible)
   - f/u ortho recs
   - PT consult
   Altered Mental Status: Last mentally cleared approx [**5-25**] while at OSH,
   prior to initiation of dilaudid and flexeril. Concern for head trauma
   given prior fall, but head CT and brain MRI without acute process or
   stroke. Does have h/o heavy EtOH, but now only drinks 2/7 nights per
   week according to wife; did seem to have better response to ativan than
   haldol. No h/o illicit drug use prior. Likely [**12-29**] polypharmacy given

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, who was transferred to the hospital for septic shock with a likely source of infection in the right shoulder joint. He has been experiencing rapid atrial flutter, which has been managed with diltiazem and metoprolol. The patient also has altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia. He underwent washout of the shoulder joint, which showed no growth on culture. The patient's physical examination shows diminished breath sounds bilaterally with bronchial sounds at the bases, a regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and moderately distended abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate in the 90s, blood pressure ranging from 126/62 to 138/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient presented with septic shock, likely due to a combination of pneumonia and septic shoulder. It is important to continue aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics and monitor for any signs of deterioration.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced rapid atrial flutter, which may progress to atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring of the heart rhythm and adjusting the medication regimen as needed are necessary.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for septic shock and likely right shoulder joint infection. The patient has experienced multiple medical complications during his stay in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Septic shock: The patient presented with septic shock, likely due to a septic right shoulder joint infection. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has had rapid atrial flutter and received diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control. Atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of stroke and other cardiac complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient initially had acute renal failure with a peak creatinine level of 3.1, but it has improved to 1.0 now. Renal failure can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as accumulate waste products in the body.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has had episodes of altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as alcohol withdrawal, polypharmacy, or sepsis. Delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be managed with appropriate antihypertensive therapy.

","The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock with a likely source of infection in his right shoulder joint. He presented with acute renal failure, altered mental status, leukocytosis, and bandemia. He underwent washout of the shoulder joint and is currently being treated with antibiotics for the suspected joint infection.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, impaired skin integrity, constipation, atrial flutter, alcohol withdrawal, sepsis without organ dysfunction, renal failure, and altered mental status. He has multiple comorbidities and a history of heavy alcohol use.

His current vital signs include a heart rate in the 90s, blood pressure ranging from 126/62 to 138/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range. His physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally with bronchial sounds at the bases, normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and well-perfused extremities with 2+ pulses.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.9, elevated creatinine level of 2.3, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and slightly elevated potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L. The patient's liver enzymes are within normal range, and his"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of heart rate elevated in the 150s, rapid atrial flutter. The patient received diltiazem and metoprolol, and their heart rate improved to the 100s. However, diltiazem was discontinued and the patient's heart rate increased again to 150s. The patient then received additional diltiazem and metoprolol and successfully converted to sinus rhythm.

The patient has allergies to Zosyn (Intraven) and a rash from the last dose of antibiotics, Vancomycin on 06/08/2184 at 08:24 PM and Meropenem on 06/08/2184 at 02:00 AM.

Infusions include diltiazem at 5 mg/hour and heparin sodium at 2,400 units/hour. Other ICU medications include hydromorphone (Dilaudid) on 06/08/2184 at 01:50 PM, heparin sodium (prophylaxis) on 06/08/2184 at 03:00 PM, diltiazem on 06/08/2184 at 09:44 PM, and metoprolol on 06/09/2184 at 05:35 AM. Famotidine (Pepcid) was also given on 06/09/2184 at 06:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.4°C to 37.3°C, heart rate ranging from 90 to 157 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/62 mmHg to 178/100 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 7 to 20 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's weight remains at 125 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 5,215 mL and total output of 3,550 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,665 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, oxygen through a nasal cannula, and has been weaned off mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination findings include an irregular pulse in the right and left radial arteries, as well as the right and left distal pulses. Skin examination, neurologic examination, and peripheral vascular examination were not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 15.9 to 21.9 thousand/mm³, hematocrit ranging from 28.9% to 30.1%, and platelet count ranging from 293 to 332 thousand/mm³. Blood glucose levels varied between 96 and 179 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated BUN, creatinine, and liver enzymes, with normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows satisfactory positioning of the left-sided PICC line with the tip in the lower superior vena cava and mild cardiomeg"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with several medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is right shoulder septic arthritis. The patient was physically present with the ICU Resident for key portions of the services provided, and the attending physician agrees with the resident's note above, including the assessment and plan.

The patient has a history of altered mental status, which has since resolved. He also had nosocomial pneumonia, which was treated and completed. The patient is intubated for agitation and has been on multiple medications, including antibiotics (Vanco), pain management (Dilaudid), and antianxiety medication (Ativan).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 104 bpm (with a normal range of 90-156 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 146/68 to 162/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 7-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, and elevated platelet count. The creatinine level is elevated at 2.3, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values, including liver enzymes and electrolytes, are relatively normal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of altered mental status, right shoulder septic arthritis, intubation for agitation, nosocomial pneumonia, tachycardia, and an irregular heartbeat. The patient has been treated with various medications including antibiotics, pain relievers, and cardiac medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/62 mmHg to 162/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low calcium level. The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. The patient has ongoing joint fluid cultures pending and will require further evaluation by an infectious disease specialist. The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy for a minimum of 6 weeks, physical therapy for the right shoulder, and weaning off sedatives and pain medications as appropriate. The patient's care will be coordinated with a physical therapist, and the need for restraints will be reviewed regularly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock with a likely source in the right shoulder joint. He also had atrial fibrillation that is now well-controlled on metoprolol. The patient underwent washout of the shoulder joint, which showed no growth on culture. He completed a 10-day course of vancomycin and meropenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and will continue vancomycin for an additional 6 weeks for the septic shoulder. The patient's mental status is improving after being extubated, and he is responding better to ativan than haldol. His labs show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and elevated glucose levels. He has a history of heavy EtOH use but now only drinks 2 nights per week. There are no new imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient was initially admitted for septic shock, likely due to a right shoulder joint infection. Although the source of infection is being treated, there is still a risk of further complications related to sepsis.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently well-controlled on metoprolol. However, there is still a risk of arrhythmias and potential embolic events.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock with a suspected source in his right shoulder joint. He has also had atrial fibrillation, which is now well-controlled with medication. The patient underwent a washout of his shoulder joint, and cultures did not show any growth. He has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and will continue taking vancomycin for an additional six weeks for the septic shoulder. The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial and may be related to heavy alcohol use, polypharmacy, or head trauma. His mental status is improving after being extubated. The patient has hypertension and transaminitis, which have both resolved. He also had a rash that was initially diffuse and erythematous, possibly due to a drug reaction to piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's anemia is stable, and he will be monitored closely. He underwent an adrenalectomy in the past and is no longer taking steroids. The patient is also experiencing constipation, which is being managed with a bowel regimen. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, heparin, and coumadin. He is receiving nutritional support and is on a regular cardiac diet. His lines include an 18-gauge line and a PICC line. Prophylactic measures include boots and therapeutic heparin"

He also has atrial fibrillation, which is now well-controlled on metoprolol, and biatrial enlargement on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). 

The patient's current medications include metoprolol 25 mg orally four times a day for rate control, therapeutic heparin, and coumadin for a goal INR of 12-30. He has completed a 10-day course of vancomycin and meropenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and will continue vancomycin for an additional 6 weeks for septic shoulder. An infectious disease consult is also requested.

The patient has an altered mental status, possibly multifactorial in etiology. AMS started approximately 5 days prior to the initiation of dilaudid and flexeril. There is concern for head trauma given the prior fall, but head CT and brain MRI showed no acute process or stroke. The patient has a history of heavy ethanol use, but now only drinks 2 nights per week according to his wife. He responded better to ativan than haldol. Polypharmacy is likely given the use of dilaudid at OSH and stress dose steroids, which have since been discontinued. Lyme serologies are negative. He required intubation for studies"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo man with hx of ETOH abuse, [**Hospital 1605**] transfered from OSH for septic
   shock with likely source of right shoulder joint.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rapid rates throughout the day, unclear trigger.
   Biatrial enlargement on TTE.  He was started on dilt gtt and was given
   3 L of fluid on top of frequent doses of metoprolol.
   - transition metoprolol to 75mg po qid, titrate prn
   - wean off diltiazem drip
   - continue therapeutic heparin
   Septic shock/Septic Shoulder/HAP: Likely [**12-29**] to septic shoulder with
   component of pneumonia as well.  Presents in ARF with altered mental
   status, leukocytosis and bandemia.  Septic right shoulder and now s/p
   washout of shoulder joint with no growth on culture. Exam improving.
   - continue vanc, meropenem was planned for 10 day course for HAP; will
   ultimately need long term antibiotics (6+ weeks of vancomycin for
   septic shoulder but will attempt to tailor to cultures if possible)
   - f/u ortho recs
   - PT consult
   Altered Mental Status: Last mentally cleared approx [**5-25**] while at OSH,
   prior to initiation of dilaudid and flexeril. Concern for head trauma
   given prior fall, but head CT and brain MRI without acute process or
   stroke. Does have h/o heavy EtOH, but now only drinks 2/7 nights per
   week according to wife; did seem to have better response to ativan than
   haldol. No h/o illicit drug use prior. Likely [**12-29**] polypharmacy given
   OSH dilaudid, stress dose steroids (now d/c
d).   Lyme serologies
   negative.  Required intubation for studies on [**2184-6-2**]. Increased
   agitation likely polypharmacy; had been doing well on propofol but
   transitioned to fent/versed for hypertriglyceridemia. He is now
   extubated and mental status is improving.
   - continue dilaudid boluses prn for pain
   - treat shoulder infection as above
   - minimize polypharmacy: d/c thiamine, folate, MVI, H2 blocker
   - ativan PRN for agitation
   - trazodone prn for insomnia
   Hypertension:
   - increasing metoprolol and weaning dilt gtt
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with an altered mental status and a history of right shoulder septic arthritis. He was intubated for agitation and is currently in the ICU. The patient had a recent operation to wash out his right shoulder and is receiving antibiotic therapy with vancomycin for his septic arthritis. He also has diarrhea, which may be medication-induced and noninfectious, but further evaluation is needed to rule out Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has tachycardia and a flutter on the ECG, likely secondary to hypovolemia. His blood pressure is high, and he requires antihypertensive medication. The patient's coagulation profile shows elevated PT and PTT, but normal INR. He has an elevated WBC count and a low platelet count. His kidney function is mildly impaired, with an elevated creatinine level. Other lab results are within normal range. The patient's microbiology culture is negative. The assessment includes septic arthritis of the right shoulder, altered mental status, agitation, diarrhea, and tachycardia. The plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy, evaluating for infectious disease consultation, managing pain and agitation with appropriate medications, and transitioning from heparin to coumadin. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and communication regarding code status and disposition."
