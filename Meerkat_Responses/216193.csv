   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M w/ biliary atresia s/p liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD,
   MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, pericardial window, presents with
   respiratory distress and bleeding with thoracentesis.
   .
   1. Respiratory Distress:  Likely due to empyema, metabolic
   derangement.  Is now s/p thoracentesis with blood in pleural fluid as
   well as low pH suggesting exudative infection.  Thoracentesis was
   complicated by significant bleeding post-procedure, posing concern for
   hemothorax.  Due to liver failure and ESRD, he has dysfunctional
   platelets and low levels of clotting factors.  He has received 2 units
   of FFP prior to thoracentesis, and 3 additional units following
   procedure given oozing from site. Received DDVAP yesterday morning.
   - will monitor respiratory status closely with concerns for hemothorax
   - F/U with thoracic surgery for and possible definitive procedure for
   empyema given low pH and HCT of 12.5 in pleural fluid
   - Trend CXR
   - oxygen for comfort
   .
   2. Continued Bleeding
 will be difficult to correct his coagulopathy
   due to underlying medical co-morbidities and worsening liver function.
   - receiving pRBC transfusion now, will obtain post transfusion HCT
   - FFP x 2, additional pRBC
   - Serial HCTs and coags
   - Amicar gtt (continuous)
   - DDAVP daily for 3 days (currently day 2 of 3)
   - Dialysis may be helpful in correcting platelet dysfunction, though
   patient may be too tenuous for HD or UF.
   - can consider topical fibrin to help with hemostasis of thoracentesis
   site
   .
   3. Low grade Temps, Leukocytosis: Concern for worsening infection.  He
   is s/p 7 days of Vanc/Cefepime which ended [**2136-2-27**] for VAP. He has a hx
   of MSSA bacteremia and empyema and was on Nafcillin, then Cefazolin
   dosed with HD.  His is on PO Vancomycin for emperic C. Diff coverage
   with multiple C. Diff samples negative.  He has a history of
   Strongyloides antibody positive s/p 1 dose of Ivermectin.  Abx were
   broadened yesterday to Vanc/Cefepime.  WBC trending down today, patient
   afebrile.
   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotcs with Vanc/Cefepime
   - f/u culture data include blood, stool and pleural fluid
   - continue prednisone at 10mg PO qday for adrenal insufficiency
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c PO vancomycin
   .
   4. Worsening Liver Failure: s/p liver transplant at age 4 for biliar
   atresia.  Bilirubin has climbed to 28 since [**2-11**] with rise in INR and
   drop in platelets.  Unclear precipitant. RUQ u/s without new portal
   vein thrombus or ascites.  Infection may be the preciptating factor
   given empyema.  No signs of GI bleeding but has bleeding into pleural
   space.
   - continue to trend daily LFTs
   - f/u with thoracic regarding definative management of empyema and
   possiblity of listing for renal transplant
   - liver recs
   - transplant recs
   - daily tacro levels
   - lactulose [**Hospital1 **] for encephalopathy
   .
   5. ESRD on HD: Dialysis on T/Thurs/Sat. Course complicated by HD line
   infection with MSSA, now s/p new line.
   - continue abx dosed with HD
   - nephrology recs
   - Will F/U with renal team on timing of HD given bleeding
   .
   6. Adrenal insufficiency: Low cortisol level while septic in ICU.  Has
   been tapered to hydrocort 50mg IV BID [**2-25**], to prednisone 20mg daily on
   [**2-27**].  Got Prednisone 15mg on [**2-29**], 10mg on [**3-1**].
   - will continue Prednisone 10mg PO qday
   - No stress dose steroids in light of large infectious burden
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of liver transplant, cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, and pericardial window. He presents with respiratory distress and bleeding following thoracentesis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to empyema, metabolic derangement, and possible hemothorax. Given the low pH and high hematocrit in the pleural fluid, there is a concern for hemothorax. The patient has received two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to thoracentesis and additional units following the procedure due to ongoing bleeding.

2. Continued Bleeding: The patient's bleeding is difficult to correct due to underlying medical comorbidities and worsening liver function. He is receiving packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion, FFP, and topical fibrin to help with hemostasis at the thoracentesis site.

3. Low Grade Temps, Leukocytosis: The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia and empyema. His antibiotics were broadened yesterday to vancomycin and cefepime. Despite being afebrile and having negative"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a chronically ill man who is experiencing multiple complications. He has a history of oozing from the thoracentesis site and has been intubated for ventilatory support. The patient's pain overnight was managed with morphine. Allergies include ibuprofen and an unknown allergen. Antibiotics have been administered, including cefipime and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,204 mL and output of 75 mL. The patient's laboratory results reveal abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of cdiff in the stool culture suggests a possible gastrointestinal infection. Additionally, the patient's low oxygen saturation and abnormal ABG results may indicate respiratory infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Bleeding: The patient's history of oozing from the thoracentesis site and low platelet count raise concerns about bleeding complications.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests possible kidney dysfunction.
4. Liver dysfunction: Abnormal liver function tests, including elevated ALT/AST and alkaline phosphatase levels, indicate potential liver dysfunction.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M w/ biliary atresia s/p liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD,
   MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, pericardial window, presents with
   respiratory distress and bleeding with thoracentesis.
   .
   1. Respiratory Distress:  Likely due to empyema.  Is now s/p
   thoracentesis with blood in pleural fluid as well as low pH suggesting
   infection.  Thoracentesis was complicated by significant bleeding
   post-procedure, posing concern for hemothorax.  Due to liver failure
   and ESRD, he has dysfunctional platelets and low levels of clotting
   factors.  He has received 2 units of FFP prior to thoracentesis, and 3
   additional units following procedure given oozing from site. Received
   DDVAP yesterday morning.
   - will monitor respiratory status closely with concerns for hemothorax
   - F/U with thoracic surgery for definative procedure for empyema given
   low pH and HCT of 12.5 in pleural fluid
   - Trend CXR
   - Serial HCTs and coags
   - Amicar gtt ???
   .
   2. Low grade Temps, Leukocytosis: Concern for worsening infection.  He
   is s/p 7 days of Vanc/Cefepime which ended [**2136-2-27**] for VAP. He has a hx
   of MSSA bacteremia and empyema and was on Nafcillin, then Cefazolin
   dosed with HD.  His is on PO Vancomycin for emperic C. Diff coverage
   with multiple C. Diff samples negative.  He has a history of
   Strongyloides antibody positive s/p 1 dose of Ivermectin.  Abx were
   broadened yesterday to Vanc/Cefepime.  WBC trending down today, patient
   afebrile.
   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotcs with Vanc/Cefepime
   - f/u culture data include blood, stool and pleural fluid
   - continue prednisone at 10mg PO qday for adrenal insufficiency
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   3. Worsening Liver Failure: s/p liver transplant at age 4 for biliar
   atresia.  Bilirubin has climbed to 28 since [**2-11**] with rise in INR and
   drop in platelets.  Unclear precipitant. RUQ u/s without new portal
   vein thrombus or ascites.  Infection may be the preciptating factor
   given empyema.  No signs of GI bleeding but has bleeding into pleural
   space.
   - continue to trend daily LFTs
   - f/u with thoracic regarding definative management of empyema and
   possiblity of listing for renal transplant
   - liver recs
   - transplant recs
   - daily tacro levels
   - lactulose [**Hospital1 **] for encephalopathy
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: Dialysis on T/Thurs/Sat. Course complicated by HD line
   infection with MSSA, now s/p new line.
   - continue abx dosed with HD
   - nephrology recs
   - Will F/U with renal team on timing of HD given bleeding
   .
   5. Adrenal insufficiency: Low cortisol level while septic in ICU.  Has
   been tapered to hydrocort 50mg IV BID [**2-25**], to prednisone 20mg daily on
   [**2-27**].  Got Prednisone 15mg on [**2-29**], 10mg on [**3-1**].
   - will continue Prednisone 10mg PO qday

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has respiratory distress likely due to empyema. There is a concern for hemothorax due to bleeding from the thoracentesis site, which is complicated by liver failure and ESRD causing dysfunctional platelets and low levels of clotting factors. The patient received FFP to address the bleeding and will be monitored closely.

2. Low Grade Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia and empyema, and was previously on antibiotics. Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is a concern for worsening infection. The patient's WBC count is elevated, but trending down, and they are currently afebrile.

3. Worsening Liver Failure: The patient had a liver transplant at age 4 for biliary atresia. Their bilirubin levels have increased to 28 since February 11th, along with an elevated INR and drop in platelets. The precipitant is unclear, but infection may be a contributing factor given the empyema. No signs of GI bleeding have been observed, but there has been bleeding into the pleural space.

4. ESRD on HD: The patient is on dialysis three times a week and had a complication of HD line infection with MSSA, which has since been replaced. The patient's kidney function should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with respiratory distress and bleeding following thoracentesis. The patient failed to respond appropriately to transfusions yesterday and has had continued bleeding. After a family meeting, the decision was made to make the patient comfort measures only (CMO). 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing labored breathing but denies subjective shortness of breath. Oxygen will be provided as needed, but intubation will not be performed.
2. Continued Bleeding: The patient continues to ooze from dressing changes. No further transfusions will be given, and the hematocrit (Hct) and platelet levels will not be trended.
3. Low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis: The patient has low-grade fever and an elevated white blood cell count. Labs and imaging will no longer be trending, and antibiotics have been stopped.
4. Worsening Liver Failure: The patient is not a candidate for liver transplantation. Lactulose may be considered for mental status improvement and interaction with the family.
5. ESRD on HD: No further hemodialysis will be performed.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: No further medications will be administered for adrenal insufficiency.
7. Pain control: The patient reports minimal pain"
