","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), depression/anxiety, obesity, and ulcerative colitis (UC). She presents with shortness of breath and is experiencing an asthma exacerbation. She has been receiving non-invasive ventilation support, including CPAP and BiPAP, as needed. The patient is also on various medications for her conditions, including IV steroids, nebulizers with albuterol and atrovent, montelukast, silicon, fluticasone/salmeterol, tiotropium, CPAP at night, modanifil for OSA, mesalamine for UC, fluoxetine, and aripiprazole for depression with psychotic features, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of asthma and current exacerbation, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as hypoxemia, hypercapnia, respiratory failure, or pneumonia due to increased reliance on non-invasive ventilation support.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and obesity increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure exacerbation.

3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of UC, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or flare-ups.

4. Infection-related Complications: Due"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), depression/anxiety, obesity, and ulcerative colitis (UC). She presents with shortness of breath. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) multiple times during the day due to respiratory distress. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/84 mmHg to 166/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Physical examination reveals a thick neck, clear oropharynx, edentulous maxilla, elevated respiratory sounds, diffuse wheezing, poor airflow, and prolonged expiratory phase. The patient appears to be in moderate distress. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and within normal limits for other blood parameters. 

Radiology images are pending. 

Assessment and plan include suspicion of respiratory acidosis and hypoxia, but this could be due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch rather than infection or pneumonia. The patient does not have any objective findings suggestive of pneumonia. 

Treatment plan involves high-dose steroid burst with IV solumedrol, continuous albuterol nebs, ipratropium, and continued use of home medications such as montelukast and z"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation multiple times throughout the day. The patient has allergies to amoxicillin, which caused a rash and abdominal symptoms in the past. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other medications in the ICU. There are no changes to the patient's medical or family history.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 141/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 760 mL and output of 1059 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 299 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set at a tidal volume of 633 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 106 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 28 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 28 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.7 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 36.0%, platelet count (Plt) of 342 K/uL, blood glucose level of 172 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and code status as full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and glycemic control issues due to the high blood glucose level."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), depression/anxiety, obesity, and ulcerative colitis (UC). She presents with shortness of breath and is currently on non-invasive ventilation support.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Acidosis: The initial ABG results showed respiratory acidosis and hypoxia, but it was later determined to be venous rather than arterial.
2. Asthma Flare: The patient's symptoms could be due to an asthma flare-up.
3. Pickwickian Syndrome: This is a potential complication of OSA in obese patients, characterized by hypoventilation.
4. Fluid Overload: The chest X-ray possibly showed fluid overload, but there were no crackles on examination or history of congestive heart failure (CHF).
5. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a high likelihood of having a PE, given the risk factors and symptoms. A D-dimer test was ordered, but it came back negative, making PE less likely.
6. Pneumonia (PNA): There were no objective findings such as fever, leukocytosis, increased sputum production, or infiltrate on chest X-ray to suggest PNA. Therefore, antibiotics have been withheld for now.
7. Bronchitis: While bronchitis is possible, there are no specific findings to confirm this diagnosis.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), depression/anxiety, obesity, and ulcerative colitis (UC). The patient presents with shortness of breath (SOB).

Respiratory support:
- The patient was placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) twice on 04/09/2173, once from 10:00 AM to 01:00 PM and again from 05:00 PM.
- The patient's respiratory status initially showed respiratory acidosis and hypoxia, but it was later found to be venous rather than arterial.
- The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 633 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- The patient's oxygenation is maintained with an oxygen delivery device other than a mask, and the ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 265.

Physical examination:
- Peripheral vascular examination is incomplete as pulses in both upper and lower extremities are not assessed.
- Skin examination is also not performed.
- Neurologic examination is not assessed due to patient's unresponsiveness and lack of movement.

Labs/Radiology:
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count ("

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of asthma and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) who was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress caused by an asthma exacerbation. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with BiPAP and receiving high-frequency albuterol nebulizations. 

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/83 to 166/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is 145.2 kg, and she is 60 inches tall. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 760 mL and output of 1059 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 299 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes BiPAP with a set respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 22 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 342 K/uL, blood glucose of 172 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL. 

The physical examination reveals a well-nourished, overweight-obese patient with wheezing on auscultation of the chest. The patient's cardiovascular and peripheral vascular examinations are unremarkable. 

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of the patient's asthma and SDB, as well as ICU care, which includes nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with asthma and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) who was admitted with an asthma exacerbation and acute respiratory distress. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, which caused a rash and abdominal symptoms. She is currently on CPAP for SDB and her steroid dose has been weaned. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/83 mmHg to 166/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's weight is 145.2 kg, and she is considered overweight/obese.

24-hour events include the use of CPAP for SDB, weaning of steroids, and obtaining a history from the hospital records. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant measurements.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished, overweight/obese patient with no abnormalities in the eyes/conjunctiva, head/ears/nose/throat, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory/chest, or skin. Neurologic examination was not performed."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), depression/anxiety, obesity, and ulcerative colitis (UC). She presents with shortness of breath and an asthma exacerbation. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated with various medications and interventions.

Assessment:
1. Respiratory: Asthma exacerbation is most likely, with improving symptoms due to nebulizers and steroids. The patient still requires positive pressure ventilation.
2. OSA: The patient is on CPAP at night and using modafinil for treatment.
3. UC: Mesalamine is being continued for ulcerative colitis management.
4. Depression with psychotic features: Fluoxetine and aripiprazole are being continued.
5. GERD: Pantoprazole is being used as a proton pump inhibitor.
6. HTN: Diltiazem is being continued with parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and positive pressure ventilation can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: Obesity and hypertension (HTN) increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: Prolonged use of pantoprazole can lead to Clostridium difficile infection or other gastrointestinal issues.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), depression/anxiety, obesity, and ulcerative colitis (UC). She is currently admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/84 mmHg to 168/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support and requires positive pressure ventilation to feel better. Her lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes, except for a slightly elevated glucose level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and the need for nebs and steroids suggest an asthma exacerbation. If not properly managed, it can lead to respiratory distress or failure.
2. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): As the patient is immobile and has a history of obesity, she is at increased risk of developing blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), depression/anxiety, obesity, and ulcerative colitis (UC). She presents with shortness of breath and an asthma exacerbation. She is currently receiving various treatments including nebulizers, CPAP support, IV steroids, and other medications for her conditions. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 150/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is also being monitored for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current presentation, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's history of asthma puts her at risk for further exacerbations, which can lead to worsening shortness of breath and respiratory distress.
2. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient's OSA increases her risk of respiratory complications during sleep, such as respiratory depression and hypoxemia.
3. Ulcerative colitis (UC) flare-up: The patient's UC can potentially worsen during times of stress or due to other factors, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of asthma and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) admitted with an asthma exacerbation. The patient has shown subjective improvement in shortness of breath but still requires frequent nebulizers. She is currently on Flovent and Serevent.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/79 mmHg to 168/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on CPAP. Her temperature is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in her eyes, head, ears, nose, throat, lymphatic system, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory system, or musculoskeletal system. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. She has absent pulses in both radial and dorsalis pedis arteries, indicating a potential circulatory issue. Her skin is warm, and she is alert, oriented, and responsive to verbal stimuli.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Her blood glucose levels are elevated, but other electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient remains in the ICU due to the high frequency of nebulizers required. She will continue nebulizers and taper IV steroids as tolerated."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with asthma and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) admitted with an asthma exacerbation. She has been receiving nebulizers and showing some improvement in subjective shortness of breath. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, which caused a rash and abdominal symptoms. She is currently on infusions and other ICU medications including Solumedrol and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
- Heart rate: 82 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm
- Blood pressure: 142/79 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on CPAP mask

The patient's weight remains unchanged at 145.2 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,610 mL (720 mL of IV fluids), output of 1,520 mL (720 mL of PO), and a total balance of 775 mL with 20 mL of drainages.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a CPAP mask, with an ABG result of /23/ (indicating acidosis and hypoxemia).

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished, overweight female with no signs of distress or endotracheal tube in place. Her cardiovascular system is normal, and she has scattered end-expiratory wheezes in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of asthma and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), currently admitted for an asthma exacerbation. She is in the ICU receiving nebulizers and IV steroids. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she has a low oxygen saturation level of 93%. The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes and diminished aeration in the chest, indicating respiratory distress. Her abdominal examination shows signs of obesity, but no other significant abnormalities. Lab results show elevated levels of WBC, glucose, and decreased levels of hemoglobin and potassium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's asthma exacerbation and low oxygen saturation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure readings are within normal range, but considering her obesity and the stress of the asthma exacerbation, there is a possibility of cardiovascular complications like heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The elevated WBC count may indicate an underlying infection, which could complicate the patient's condition and require additional treatment.
4. Hypoglycemia: Although the patient's current glucose level is high, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if insulin therapy is initiated or if her glucose levels drop due to other reasons.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's prolonged bedridden state increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), depression/anxiety, obesity, and ulcerative colitis (UC). She presented with shortness of breath (SOB). The patient's peak flow improved from 140 in the morning to 200 in the afternoon after receiving nebulizer treatments (nebs) every 3 hours. The patient's steroids were decreased to 80mg IV Q12 but were kept on IV due to concerns about tapering to oral steroids as she still appeared wheezy yesterday.

Medical History:
- Allergies: Amoxicillin (rash; abdominal)
- Last dose of antibiotics: Infusions
- Other ICU medications: Pantoprazole (Protonix), Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis)
- Other medications: None mentioned

Review of Systems:
The patient slept well and felt better with CPAP. She wears CPAP during the day for increased comfort. Her flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal range, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 93%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 145.2 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 960 mL, with a total output of 1050 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 90 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with CPAP and has an ABG result of ///29/. Physical examination reveals a thick neck, obesity, and diffuse wheezing with improved air flow.

Lab Results:
The lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 12.3 K/uL, increased hematocrit (Hct) at 36.7%, and slightly decreased platelet count (Plt) at 339. Other lab values are within normal range, including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), creatinine (Cr), blood glucose, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4).

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary diagnosis is an asthma exacerbation, which is most likely. Other potential secondary processes such as pulmonary embolism (PE), congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, or pneumonia are less likely due to the absence of fever and leukocytosis. The patient is responding well to nebs and steroids, requiring them less frequently now every 4 hours. The plan includes continuing nebs as tolerated, tapering steroids to 60mg prednisone, and continuing to taper as tolerated. The patient should continue using CPAP as needed and wean off nighttime CPAP. Other medications include montelukast, sildenafil, restarted home fluticasone/salmeterol, tiotroprium, and monitoring peak flows. The patient should also continue taking Mesalamine for UC, fluoxetine, and aripiprazole for depression with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of asthma, depression, and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) admitted for an asthma exacerbation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slight elevation in heart rate. She is receiving CPAP and provigil for SDB, inhalers for asthma, and medication for depression and hypertension. Her labs show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but elevated levels of glucose and slightly low potassium. The patient has shown improvement in respiratory status, and the plan is to continue current treatments, taper steroids, and transfer her to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient was admitted for an asthma exacerbation, which is currently improving. However, there is still a risk of further worsening, and careful monitoring and management of her respiratory status should continue.
2. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
3. Hospital-acquired infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate infection control measures and surveillance should be implemented.
4. Glycemic control: The patient has elevated glucose levels, which should be monitored and managed with regular insulin sliding scale as per the plan.

","The patient is a 50-year-old female with status asthmaticus. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on several medications including inhalers, nebs every 4 hours, steroids, and CPAP. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/77-168/122 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, overweight, and no signs of pallor, edema, or abnormal pupillary reactions. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, no murmurs, and regular pulse. Respiratory examination reveals expiratory wheezes but fair air movement. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination is normal with attentive behavior, oriented, purposeful movements, and normal tone.

Lab results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels. However, glucose levels are elevated, ranging from 144 to 194 mg/dL. 

The patient's plan includes continuing inhalers/asthma regimen, nebs every 4 hours, changing steroids to 60mg daily and tapering, continuing CPAP/provigil"
