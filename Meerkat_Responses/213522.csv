","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, intermittent dyspnea, pleural effusion due to B-cell lymphoma, and a thickened posterior wall of the stomach requiring biopsy. The patient experienced asystole for 13 seconds yesterday but improved without medication. A pacemaker is being placed today. Thoracentesis was performed for malignant recurrent left-sided pleural effusion. The patient has a history of hypertension, hypercalcemia, and chronic kidney disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent episodes of asystole indicate a potential risk for further cardiac dysrhythmias.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory support with a nasal cannula and the presence of pleural effusion may lead to hypoxemia.
3. Malignant pleural effusion: The recurrent nature of the effusion suggests ongoing complications related to the patient's lymphoma.
4. Hypercalcemia: The elevated calcium levels may contribute to various complications such as renal dysfunction, bone demineralization, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's baseline CKD may be exacerbated by factors like hypercalcemia, hypotension, and dehydration.
6. Paced rhythm disturbances: After the pacemaker placement, there is a risk of developing paced rhythm disturbances.
7. Thromboembolic events: Given"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo woman admitted with h/o AFib/RVR, mod AS, mod MS, currently
   undergoing work-up of newly diagnosed lymphoma transferred to the CCU
   in the setting of hypotension and AFib/RVR s/p PPM placement for
   bradycardic pauses, with known recurrent L malignant pleural effusion
   and small pericardial effusion.
   .
   Hypotension: Suspect most likely secondary to AF/RVR in setting of
   valvular disease, although she was tachycardic for several hours before
   developing hypotension. Bedside echo prior to transfer not suggestive
   of tamponade physiology. Ddx would also include infectious process;
   obstruction much less likely.
   -attempt to control ventricular rate with IV metoprolol; could consider
   DC cardioversion if patient remains unstable

   RHYTHM: Tachy-brady syndrome with Afib/RVR with symptomatic pause of 12
   seconds, now s/p PPM placement and in Afib/RVR. Her nodal agents had
   been held yesterday due to sinus pauses, which may have contributed to
   her reversion into AF. Given that hypoTN is likely related to
   tachycardia, rate control is primary goal.

   # Respiratory Status: Currently improved and satting well on 3L NC from
   MICU. The patient has moderate AS, moderate MS related to MAC and
   diastolic CHF, preserved EF as well as atrial fibrillation and a L
   malignant pleural effusion so previous hypoxia was felt to be
   multifactorial. No evidence of PE on CTA. Patient was diuresed
   overnight 1 L in MICU with IV Lasix
   -Currently RR stable on 3L
   -Monitior I/Os
   -Hold on further diuresis as pt appears euvolemic on exam
   patient requiring frequent thoracentesis, may need pleurex catheter, IP
   ([**Doctor Last Name 3132**]) is aware of patient and when otherwise stable may be a
   candidate for this for symptomatic relief; however this depends on type
   of lymphoma and treatment (as effusion may improve w/treatment of
   lymphoma)

","The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted with a history of atrial fibrillation, moderate aortic stenosis, and moderate mitral stenosis. She is undergoing a work-up for newly diagnosed lymphoma and was transferred to the CCU in the setting of hypotension and atrial fibrillation after pacemaker placement for bradycardic pauses. The patient also has a small pericardial effusion and a recurrent malignant pleural effusion.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 96/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Physical examination findings include no acute distress, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normal heart sounds with a systolic and diastolic murmur, diminished radial and dorsalis pulses on the right side, and diminished dorsalis pulses on the left side. Crackles and wheezes are heard in the respiratory chest examination, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender. Neurologic examination reveals attentive and oriented behavior, but movement, tone, and skin assessment are not evaluated.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, glucose of 97 mg/dL, sodium of 28 mEq/L, potassium of 2.0 mg/dL, chloride of 101 mEq/L, magnesium of 141 mEq/L, and a platelet count of 285 K/uL. Other lab values include a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, INR of 1.1, calcium of 9.5 mg/dL, and phosphate of 4.6 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment includes hypotension likely secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, particularly in the setting of valvular disease. Infectious process, obstruction, and tamponade physiology are considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient has been started on intravenous metoprolol for rate control, and DC cardioversion may be considered if the patient remains unstable. A bedside echo has been performed, and further monitoring for signs of tamponade is recommended.

Other concerns include the patient's tachy-brady syndrome, lymphoma work-up, potential placement of a pleurex catheter for malignant pleural effusion, evaluation for posterior wall gastric thickening, and follow-up of bone marrow biopsy results. The patient"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided progress note. However, there are several significant findings and medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. The patient has an echocardiogram showing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a small left ventricular cavity, and almost complete obliteration in mid-systole. This indicates a possible underlying cardiac condition.

2. The patient also has aortic stenosis (AS) with a peak aortic gradient of 43 and a mean gradient of 21. This suggests narrowing of the aortic valve, which can cause problems with blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body.

3. The patient is currently on amiodarone for cardiac rhythm management, as they have atrial fibrillation (AFib). Amiodarone is used to control heart rate and prevent blood clots.

4. The patient recently had a pacemaker inserted, as evidenced by the mention of vancomycin being given for potential pacemaker infection. It is important to monitor the patient's pacemaker function and check for any complications related to the device.

5. The patient has an ongoing pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space around the lungs. This may require further investigation and management to prevent respiratory complications.

6. The patient has a broad differential diagnosis for an oncologic condition, with plans for further tissue biopsies. This suggests the possibility of malignancy or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, moderate aortic stenosis, and moderate mitral stenosis. She underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker (PPM) for bradycardic pauses and is currently being evaluated for newly diagnosed lymphoma. The patient has a recurrent malignant pleural effusion and a small pericardial effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. LVOT obstruction: The patient's left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) is obstructed due to a very small left ventricle. This can lead to decreased blood flow from the left ventricle to the rest of the body.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be related to the LVOT obstruction and other underlying conditions.
3. Tachy-brady syndrome: The patient has a tachy-brady syndrome, characterized by alternating rapid and slow heart rates. This can be a result of atrial fibrillation and the presence of a PPM.
4. Coronary artery disease: Although the patient does not have known coronary artery disease, it is likely given her peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
5. Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status remains stable but she will likely require repeat pleurodesis due to rapid re-accumulation of pleural effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, moderate aortic stenosis, and mitral stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent pacemaker placement for bradycardic pauses and has a known recurrent malignant pleural effusion and small pericardial effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains stable after receiving intravenous fluids. LVOT obstruction due to a very small left ventricle is noted on the echo, which could be related to the hypotension. The patient will be closely monitored.
2. Rhythm: The patient has tachy-brady syndrome with atrial fibrillation/rate-responsive pacing, now post pacemaker placement and still in atrial fibrillation/rate-responsive pacing. The plan is to maintain sinus rhythm with amiodarone, start low-dose beta-blockers, continue post-pacer antibiotics, and discuss anticoagulation with the electrophysiologist.
3. Coronaries: No known coronary disease, but likely given peripheral vascular disease. The patient will continue with aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins. No ACE inhibitors are given in the setting of hypoTN.
4. Respiratory Status: The patient's respiratory status remains stable. She will likely require a repeat large-b"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted with a history of atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, moderate aortic stenosis, and moderate mitral stenosis. She is undergoing a work-up for newly diagnosed lymphoma and has been transferred to the CCU in the setting of hypotension and atrial fibrillation/rate-responsive pacing (RVR) after pacemaker placement for bradycardic pauses. She also has a known recurrent malignant pleural effusion and a small pericardial effusion.

24-hour events:
- An echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of over 75% with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient greater than 30 [12-29] almost complete obliteration in mid-systole. The patient also has left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and a small LV cavity. Aortic valve peak aortic gradient (AS peak) is 43 (mean 21), and moderate functional mitral stenosis with mitral valve area (MVA) of 1.0-1.5 with a mean gradient of 9.
- The patient received 1 liter of intravenous fluid (IVF).
- Amiodarone load plus gentamicin (gatt) were given.
- Holding beta-blockers (BB) for 24 hours while amiodarone is on, will start in the morning"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted with a history of atrial fibrillation/rate-responsive ventricular rhythm (AFib/RVR), moderate aortic stenosis (AS), and moderate mitral stenosis (MS). She underwent work-up for newly diagnosed lymphoma and was transferred to the CCU in the setting of hypotension and AFib/RVR after pacemaker placement for bradycardic pauses. The patient also has known recurrent malignant pleural effusion and a small pericardial effusion.

The patient's current conditions include hypotension, tachy-brady syndrome with AFib/RVR, LVOT obstruction on ECHO due to a very small LV, trivial pericardial effusion, and a history of coronary artery disease with likely peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She is currently undergoing treatment with amiodarone for rhythm control, hydration, and monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures have remained nearly stable, but there is an ongoing concern about maintaining adequate blood flow to vital organs.

2. Rhythm control: The patient is being treated with amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm. However, she remains in AFib/RVR despite pacemaker placement.

3. LVOT obstruction: The patient has a small left ventricle (LV) leading to LVOT obstruction. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo woman admitted with h/o AFib/RVR, mod AS, mod MS, currently
   undergoing work-up of newly diagnosed lymphoma transferred to the CCU
   in the setting of hypotension and AFib/RVR s/p PPM placement for
   bradycardic pauses, with known recurrent L malignant pleural effusion
   and small pericardial effusion.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pressures have remained nearly stable. Notably pt found
   to have LVOT obstruction on ECHO appears related to very small LV.
   Patient given 1L NS yesterday to improve outflow tract dynamics. On
   trivial pericardial effusion noted on ECHO.
   - trying to maintain sinus rhythm with amio
   - keep hydrated
   - cont to monitor
   .
   #. RHYTHM: Tachy-brady syndrome with Afib/RVR, now s/p PPM placement
   and in Afib/RVR.
   - completed amio load. cont amio at 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] x1 week, and then 200mg
   [**Hospital1 7**] x 1 week and then 200 daily thereafter
   - start low dose BB today
   - cont post-pacer ABX
   -Discuss anti-coagulation with EP given need for coumadin however
   future procedures while in house unclear so will discuss w/all teams.
   .
   #. CORONARIES: No known coronary dz, but likely given PVD.
   -cont ASA, bb, statin
   -no ACE in setting of hypoTN
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Remains stable. Will likely require repeat L
   [**Female First Name (un) 217**] versus pleurX cath given rapid re-accumulation. Team has been in
   touch with IP.
   -Currently RR stable on 3L
   -Monitior I/Os
   -Hold on further diuresis as pt appears euvolemic on exam
    .
   # Lymphoma: Onc planning on gastric biopsy versus pleural nodule biopsy
   given dx not clear at this time..
   -f/u onc recs
   -when stabilized will need EGD to pursue posterior wall gastric
   thickening
   -f/u GI recs
   -f/u bone marrow biopsy results
   -Also previously hypercalcemic- continue lasix prn for diuresis, PTH 10
   (low) which is appropriate, phos normal- Pt has received pamidronate
   30mg IV x 1 on [**5-11**], okay to repeat in 1 week if necessary, monitor
   calcium daily
   .
   # CKD with baseline Cr 1.6-1.9 - currently 2.0.
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   -trend
   .
   # Aortic dissection: Felt to be a chronic finding. the patient has a
   non contrast CT of the chest with mural thrombus (asymptomatic) and
   ""potential area of small dissection"" in the aortic arch.
   -Cardiac surgery evaluated patient  and per their recs they felt no
   need for further imaging
   .
   # PVD:
   - continue statin and ASA
   .
   # Anemia: Mild, normocytic with normal RDW. Phlebotomy likely
   contributing.
   -Fe studies
   -trend
   .
   # FEN: heart healthy diet
   # Access: midline on left and PIV on right
   # PPx: PPI, heparin SC
   # Code: FULL (confirmed with patient)
   # Comm: daughter [**Name (NI) **] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8238**]
   # Dispo: call out to floor team- [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted with a history of atrial fibrillation/rhythm control, moderate aortic stenosis, and mitral stenosis.
- She underwent work-up for newly diagnosed lymphoma and was transferred to the CCU due to hypotension and atrial fibrillation/rhythm control post pacemaker placement.
- She has a known recurrent malignant pleural effusion and small pericardial effusion.
- The patient has been given intravenous fluids to improve outflow tract dynamics, and her pericardial effusion is being closely monitored.
- She is currently in atrial fibrillation/rhythm control and has a pacemaker in place.
- The plan is to maintain sinus rhythm with amiodarone, keep her hydrated, and continue monitoring.
- Her blood pressures have remained nearly stable, and the LVOT obstruction on ECHO appears related to her small left ventricle.
- She has a history of coronary artery disease but no known coronary disease.
- Her respiratory status remains stable, and she will likely require a repeat large-bore needle versus pleurX catheter due to rapid re-accumulation of the pleural effusion.
- Oncology planning includes gastric biopsy versus pleural nodule biopsy given the unclear diagnosis at this time.
- The patient has chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine 1.6-1.9, currently at 2.0.
- There is a"
