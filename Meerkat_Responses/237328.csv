   46M with DMI and metastatic NSCLC admitted with AMS, found to have DKA
   .
   #. Altered mental status:  Likely related to DKA as hyperosmolar state
   will cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for metastatic disease
   to brain. Unable to do full neuro exam given mental status changes.
   Infection also possibility.
   - Treat DKA as below
   - Continue to assess mental status
   .
   #. Diabetic ketoacidosis:  Hyperglycemia, acidosis, large anion gap,
   and ketonuria. Patient also with large osmolar gap. Preceded by not
   taking insulin x3 days. With partial respiratory compensation.
   - Hydrate patient aggressively. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 294**] protocol, initially with NS,
   then 1/2NS, then D5 1/2NS when glucose<250.
   - Insulin gtt. Once blood glucose <250, will start D5 1/2 NS. Once gap
   closed and patient is able to tolerate POs, will bridge to subcutaneous
   insulin.
   - Q1 hour blood glucose monitoring
   - Notify [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   - Aggressive electrolyte monitoring, particularly potassium (below),
   sodium
   - Antiemetics
   .
   #. Coffee-ground emesis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related retching ([**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear).
   Also possibility for ulceration given chemotherapy, radiation therapy.
   - GI consult
   - Type and screen
   - Repeat hematocrit Q6 hours until stable
   - PPI IV
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia:  Serum potassium elevated on admission although likely
   total body potassium depleted given hyperglycemic diuresis. Acidosis
   causes extracellular shift of potassium. Acute renal failure also
   likely a contributor. EKG with peaked T waves in ED. Expect potassium
   to come down with correction of hyperglycemia.
   - Careful monitoring of electrolytes (Q2 hours)
   - Aggressive potassium repletion (with recognition of renal failure)
   once glucose begins to normalize secondary to intracellular shift and
   overall total body potassium depletion
   .
   #. Hyperosmolar gap:  Larger than expected with DKA, although possible
   given that measured Na is underestimated in setting of such high
   hyperglycemia. No known toxin intoxication.
   - Send off screen for ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol
   - Recheck serum osm once hyperglycemia improves
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline creatinine 0.8. Currently creatinine
   1.9. Given large volume diuresis associated with DKA, most likely
   prerenal etiology. ATN also possibility. ?renal toxicity from recently
   started chemotherapeutic agents.
   - Continue hydration, as above
   - Urine lytes
   .
   #. Right pleural effusion:  Known malignant pleural effusion. Will
   watch for indication of post-obstructive pneumonia. Afebrile and
   without leukocytosis, although does have left-shift.
   .
   #. NSLC:  s/p XRT. Cycle 1 of gemcitibane, carboplatin started [**2176-8-6**].
   - Notify oncologist of admission
   - Continue morphine SR per outpatient regimen, with hold parameters
   .
   #. Bipolar disorder:
   - Continue Depakote, quietiapine, and venlafaxine per home regimen
   .
   #. Hypertension:  Not on medication therapy.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia:  Not on medication therapy.
   .
   FEN:  Liquid diet given nausea, advance as tolerated; aggressive fluid
   resuscitation, as above
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots and heparin SC TID (double coverage given
   malignancy), PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen standing and as needed
   Access:  PIV, right femoral CVL (will need to replace given infection
   risk)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DMI) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and found to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues, including infection, hyperkalemia, hyperosmolar gap, acute renal failure, right pleural effusion, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to DKA, but other possibilities include metastatic disease to the brain and infection.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient has hyperglycemia, acidosis, a large anion gap, and ketonuria. Aggressive hydration and insulin therapy are required to correct the condition.
3. Coffee-Ground Emesis: The presence of coffee-ground emesis may be due to retching or gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly related to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. A GI consult has been ordered.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated serum potassium levels, which may be due to hyperglycemic diuresis, acidosis causing an extracellular shift of potassium, or acute renal failure. Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary, along with aggressive potassium repletion once glucose begins to normalize.
5. Hyperosmolar Gap: The patient has a larger-than-expected hyperos"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetic mellitus (DMI) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient also has hypokalemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, right pleural effusion, bipolar disorder, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently intubated, sedated, and receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's AMS and fever may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen if not properly managed.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various factors such as DKA, metastatic disease to the brain, or an infection. Weaning off sedation and further neurological evaluation are necessary.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or renal toxicity from chemotherapeutic agents. Close monitoring of renal parameters and fluid balance is essential.
4. Pleural effusion: The known malignant pleural effusion may lead to post-obstructive pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection and pneumonia is important.
5. Metastatic disease progression: Given the patient's history of NSCLC, there is a risk of further disease progression and potential complications related to metastases"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and intubated for airway protection due to coffee ground emesis. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and malignancy (lung cancer).

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's osmolal gap closed, and the anion gap also closed. The patient continues to receive assisted mechanical ventilation and is being given D5 (5% dextrose) in water with potassium at a rate of 250 mEq/day. Blood cultures were taken on multiple occasions.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106 to 155/80-93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is agitated and not following commands, with no abnormalities in his pupils, heart rhythm being sinus rhythm, and lungs showing bilateral rhonchi anteriorly.

The patient has received various medications, including fentanyl, insulin, propofol, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium. His fluid balance indicates an intake of 4,475 mL and output of 2,950 mL, with a total fluid deficit of 1,525 mL"

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and intubated for airway protection in the setting of coffee ground emesis. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and malignancy. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including delirium, hypernatremia, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Summary of Progress:
- The patient's Osmolar gap has closed.
- Acid-Base (AG) has also closed.
- The patient is currently on assisted ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSI) of 7.
- Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating but are now under control with insulin infusions.
- The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hypernatremia and hyperkalemia, are being addressed with appropriate replacements and monitoring.
- The patient's renal function has improved with volume repletion.
- There is ongoing concern for UGIB, possibly due to a Mallory-Weiss tear.
- The patient's fever of 100.5 could indicate an infection or possibly acute DKA.
- The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.
- The patient's platelet count is low, and his white blood cell count is slightly elevated.
- His liver function tests"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
- He presented to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and was intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
- The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including delirium, hypernatremia, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.
- He is currently receiving insulin through a gtt to manage his blood glucose levels and is being closely monitored for any changes in his condition.
- The patient's pleural effusion is attributed to his malignancy, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his UGIB.
- The patient's respiratory failure was managed with mechanical ventilation, and his renal function has improved with volume repletion.
- The patient's current medications include fentanyl, regular insulin, heparin sodium, and propofol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is likely due to hypernatremia and recent hyperosmolar state. It is important to continue monitoring his mental status and re-evaluate when electrolyte imbalances are corrected.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia secondary to hyperosmolar diuresis. Close monitoring of his sodium levels is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who was admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He is intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's condition has been complicated by hypernatremia, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and potential encephalitis. He is currently receiving insulin, D5, and other medications to manage his DKA and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated for airway protection, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should implement the VAP bundle to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and ICU stay increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as pneumatic compression devices should be utilized to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to the critical illness and UGIB. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) should be continued to prevent stress ulcers.
4. Feeding tube-associated complications: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and may require enteral nutrition. Close monitoring for any complications associated with feeding tubes, such as aspiration pneumonia or tube displacement, is necessary"

   Assessment and Plan
   46M with DMI and metastatic NSCLC admitted with AMS, found to have DKA
   .
   #. Altered mental status:  Likely related to DKA as hyperosmolar state
   can cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for metastatic disease
   to brain. Unable to do full neuro exam given mental status changes.
   Infection also possibility.
   - Treat DKA as below
   - Continue to assess mental status with sedation weaning
   - Consider LP if worsening fever and no improvement
   .
   #. Diabetic ketoacidosis:  Anion and osmolar gap now closed.  Receiving
   D5 1/2NS with KCl at 250cc/hr and still on insulin drip.
   - Once patient is able to tolerate POs, will bridge to subcutaneous
   insulin.
   - Q4 hour blood glucose monitoring
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following
   - Aggressive electrolyte monitoring, particularly potassium (below),
   sodium
   - Antiemetics
   .
   #. Hypokalemia:  Serum potassium now low reflecting low total body
   potassium depleted given hyperglycemic diuresis and intracellular shift
   now that acidosis is correcting.
   - Careful monitoring of electrolytes (Q6 hours)
   - Aggressive potassium repletion with goal K>4.5
   .
   #. Hypernatremia:  In setting of hyperosmolar gap on admission with
   free water deficit.  Will calculate free water deficit and replace with
   D5W (separate from the 1/2NS with KCl).
   # Hyperosmolar gap: Likely secondary to DKA as gap closed with anion
   gap closing and no calcium oxalate crystals seen on urine exam.
   Continuing to empirically treat for possible ethylene glycol intox with
   fomepizole until serum level comes back as negative.
   - f/u  methanol (alcohol profile), ethylene glycol
   .
   #. Coffee-ground emesis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related retching ([**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear).
   Also possibility for ulceration given chemotherapy, radiation therapy.
   - GI consulted and does not recommend EGD as likely was M-W tear
   - Type and screen active
   - Repeat hematocrit Q6 hours until stable
   - Will change PPI IV drip to PPI IV BID
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Resolved.  Baseline creatinine 0.8 with
   creatinine 1.9 on admission. Given large volume diuresis associated
   with DKA and response to IVFs likely prerenal etiology. ATN also
   possibility. ?renal toxicity from recently started chemotherapeutic
   agents.
   - Continue hydration, as above
   .
   #. Right pleural effusion:  Known malignant pleural effusion. Will
   watch for indication of post-obstructive pneumonia. Afebrile and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetic mellitus and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and found to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient received aggressive fluid resuscitation and treatment for DKA, which included insulin drip, potassium repletion, and careful monitoring of electrolytes. 

Other medical complications include hypokalemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, coffee-ground emesis, and right pleural effusion. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, and he is currently receiving hydration as per previous treatment plan. The pleural effusion is known to be malignant and will be monitored for signs of post-obstructive pneumonia. 

The patient is also experiencing coffee-ground emesis, which could be related to retching or ulceration due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A gastrointestinal consultation does not recommend an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at this time. 

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, but is currently not on medication therapy for these conditions. 

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, insulin, and propofol drips for pain control and sedation. 

Discharge planning includes ongoing ICU care, close monitoring of glycemic control, and continued treatment for the patient's medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetic mellitus and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with altered mental status and found to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He also has a known malignant pleural effusion on the right side and is undergoing chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin. The patient's past medical history includes bipolar disorder, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently experiencing several medical complications including hypokalemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and a possible ethylene glycol intoxication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for a right lung collapse seen on the chest X-ray and failed respiratory system readiness assessment (RSBI) this morning. A bronchoscopy has been planned to further evaluate the situation, and the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia is being considered.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely related to DKA, but there is also a concern for metastatic disease to the brain. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, is another possibility. The patient's white blood cell count has been trending downward, which argues against an infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetic mellitus and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated to protect his airway, and his lung collapse seen on chest X-ray is suspected to be caused by a malignant pleural effusion. There are several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the combination of his underlying lung cancer and the recent lung collapse. Immediate plans include performing a bronchoscopic procedure to investigate the cause further and consider possible interventions such as [Female First Name (un) 231]. Differential diagnoses include infected effusion, post-obstructive pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) on admission, hyperosmolar state causing contraction of neurons, or metastatic disease to the brain. Other possibilities include infection (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis), but the decreasing WBC count argues against this. The patient followed commands during a sedation holiday yesterday, suggesting some level of awareness.

3. Right Pleural Effusion: The patient has a known malignant pleural effusion. There is a concern for post-obstructive pneumonia, and further investigation is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who presented with respiratory failure and is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He also has a large right pleural effusion, which is causing respiratory compromise. The patient's condition is complicated by delirium, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation suggests a continued need for respiratory support. Multifactorial causes such as right lung collapse/atalectasis, development of endobronchial lesion, progressive right pleural effusion, evolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and large right pleural effusion contribute to the respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Monitoring for signs of infection and implementing appropriate measures to prevent and treat VAP is crucial.
3. Delirium: The patient initially had delirium, which contributed to the toxic/metabolic etiology (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state). Limiting medications and considering a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out encephalitis if the patient develops fever are important considerations.

   Assessment and Plan
   46M w/ Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, a/w DKA, c/b UGIB.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- initially intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with evidence for continued dependence for mechanical ventilation.
   Suspect multifactorial, including Right lung collapse/atalectasis,
   development of endobronchial lesion, progressive right pleural effusion
   (in context of volume expansion), evolving VAP, on background of large
   right pleural effusion.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Monitor
   for evidence for VAP.  Plan bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   Large volume thoracentesis may not be possible, but will check with IP
   service to assess success in recent pass.
   DELERIUM -- initally contributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state).  Prior MRI w/o evidence of mets.
   Limit medications.  If develops fever (101) may need LP to r/o
   encephalitis.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Continue replete free water to maintain Na WNL.
   Monitor Na.
   DKA
 Likely [**1-29**] med non-compliance (no insulin x 3d).  AG now
   closed.   Continued on insulin gtt, plan to transition when able to
   tolerate p.o./no longer requiring mechanical ventilation.   Continued
   on D5
 NS w/ K @ 250.  Monitor q6H
   OSMOLAR GAP -- Osmolar gap- now closed, d/c fomepizole until ethylene
   glycol neg.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF
   NSCLC, stage IV- Lg R pleural effusion.  Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.
   Fever- 100.5, possibly [**1-29**] acute DKA, but concern for infection
   (including empyema, evolving VAP) or tumor (lung CA).

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and he remains intubated due to dependence on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's history is significant for right lung collapse/atalectasis, development of an endobronchial lesion, progressive right pleural effusion (in the context of volume expansion), evolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a recent episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has also been diagnosed with hypernatremia, delirium, acute renal failure, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

The patient's current medications include insulin gtt, D5 NS w/ KCl, pantoprazole (Protonix), and fomepizole (for ethylene glycol poisoning). He is also receiving nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TF).

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient is suspected to have multifactorial respiratory failure, including right lung collapse/atalectasis, development of an endobronchial lesion, progressive right pleural effusion, evolving VAP, and large right pleural effusion. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor for evidence of VAP. A bronchoscopy will be performed to assess airway patency, and a large volume thoracentesis may"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of DMI (depressive mood disorder) and metastatic NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) admitted to the ICU for AMS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient presented with DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) and required intubation to protect the airway due to agitation and vomiting. 

The patient has a known malignant pleural effusion, which is causing right lung collapse. The cause of the collapse is suspected to be post-obstructive pneumonia, infected effusion, aspiration pneumonia, or VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia). A bronchoscopy has been planned to investigate further. 

The patient also has altered mental status, likely related to DKA or metastatic disease to the brain. There is a concern for infection such as VAP, aspiration pneumonia, or encephalitis. The patient's WBC count is decreasing without antibiotic use, making infection less likely. 

Other medical conditions include right pleural effusion (known malignant effusion), coffee-ground emesis (possibly related to retching or ulceration), thrombocytopenia (platelet count decreasing since admission), hypernatremia (resolved), hypokalemia (resolved), hyperosmolar gap (resolved), and acute renal failure (resolved).

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. 

The patient's current medications include pantop"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of DMI and metastatic NSCLC admitted with AMS and found to have DKA. He is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and has a right lung collapse seen on CXR. The differential includes infection (infected effusion, post-obstructive pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, VAP) or failing RSBI. Plan to evaluate the lungs with a CT chest today and consider extubation later today. Other issues include altered mental status possibly related to DKA or metastatic disease to the brain, right pleural effusion (known malignant pleural effusion), coffee-ground emesis, thrombocytopenia likely medication-related, and diabetic ketoacidosis resolved. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated to protect the airway, and there is a concern for worsening respiratory failure due to the collapsed right lung. Further evaluation with a CT chest will provide more information.
2. Infection: There is a concern for various infections such as infected pleural effusion, post-obstructive pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be important.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status changes may be due to several factors including DKA, metastatic disease to the brain, or infection. Trending WBC count, adding on diff"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diffuse midline glioma (DMI) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with altered mental status and found to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and agitation. He has a known right malignant pleural effusion from NSCLC. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including hypokalemia, hypernatremia, hyperosmolar gap, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and DKA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of the right lung collapse seen on chest X-ray and failed respiratory system assessment with bronchoscopy planned today.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be related to DKA, hyperosmolar state causing contraction of neurons, metastatic disease to the brain, or infection (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis).
3. Right Pleural Effusion: The patient has a known malignant pleural effusion, which could lead to post-obstructive pneumonia. Bronchoscopy is planned to further evaluate the condition.
4. Coffee-Ground Emesis: The patient's coffee-ground emesis could be related to retching or ulceration due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
5. Thrombocytopenia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with respiratory failure. He has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to airway protection. The patient's current condition includes progressive right atelectasis and respiratory failure. There are concerns for multifactorial causes such as right lung collapse/atalectasis, progressive right pleural effusion, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has delirium, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and a suspicion of acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation suggests ongoing respiratory failure. This may be due to right lung collapse/atalectasis, pleural effusion, or VAP.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's clinical presentation raises concerns for evolving VAP, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has resolved hypernatremia but requires close monitoring of sodium levels.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient showed improvement in renal function after volume repletion. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
5. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): There is a clinical concern for UGIB, possibly related to medication use."

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with respiratory failure. He was intubated for airway protection and is currently mechanically ventilated due to progressive right atelectasis and respiratory failure. The possible causes of respiratory failure include right lung collapse/atalectasis, progressive right pleural effusion, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor for evidence of VAP. A chest CT scan will be done to evaluate the right thorax anatomy.

The patient also has delirium, which initially contributed to a toxic/metabolic etiology (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state). His usual psych medications should be resumed, and if he develops a fever, a lumbar puncture may be necessary to rule out encephalitis.

The patient has resolved hypernatremia and acute renal failure. He is on insulin gtt to manage his blood sugar levels and will transition to oral intake when no longer requiring mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving D5 NS w/ K @ 250 q6H.

There is a concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), possibly related to chemotherapy, and the patient is being transitioned to IV PPI. A gastrointestinal consultation is pending.

The patient's nutritional support will be initiated through tube feeding (TF).

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- initially intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with evidence for continued dependence for mechanical ventilation.
   Suspect multifactorial, including Right lung collapse/atalectasis,
   perhaps progressive right pleural effusion (in context of volume
   expansion), evolving VAP.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.
   Monitor for evidence for VAP.  Chest CT to evaluate right thorax
   anatomy.
   DELERIUM -- initally contributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state).  Prior MRI w/o evidence of mets.
   Limit medications.  Resume usual psych medications.  If develops fever
   (101) may need LP to r/o encephalitis.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Resolved.  Monitor Na.
   DKA
 Likely [**1-29**] med non-compliance (no insulin x 3d).  AG now
   closed.   Continued on insulin gtt, plan to transition when able to
   tolerate p.o./no longer requiring mechanical ventilation.   Continued
   on D5
 NS w/ K @ 250.  Monitor q6H
   OSMOLAR GAP -- Osmolar gap- now closed, d/c fomepizole until ethylene
   glycol neg.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.  Monitor
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   NSCLC, stage IV- Right pleural effusion, now with right lung
   atalectasis due to extrinsic compression.   Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.
   Fever- 100.5, possibly [**1-29**] acute DKA, but concern for infection
   (including empyema, evolving VAP) or tumor (lung CA).

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient had bronchoscopy results showing extrinsic compression of the right lower lobe subsegmental bronchi and a small sessile lesion in the right basilar subsegment, which is suspicious for tumor. Thoracic ultrasound demonstrated limited fluid, and a plan for a chest CT scan has been made.

The patient has a history of diabetes, as indicated by hyperglycemia and the need for insulin therapy. He also has hypernatremia, which has since resolved. There is a concern for delirium, possibly contributing to the toxic/metabolic etiology. An MRI was performed without evidence of metastasis. The patient may need a lumbar puncture (LP) if he develops fever to rule out encephalitis.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with progressive right atelectasis and respiratory failure. Multifactorial causes such as right lung collapse/atalectasis, pleural effusion, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are suspected. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor for evidence of VAP. A chest CT will be performed to evaluate the right thorax anatomy.

The patient is also at risk for acute renal failure, which has improved with volume repletion. Nutritional support has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   46M with DMI and metastatic NSCLC admitted with AMS, found to have DKA
   .
   #. Altered mental status:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been related to DKA on admission as
   hyperosmolar state can cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for
   metastatic disease to brain although had MRI in [**Month (only) 93**] without brain mets
   and non-contrast head CT yesterday without signs of bleed. Infection
   (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis) is also a possibility
   although decreasing WBC count without abx agrues against this. Other
   underlying issue is his bipolar disorder.  Just restarted his seroquel
   and depakote yesterday now that he is taking POs.  Plan to restart
   venlafaxine today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with altered mental status, which was initially thought to be due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, further evaluation revealed a pulmonary thrombus and a large mass in the right lower lobe of the lung. The patient also has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently on several medications for psychiatric conditions, including Seroquel, Depakote, and venlafaxine.

The patient's current status shows improvement in his respiratory failure, as he has been extubated and is maintaining good oxygen saturation on a nasal cannula. However, he continues to experience tachycardia, likely related to the pulmonary thrombus. His thrombocytopenia has worsened, and he is on a prophylactic PPI due to a recent chemotherapy treatment.

The patient's DKA has resolved, and he is receiving D5NS at 150cc/hr and an insulin drip. He is now tolerating oral intake, so it is planned to transition him to subcutaneous insulin today. His anemia requires further evaluation, and an active type and screen has been ordered.

The patient has a known malignant pleural effusion, which will be monitored for signs of post-obstructive pneumonia. He is also at risk for developing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and efforts are"

   Assessment and Plan
   46M with DMI and metastatic NSCLC admitted with AMS, found to have DKA
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated to protect airway [**1-29**] agitation and
   vomiting.  R lung collapse seen on CXR and failed RSBI yesterday
   (tachypnea to 40s) in setting of known R malignant pleural effusion
   from NSCLC.  Bronched yesterday with RLL orifices narrowed likely from
   extrinsic compression but no obvious secretions or mucous plugs.  IP
   called and found no pleural fluid to tap for [**Female First Name (un) 231**].  Question if this
   collapse was present on admission given similar CXR findings.
   Differential includes infection (infected effusion, post-obstructive
   pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, VAP) or failing RSBI [**1-29**] agitation.
   Plan to eval lungs with CT chest today and considering extubation to
   see how he does (assuming that his failing is RSBI is due to agitation
   causing tachypnea).
   -f/u CT chest
   - possible extubation later today
   .
   #. Altered mental status:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been related to DKA on admission as
   hyperosmolar state can cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for
   metastatic disease to brain although had MRI in [**Month (only) 93**] without brain
   mets. Infection (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis) is also a
   possibility although decreasing WBC count without abx agrues against
   this. Other underlying issue is his bipolar disorder (we have been
   holding his meds due to being NPO).  Unable to do full neuro exam given
   mental status changes but follows commands during sedation holiday
   yesterday.
   - trend WBC count, adding on diff to look for signs of infection
   - Continue to assess mental status with sedation weaning
   - Consider LP if worsening fever, WBC and no improvement
   - CT  head today to look for signs of bleeding (given thrombocytopenia)
   - restarting his depakote and seroquel, still holding venlafaxine
   - given Haldol for acute agitation during rounds
   .
   #. Right pleural effusion:  Known malignant pleural effusion. Will
   watch for indication of post-obstructive pneumonia.  Will have more
   information after chest CT.
   - f/u chest CT
   .
   #. Coffee-ground emesis:  No events since day of admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   related retching ([**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear). Also possibility for ulceration
   given chemotherapy, radiation therapy.
   - Type and screen active
   - trend daily hematocrit
   - continue PPI IV BID
   manage
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt count decreasing since admission.  This is
   likely medication related as he just received chemo on [**8-6**] and he is
   on a PPI.  Getting head CT today to eval for bleeding as cause of
   AMS/agitation.
   -trend plt count
   - plt goal > 20
   .
   #. Diabetic ketoacidosis: Resolved. Receiving D5NS at 75cc/hr and still
   on insulin drip.
   - start tube feeds after bronch and continue insulin drip
   - Once patient is able to tolerate POs, will bridge to subcutaneous
   insulin.
   - QID hour blood glucose monitoring
   -[**Last Name (un) 294**] recs: Continue IVF D5 NS; When ready to transition out of ICU
   and off drip, would start NPH 8U q8H and humalog sliding scale b**d on
   insulin needs once TF on board.
   - Antiemetics PRN
   .
   #. NSLC:  s/p XRT. Cycle 1 of gemcitibane, carboplatin started [**2176-8-6**].
   - on fentanyl and propofol drips for pain control and sedation
   - receiving palliative chemo per onc
   - pain for family meeting today to discuss prognosis
   .
   #. Bipolar disorder:
   - Restarting home Depakote, quietiapine
   - Still holding venlafaxine, likely to restart soon
   .
   #. Hypertension:  History of HTN but BPs controlled here and not on
   medication therapy at home.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia:  H/o of hyperlipidemia but not on medication
   therapy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DMI) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient was admitted with acute mental status changes (AMS) and found to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, altered mental status, right pleural effusion, coffee-ground emesis, thrombocytopenia, diabetic ketoacidosis (resolved), NSCLC, bipolar disorder, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other medical issues.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, likely caused by a combination of factors such as right lung collapse seen on chest X-ray, malignant pleural effusion from NSCLC, and possible aspiration pneumonia. The differential diagnosis includes infection (infected effusion, post-obstructive pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia) or failing respiratory support (RSBI) due to agitation. Further evaluation with a CT chest is planned, and the possibility of extubation is being considered.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is attributed to DKA on admission and potential metastatic disease to the brain. Other possible causes include infection (ventilator-associated pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis), underlying bipolar disorder (medication hold due to NPO status), and other"

   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state), and witholding of usual
   psychiatric medications.  Since extubation, now resuming usual PO
   meds.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), right pleural effusion, and recent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
- The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure caused by progressive right atelectasis.
- A computed tomography (CT) scan showed evidence of an acute pulmonary embolism (PE), for which the patient was started on low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed.
- The patient experienced delirium initially attributed to a toxic/metabolic etiology, but it has improved since extubation and resumption of usual psychiatric medications.
- The patient continues to have tachycardia, likely multifactorial in origin, including PE, hypovolemia, anxiety, and possible pericardial involvement by lung cancer.
- DKA has improved but the patient remains on an insulin drip and will transition to subcutaneous insulin.
- There is a concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from recent chemotherapy, and the patient is being transitioned to IV pantoprazole (Protonix) with a pending gastrointestinal consultation.
- Acute renal failure has improved with volume repletion and will be monitored with urine output and creatinine levels.
- Nutritional support will be initiated through tube feeding (TF).
- The patient has stage IV NSCL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by right lung atelectasis. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed evidence of a pulmonary embolism, for which the patient is being started on low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) and will have an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed. The patient was initially delirious, possibly due to hypernatremia and hyperosmolar state, but has since resumed usual psychiatric medications. Tachycardia is likely multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, hypovolemia, anxiety, and potential pericardial involvement by lung cancer. DKA has improved, but the patient remains on an insulin drip and will transition to subcutaneous insulin. There is a concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and a gastrointestinal consultation has been requested. Acute renal failure has improved with volume repletion, and nutrition support will be initiated through total parenteral nutrition (TF). The patient's schizophrenia requires a psychiatry consultation. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- stable s/p extubation.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- evidence for acute by CT scan.  Plan trial of
   lovenox and placement of IVC filter.  Check LE NIVS to assess for
   persistent source.
   DELIRIUM -- initally attributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state), and witholding of usual
   psychiatric medications.  Since extubation, now resuming usual PO
   meds.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   hypovolemia, anxiety.  Also consider pericardial involvement by lung
   cancer.
   DKA

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a diagnosis of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), right pleural effusion, and recent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's current health issues include respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, delirium, tachycardia, DKA, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), acute renal failure, nutritional support, schizophrenia, and right lung atelectasis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
- Heart rate: 121 bpm
- Blood pressure: 119/78 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient is currently extubated and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. He is also on an insulin drip for DKA, which has improved but still requires subcutaneous insulin. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while his creatinine and blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, good dentition, clear breath sounds bilaterally, and warm skin without rash or jaundice. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

The patient's medical history includes DKA, mild upper"

   46M with DMI and metastatic NSCLC admitted with AMS, found to have DKA,
   which has since resolved.
   .
   # Pulmonary thrombus: In situ R interlobar pulmonary thrombosis seen on
   CT.  Treated with lovenox but given thrombocytopenia and new hct drop,
   lovenox held. Hct stable. Pt received dose of lovenox yesterday. LENI
   demonstrate clot in legs.
   -IVC filter today
   -Hold lovenox for procedure today
   .
   #. Altered Mental status:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been related to DKA on admission as
   hyperosmolar state can cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for
   metastatic disease to brain although had MRI in [**Month (only) 93**] without brain mets
   and non-contrast head CT yesterday without signs of bleed. Infection
   (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis) is also a possibility
   although decreasing WBC count without abx agrues against this. Also
   consider his bipolar disorder. Restarted his seroquel, depakote , and
   venlafaxine.
   - continue depakote and seroquel and venlafaxine
   -add another [**Doctor Last Name 23**] back??
   - continue Haldol PRN

    #. Bipolar disorder: Now with command hallucinations and had suicidal
   ideation yesterday, but no plan. Psych consulted who recommended
   d/c
ing lorazepam and dronabinol.
   - Restarted Depakote, quietiapine, venlafaxine
   -start another med??
   - f/u psych recs

   # Tachycardia:  Likely related to his pulmonary thrombus but must also
   consider pain, hypovolemia, arrhythmia, and agitation/anxiety.  HR did

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, hypertension, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted with altered mental status, which resolved after treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis. He has since developed several complications including pulmonary thrombus, thrombocytopenia, right pleural effusion, tachycardia, and anemia. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, haloperidol, insulin sliding scale, fondaparinux (held today for IVC filter placement), and morphine for pain control and sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary thrombus: The patient has an in situ right interlobar pulmonary thrombosis seen on CT. This can lead to further complications such as pulmonary embolism or infarction if not managed appropriately.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing since admission. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Right pleural effusion: The patient has a known malignant pleural effusion. This can lead to respiratory distress and infection if not managed properly.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated and has not responded to fluid bolus, haloperidol, or morphine. This may be due to the pulmonary thrombus or other underlying causes.
5. Anemia: The patient is stable but with decreased"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and was found to have a pulmonary thrombus seen on CT. This indicates a possible PE, which can cause tachycardia and shortness of breath.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of occlusive thrombus within the left posterior tibial veins and nonocclusive thrombus mobile within the right common femoral vein, as seen on the lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI). This suggests a DVT, which increases the risk of PE if left untreated.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing since admission, indicating thrombocytopenia. This could be related to medication or chemotherapy.

4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although resolved, the patient was admitted with altered mental status related to DKA. This is a serious complication of diabetes that requires prompt treatment.

5. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be attributed to various factors such as DKA, infection, metastatic disease to the brain, or medication side effects.

6. Bipolar disorder: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently exhibiting command hallucinations and suicidal ideation. Psychiatric consultation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, hypertension, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted with altered mental status and was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis, which has since resolved. The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, tachycardia, and anemia. He is currently receiving palliative chemotherapy and has undergone an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of malignancy, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events. The presence of tachycardia and evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) suggest a possible PE.
2. DVT: The LENI findings indicate the presence of occlusive thrombus in the left posterior tibial veins and nonocclusive thrombus in the right common femoral vein.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing since admission, likely due to chemotherapy. This could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may be due to chronic disease, chemotherapy, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be related to his underlying medical"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions and complications. 

The patient has stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with right pleural effusion and is suspected to have right lung atelectasis due to extrinsic compression from the tumor. The patient recently experienced diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and mild upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

The patient also has delirium, which has improved since resuming usual oral medications. The delirium is being managed with haloperidol as needed. The patient has tachycardia, likely caused by a combination of factors including pulmonary embolism, hypovolemia, anxiety, and possible pericardial involvement by lung cancer. 

Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia, likely due to chemotherapy, and acute renal failure, which has improved with volume repletion. The patient requires nutritional support and is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF).

Other notable findings include evidence of a pulmonary embolism, with bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) detected in lower extremities, for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. The patient is also at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and stress ulcers.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems."

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- stable s/p extubation.  Monitor RR, SaO2.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- evidence for acute by CT scan.  LE NIVS
   demonstrate bilateral DVT.  s/p placement of IVC filter this AM, and
   continue anticoagulation.
   DELIRIUM -- Improved since resuming usual PO meds.  Use Haldol prn -->
   monitor ECG Qt.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   hypovolemia, anxiety.  Also consider pericardial involvement by lung
   cancer.
   DKA
 improved.  [**Last Name (un) 294**] Consultation recommendations in progress.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 likely attributable to chemotherapy.  Monitor plts
   count.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.  Monitor uo,
   creatinine.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   NSCLC, stage IV- Right pleural effusion, now with right lung
   atalectasis due to extrinsic compression.   Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.
   SCHIZOPHRENIA
 Psychiatry consult.  No need for 24-hr sitter.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who presented with respiratory distress. He has a history of right pleural effusion, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient is currently experiencing progressive right lung atelectasis and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, delirium, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 145/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows normal sinus tachycardia, and fluid balance indicates an intake of 4807 mL, output of 4590 mL, with a negative balance of 217 mL.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, normal cardiovascular examination, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds on the left, and right-sided crackles. The patient has trace edema in the lower extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.1 thousand/mm³, decreased hemoglobin at 8.5 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests"
