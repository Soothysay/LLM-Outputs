- The patient presented with pneumonia and sepsis, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia given the large infiltrate on chest X-ray.
- Blood cultures were positive for gram-negative rods (GNR).
- The patient is currently receiving vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and Flagyl.
- Pressors are being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
- The patient's respiratory status is failing, possibly due to pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.
- Metoprolol was given to control heart rate but resulted in hypotension, requiring more pressors.
- The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible demand ischemia due to sepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).
- The patient previously had an incarcerated hernia, which has now been reduced, but a new inguinal hernia has developed.
- There is evidence of small bowel obstruction (SBO) on CT scan.
- The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with an increase in creatinine from baseline.
- The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to sepsis, trauma, or ischemic stroke.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and a previous incarcerated hernia. He presented to the ICU with pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with an irregular heartbeat and a loud systolic murmur. He has cool extremities with 2+ pulses. Blood cultures indicate the presence of gram-negative rods (GNR), and sputum shows gram-positive cocci (GPC). The patient is receiving multiple IV medications, including pressors, antibiotics, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to pneumonia. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of clinical deterioration.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis. Ventilation settings should be optimized, and the patient should be closely monitored for any changes in oxygenation or ventilation.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient's AF with RVR may have been exacerbated by sepsis. Rate control measures should be continued, and underlying sepsis should be treated aggressively.

4. Elevated Troponin: Although the troponin levels are within normal limits, there are ST depressions in the EKG, indicating"

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and incarcerated hernia. He was found down and diagnosed with sepsis, pneumonia, small bowel obstruction, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving multiple pressor medications to maintain his blood pressure and has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for his sepsis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation has been poor, and he requires an increased FiO2 to maintain adequate oxygen levels. The underlying etiology is likely the progressive pneumonia.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's heart rate is in the 120s, and there are ST depressions on his ECG. Beta blockers are being held due to the requirement for pressor support for sepsis, although he is on Metoprolol 50mg at home.

3. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury. However, the CK-MB levels are normal, and it is unclear if this is symptomatic or not.

4. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has evidence of SBO on CT scan, and there is a history of previous incisional hernia. Surgery"

   Disposition: Pending plan from health-care proxy.  Currently plan is to
   not escalate care.  Patient requiring ICU level support for now.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and an incarcerated hernia. He is currently in the ICU for sepsis and pneumonia. The patient has several medical complications that need to be monitored and managed.

1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a history of an incarcerated hernia and recent imaging shows evidence of SBO. Surgery has been informed but the patient has refused surgery in the past and there are no plans for surgery even if the hernia worsens.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia appears to be worsening, as indicated by the progression on chest X-ray and the presence of GNR in the sputum and blood cultures. The source of infection is likely the pneumonia, and the patient is currently being treated with antibiotics.

3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis has not yet progressed to organ dysfunction. He is receiving aggressive treatment with multiple antibiotics and pressor support.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has stabilized at 2.0 from baseline 1.4-1.8, and his urine output has decreased to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with fluids. He is likely coping poorly with sepsis due to his critical aortic stenosis.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient is requiring increased FiO2 overnight, indicating poor"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a history of incarcerated hernia, which could lead to small bowel obstruction. This is supported by the presence of a CT scan showing evidence of SBO.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest widespread pneumonia in the left lung. The presence of GNR and GPC in the sputum gram stain indicates a bacterial infection, and the patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotics.

3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, as evidenced by fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and positive blood cultures. The source of infection is likely the pneumonia.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level and low urine output. This could be due to prerenal causes related to sepsis or acute tubular necrosis.

5. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. There are concerns about diastolic heart failure exacerbation due to fluid overload.

6. Myocardial Infarction: Elevated troponin levels suggest possible myocardial injury, but further evaluation is needed to confirm if it is symptomatic or due to demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis.

   Assessment and Plan
   76yoM h/o CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and incarcerated hernia
   for which he refused surgery found down, now with pna and sepsis.
   #.  Goals of care: The patient
s HCP and close friend as well as family
   visited and have agreed to no escalation of care and DNR.  They likely
   will talk today and probably will make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].  On a prior admission,
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical
   intervention and not wanting escalation of care.
   - Meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
   #.  Sepsis: Continued fever, currently requiring pressor support,
   however no further escalation of care.  Source likely his pneumonia
   given GNR in sputum and blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive E. Coli,
   antibiotics cipro/vanc.  Urine without evidence of infection.  Recent
   h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without evidence of abscess
   or perforation.
   - f/u more blood cultures
   - Continue vanc/cipro, plan to d/c vanc when sputum GPC speciation
   returns
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 1.9 from baseline
   1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with many
   liters of fluid.  He is likely coping poorly with sepsis because of his
   critical aortic stenosis.  No muddy-brown casts on UA yesterday.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   #. SBO: Previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal
   hernia. CT with evidence of SBO.  Surgery aware.  He has refused
   surgery in the past and there is no plans for surgery even if hernia
   worsens.
   #. Altered Mental Status: Found down, unclear prior symptoms.  Concern
   for trauma although CT head negative.  H/o a fib, INR low, concern for
   ischemic stroke, however global AMS, no obvious focal lesions.  Likely
   [**2-28**] toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis.  Now on sedation and
   difficult to assess.
   - Wean sedation and monitor for changes
   #. C-Spine precautions: Found down, unknown trauma.  Collared by EMS,
   unable to clear [**2-28**] AMS.  CT C-spine negative.  Unable to clear collar
   given AMS.
   #. CHF/AS: Last EF 60-70%, severe AS.  Has refused surgery in the
   past.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and an incarcerated hernia. He was found down and diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis. The patient's current condition is critical, and he is requiring pressor support. His goals of care have been discussed with his healthcare power of attorney and close friend, and they have agreed to no escalation of care and do not resuscitate (DNR).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient continues to have a fever, indicating ongoing infection. The source of the infection is likely his pneumonia, given the presence of gram-negative rods (GNR) in his sputum and blood. Antibiotics have been changed to ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, but more blood cultures are needed to confirm the effectiveness of the treatment.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires increased FiO2 overnight, indicating worsening oxygenation. The underlying etiology is likely the progressive pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient's heart rate is in the 120s, and there are ST depressions on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Beta-blockers are being held due to the patient's requirement for pressor support, although he is on Metoprolol 50mg at home. Coumadin should be held as well.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has stabilized at 1.9 from a baseline of 1.4-1.8, and urine output has decreased to 30ccs per hour despite receiving many liters of fluid. The patient's critical aortic stenosis may be contributing to poor renal perfusion. Trending the creatinine level, adjusting medications based on renal function, and avoiding nephrotoxic medications are recommended.

5. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a history of an incisional hernia, which is now reduced, but a new inguinal hernia has been identified. A CT scan shows evidence of SBO. Surgery is aware of the situation, but the patient has refused surgery in the past, and there are no plans for surgery even if the hernia worsens.

6. Altered Mental Status: The patient was found down, and the cause of his altered mental status is unclear. There is concern for trauma, although a CT head scan was negative. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his INR is low, raising concern for ischemic stroke. However, the patient has global altered mental status without obvious focal lesions, suggesting a toxic/metabolic abnormality from sepsis. Sedation should be weaned and monitored for changes.

- He was found down and diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis. The source of infection is likely his pneumonia, as Gram-negative rods (GNR) were found in his sputum and blood.
- The patient's blood cultures showed pan-sensitive E. coli, and he is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.
- The patient's family and healthcare proxy have agreed to no escalation of care and a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.
- The patient is requiring pressor support and has poor oxygenation due to progressive pneumonia.
- His atrial fibrillation is associated with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and he is currently not on beta-blockers due to the need for pressor support.
- The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level stabilized at 1.9 from baseline 1.4-1.8.
