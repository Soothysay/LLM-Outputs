   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old man with multiple worsening medical conditions, including a new diagnosis of HIV, Clostridium difficile infection, adrenal insufficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, worsening acidosis, and acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis.
- The patient also has left leg pain and erythema.
- The patient is critically ill and has a poor prognosis for renal recovery.
- The overall prognosis is grim due to the constellation of problems, particularly worsening renal failure.
- The patient's current medications include norepinephrine, omeprazole, and morphine sulfate.
- The patient has been started on empirical antibiotic therapy for suspected septic shock.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 110/ unknown mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals thin and frail appearance, mild epigastric tenderness, distended abdomen, right and left lower extremity edema, and warm skin.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 42.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL, low platelet count of 32 K/uL, and elevated lactate level of 2.9 mmol/L.
- The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, nasal swab, and stool culture have been obtained.
- Imaging studies, including torso/leg CT and OSH films, will be obtained.
- The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have septic shock based on the presence of leukocytosis, worsening vital signs, and the initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy. Prompt identification and treatment of sepsis are crucial to improve the patient's outcome.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis, as evidenced by the elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output. Continued monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has an active C. difficile infection, which can lead to severe colitis and complications such as toxic megacolon or perforation. Close monitoring for worsening abdominal pain, fever, and signs of sepsis is necessary.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has adrenal insufficiency, and it is important to continue corticosteroid replacement therapy to prevent adrenal crisis and associated complications.
5. HIV: The patient's recent diagnosis of HIV requires further evaluation of the viral load and CD4 count to guide antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Opport"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis.  Bcxs
   are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over past month;
   adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent hypotension.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Stool guiaic positive yesterday night so held off anticoagulation
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Poss
   2) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  It would be strange for patient to continue
   to have no response to antibiotics after this prolonged course.  Would
   be concerned for other sources of diarrhea versus hypogammoglobulinemia
   as cause of continued infection.   Given HIV concerned for other causes
   of chronic diarrhea like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too
   high for [**Doctor First Name **]
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   -Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - stool samples for O&P, isospora, crypto
   - OSH records
   3) Acute Renal Failure: Patient has unclear etiology of worsening renal
   function.  Concern for crystals in urine at OSH and it is possible that
   HAART was contributed by crystal formation or Fanconi
s syndrome.
   Still, granular casts here suggest ATN, which is also quite possible in
   context of hypotension and hypoperfusion.
   - UA with micro
   - Urine lytes and eos
   - Strict I/O's
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   4).  Thrombocytopenia
 Multiple possible etiologies for sepsis
   including MDS vs HIV vs HAART vs sepsis.  Given persistent low counts
   would be concerned that this is less likely to be due to ARV
s as
   previously thought.  Thrombocytopenia would be a common manifestation
   of MDS, however, and possible this is a chronic problem.
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR climbs
   5) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   6) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Like others picture is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports
   seems was recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but this could
   well suppress intrinsic adrenal access and unclear if we can obtain
   useful testing.
   -Continue dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   7) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis probably attributable to infection versus
   hypotension and hypoperfusion as well as contribution of [**Last Name (un) **].  Similar
   etiologies to NAGMA.
   -daily chem. 10
   -bicarbonate in maintenance fluids overnight so as to give the patient
   more reserve in terms of ABG
   8) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  [**Name2 (NI) **] clear myelodysplastic
   syndrome treated with steroids.   Also would be slightly concerned if
   this diagnosis was made without HIV status being known as that can also
   cause cytopenias.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including HIV, MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome), and adrenal insufficiency. He presents with hypotension and is suspected to have sepsis. The patient has been treated for C. difficile colitis but continues to have diarrhea. There are concerns about other sources of chronic diarrhea, such as parasites or HIV-related causes. The patient has a history of C. difficile being treated with vancomycin since October and vancomycin/IV metronidazole starting on October 21st. He continues to have diarrhea upon arrival to the MICU. 

The patient also has left leg swelling and tenderness, which suggests a possible DVT (deep vein thrombosis). A LENI (lower extremity venous ultrasound) was obtained yesterday, suggestive of a superficial femoral vein clot. The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to various causes including sepsis, MDS, HIV, or HAART (antiretroviral therapy). 

The patient has acute renal failure with unclear etiology. There are concerns about crystals in the urine at OSH (other hospital), possible HAART-related nephrotoxicity, or Fanconi syndrome. The patient also has thrombocytopenia with multiple possible etiologies including sepsis, MDS, HIV, or HAART. 

The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, which"

   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   3) Acute Renal Failure: Patient has unclear etiology of worsening renal
   function.  Concern for crystals in urine at OSH and it is possible that
   HAART was contributed by crystal formation or Fanconi
s syndrome.
   Still, granular casts here suggest ATN, which is also quite possible in
   context of hypotension and hypoperfusion.

   4).  Thrombocytopenia
 Multiple possible etiologies for sepsis
   including MDS vs HIV vs HAART vs sepsis.  Given persistent low counts
   would be concerned that this is less likely to be due to ARV
s as
   previously thought.  Thrombocytopenia would be a common manifestation
   of MDS, however, and possible this is a chronic problem.
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR climbs
   5) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   6) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Like others picture is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports
   seems was recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but this could
   well suppress intrinsic adrenal access and unclear if we can obtain
   useful testing.
   -Continue dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   7) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis probably attributable to infection versus
   hypotension and hypoperfusion as well as contribution of [**Last Name (un) **].  Similar
   etiologies to NAGMA.
   -daily chem. 10
   -bicarbonate in maintenance fluids overnight so as to give the patient
   more reserve in terms of ABG
   8) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  [**Name2 (NI) **] clear myelodysplastic
   syndrome treated with steroids.   Also would be slightly concerned if

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including HIV, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and has been diagnosed with several potential medical complications.

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or adrenal insufficiency. The elevated white blood cell count with bandemia and hypothermia suggest sepsis as the most likely cause. The source of infection is unclear, but the patient has a history of C. difficile infection and has been on antibiotics. The presence of tender and erythematous skin along the left groin/thigh and behind the left knee could indicate a skin infection or cellulitis. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and IV flagyl due to recent C. difficile history.

2. Left leg swelling/tenderness: Imaging suggests a superficial femoral vein clot, which could be a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This could explain the erythema along the thigh as well as edema. It may also be responsible for the inflammatory reaction resulting in hypothermia and leukocytosis. Stool guaiac positive yesterday night has temporarily held off anticoagulation, but further evaluation is needed.

3. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis.  Bcxs
   are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over past month;
   adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent hypotension.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Stool guiaic positive yesterday night so held off anticoagulation
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea

   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct?
   -RUQ Doppler to r/o thrombus.  LFts are . . .
   5) Acute Renal Failure: Dense ATN likely in setting of persistent
   hypotension.  Anuric poor prognosis.
   - UA with micro
   - Urine lytes and eos
   - Strict I/O's
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   4).  Thrombocytopenia

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over
   past month; adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent
   hypotension and hx of AI in past.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   -Using interpreter would attempt to get more history from patient re:
   his pain.
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -Would obtain RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   .
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - Could be consistent with pancreatitis.
   Does not endorse abdominal pain.  Have not elicitied history of nausea
   or vomiting or anorexia.   Preliminary read from CT yesterday did not
   suggest any stranding around pancreas.  No evidence of alk phos or
   tbili elevation suggestive of stones.
   -Would obtain RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD
   -keep NPO
   -IV fluid hydration today
   -obtain further hx with interpreter
   -trend amylase, lipase
   .
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.2 - 2.7.  Urinary sodium
   18, BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and
   multiple granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to
   persistent hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has
   poor prognosis for his kidney disease and may take long time for
   resolution given anuria.
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   .
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production.  Platelets relatively stable, INR
   went from 1.3 -> 1.7; no overt evidence of bleeding, smear negative for
   schistos.  Other causes could be secondary to his HAART therapy or
   secondary to underlying sepsis.
   -Check coags tonight
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Trend platelets daily
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR continues to climb
   .
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   -f/u with ID about whether or not can restart HAART therapy
   .
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   -F/u AM cortisol
   -F/u stim test
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   .
   10) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2
   is 23.  Etiology of gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic
   acid accumulation (has improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal
   failure on top.  Non-gap acidosis could be secondary to recent
   diarrhea, and if adrenally insufficient, hypoaldosteronism.
   -Trend lactates [**Hospital1 **]
   -Hydration today for further resolution of lactic acidosis
   -f/u stim test
   -f/u renal recs
   .
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - Hydration today (can give NS 150 ccs/hr) for potential
   underlying pancreatitis as well as for lactic acidosis.  Keep NPO
   except meds for bowel rest.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low
   this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He presents with hypotension, presumed sepsis, and possible hypovolemia or adrenal insufficiency. The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which has been treated with vancomycin and metronidazole. However, he continues to have diarrhea. The abdominal CT shows evidence of sigmoiditis, suggesting possible ischemic etiology given the elevated lactate levels. There is also a hepatic infarct noted on the CT scan, which could be secondary to an embolic event. The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to his MDS or underlying sepsis. He also has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to persistent hypotension. There is an elevated amylase/lipase level, but without clear evidence of pancreatitis. Lastly, the patient has an anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly secondary to lactic acid accumulation due to hypoperfusion. The patient's prognosis for kidney recovery is poor due to anuria."

   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over
   past month; adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent
   hypotension and hx of AI in past.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   -Using interpreter would attempt to get more history from patient re:
   his pain.
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -Would obtain RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   .
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - Could be consistent with pancreatitis.
   Does not endorse abdominal pain.  Have not elicitied history of nausea
   or vomiting or anorexia.   Preliminary read from CT yesterday did not
   suggest any stranding around pancreas.  No evidence of alk phos or
   tbili elevation suggestive of stones.
   -Would obtain RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD
   -keep NPO
   -IV fluid hydration today
   -obtain further hx with interpreter
   -trend amylase, lipase
   .
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.2 - 2.7.  Urinary sodium
   18, BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and
   multiple granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to
   persistent hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has
   poor prognosis for his kidney disease and may take long time for
   resolution given anuria.
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   .
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production.  Platelets relatively stable, INR
   went from 1.3 -> 1.7; no overt evidence of bleeding, smear negative for
   schistos.  Other causes could be secondary to his HAART therapy or
   secondary to underlying sepsis.
   -Check coags tonight
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Trend platelets daily
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR continues to climb
   .
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   -f/u with ID about whether or not can restart HAART therapy
   .
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   -F/u AM cortisol
   -F/u stim test
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   .
   10) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2
   is 23.  Etiology of gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic
   acid accumulation (has improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal
   failure on top.  Non-gap acidosis could be secondary to recent
   diarrhea, and if adrenally insufficient, hypoaldosteronism.
   -Trend lactates [**Hospital1 **]
   -Hydration today for further resolution of lactic acidosis
   -f/u stim test
   -f/u renal recs
   .
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - Hydration today (can give NS 150 ccs/hr) for potential
   underlying pancreatitis as well as for lactic acidosis.  Keep NPO
   except meds for bowel rest.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low
   this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He presented with hypotension and was transferred to the MICU. The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis and was treated with vancomycin and metronidazole. He continues to have persistent diarrhea. The abdominal CT shows evidence of sigmoiditis consistent with colitis. Other potential causes of chronic diarrhea, such as parasites, should be considered, especially given his HIV status. The patient also has a hepatic infarct, left leg swelling and tenderness suggestive of DVT, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated amylase/lipase level. His condition requires further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's markedly elevated WBC count with bandemia, hypothermia, and persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation suggests a possible sepsis.
2. C. difficile colitis: The patient's history of C. difficile and ongoing diarrhea despite treatment raises concerns for persistent or recurrent infection.
3. Hepatic infarct: The wedge-shaped area seen on the abdominal CT could be indicative of a hepatic infarct, which could be secondary to an embolic event.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's left leg swelling and tenderness, along with the presence of a clot in"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia, complicated by adrenal
   insufficiency.  Sepsis seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC
   count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5), vs adrenal insufficiency
   crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Has
   h/o C diff at OSH, now s/p tx, repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Overnight Hct dropped from 29 -> 26.3 yesterday
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - NG lavage was deferred yesterday given pt's Hct appeared to be stable
   - Place NG tube, lavage
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   - f/u hemolysis labs
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.
   - RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD today
   -IV fluid hydration today
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.8.  Urinary sodium 18,
   BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and multiple
   granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to persistent
   hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has poor prognosis
   for his kidney disease and may take long time for resolution given
   anuria.  Try repeat fluid bolus, pt not responding, despite maintenance
   of BP.  ? reduced intravascular volume and high SVR?
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production, but now dropping precipitously to
   27.  INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7, now 2.1; no overt evidence of bleeding,
   although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be secondary to his HAART
   therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.  Elevated fibrinogen, FDP
   pending.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -obtain HIV testing, VL per ID.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   - Maintaining BP which doesn't suggest acute decompensation,  could try
   pulse dose steroids and see if he has improvement.
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   10) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic acid accumulation (has
   improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal failure on top
   - Lactate improving at 1.4
   - f/u renal recs
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - Fluid boluses. NPO until NG lavage.  Replenish electrolytes
   (calcium was low this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   14) ACCESS

   count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5), vs adrenal insufficiency
   crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Has
   h/o C diff at OSH, now s/p tx, repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, d/c heparin, start argatroban
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production, but now dropping precipitously to
   27.  INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7, now 2.1; no overt evidence of bleeding,
   although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be secondary to his HAART
   therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.  Elevated fibrinogen, FDP
   pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable state ( wedge shaped liver
   lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   - HIT antibody
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Overnight Hct dropped from 29 -> 26.3 yesterday
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - NG lavage was deferred yesterday given pt's Hct appeared to be stable
   - Place NG tube, lavage
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.
   - RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD today
   -IV fluid hydration today
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.8.  Urinary sodium 18,
   BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and multiple
   granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to persistent
   hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has poor prognosis
   for his kidney disease and may take long time for resolution given
   anuria.  Try repeat fluid bolus, pt not responding, despite maintenance
   of BP.  ? reduced intravascular volume and high SVR?
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -obtain HIV testing, VL per ID.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   - Maintaining BP which doesn't suggest acute decompensation,  could try
   pulse dose steroids and see if he has improvement.
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   10) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic acid accumulation (has
   improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal failure on top
   - Lactate improving at 1.4
   - f/u renal recs
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - NPO until NG lavage.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low
   this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   14) ACCESS

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including HIV, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute kidney injury (AKI), sepsis, possible hepatic infarct, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, and anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient received a 500cc bolus to improve urine output, which resulted in a fall in oxygen saturation (O2 sat) to the low 80s. He was started on high-flow nasal cannula (NRB) and then continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). His O2 sat improved.
- The patient was started on heparin, but the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) became supratherapeutic, so the heparin was held.
- Morning cortisol levels improved from 2.5 to 8.9 after cosyntropin stimulation test.
- Stool studies were negative for ova and parasites, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Clostridium difficile.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been stable, and no nasogastric (NG) lavage was performed.
- Renal function has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV, C. Diff, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, worsening renal failure, acidosis, and hypoxemia in the setting of anuria. The patient is critically ill and requires aggressive treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and septic shock may lead to further organ dysfunction and failure.

2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if he is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This may require mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support measures.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. Diff, which can cause severe diarrhea and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis.

4. Lower extremity DVT: The patient has a lower extremity DVT, which can potentially embolize to the lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. This is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, leading to anuria (no urine output). This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, metabolic acidosis, and the accumulation of waste products in the blood.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with multiple health issues including a new diagnosis of HIV, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, worsening renal failure, acidosis, and hypoxemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is considered critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there are signs of septic shock. Treatment includes antibiotics and possibly vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to low oxygen levels. He is currently on CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) but is unable to effectively clear fluids due to renal failure. Further evaluation and management of pneumonia may be necessary.
3. C. diff Infection: The patient has a C. diff infection, which is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole. Re-evaluation for C. diff status is planned.
4. LLE DVT: The patient has a DVT in the lower left extremity. With a further drop in platelet count, the treatment will be switched to argatroban, and a HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) test will be performed.

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with CPAP to maintain oxygenation.  Ddx includes flash
   pulmonary edema, atelectasis/lung collapse, PNA, and PE particularly
   given concern for possible  hypercoagulability with HIT.  CXR
   supporting pna, or possible lung collapse.  RLL effusion also possible,
   consistent with u/s read.
   - 7.28 19 171 9  consistent with hyperventilation due to metabolic
   acidosis.  oxygenating well.
   - evluate for pulm edema - ECHO pending, not responding to lasix, but
   also not makign significant urine.
   - CXR this AM shows RLL opacity possible effusion, collapse, pna.
   Still no sputum culture obtained.
   - family wanted dialysis - - line placement today
   #) Hypotension: Mostly resolved.  Most likely due to sepsis given lack
   of response to volume.  Pt also has markedly elevated WBC count w/
   bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  Adrenal crisis, less likely given
   maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Cdiff negative X3.  Possible
   pneumonia per CXR, possible cellulitis on LLE.  CT suggestive of
   sigmoiditis, but no other clear infectious sources.   Bcxs NGTD.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   - d/c IV flagyl and po vanco given neg Cdiff.
   - avoid volume given ? CHF, and pt anuric.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -On argatroban for ? HIT
   #).  Thrombocytopenia
 Has hx of MDS,  but platelets dropped
   preciptiously to the 20s - 30s.   INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7; no overt
   evidence of bleeding, although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be
   secondary to his HAART therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.
   Elevated fibrinogen, FDP pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable
   state ( wedge shaped liver lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Obtain OSH records
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   - HIT antibody pending
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Stable at 29-30 since.
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - PM Hct stable
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   - Hemolysis labs: Elevated LDH and Tbili, normal hapto, no shistocytes
   -> low probability of hemolysis
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   - line placement likely today, will have to hold argatroban.  Give FFP
   and platelets.  ?Plt shortage.
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   - VL/CD4 pending.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Cdiff negative
   - f/u O&P
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.   RUQ u/s: Patent
   and appropriate hepatic vasculature, No gallstones and no signs of
   cholecystitis.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.  RUQ
   US clear.
   - no need to follow lipase and amylase
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - Maintaining BP which doesn't suggest acute decompensation,  could try
   pulse dose steroids and see if he has improvement.
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   #) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure.  (Initially also
   due to lactic acid which has now improved)
   - f/u renal recs
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)

The patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including new diagnoses of HIV, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and adrenal insufficiency. He presented with hypotension and respiratory distress requiring non-invasive ventilation. He has a history of Clostridium difficile infection, which has been treated multiple times. The patient's current conditions include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute renal failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. Further evaluation with echocardiogram is pending to assess cardiac function.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and consolidation on chest X-ray raises the suspicion of pneumonia. Sputum culture is pending to identify the causative organism.
3. Sepsis: The patient's systemic inflammatory response, hypotension, and organ dysfunction indicate sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the source of infection is being investigated.

   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space

   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with CPAP to maintain oxygenation.  Ddx includes flash
   pulmonary edema, atelectasis/lung collapse, PNA, and PE particularly
   given concern for possible  hypercoagulability with HIT.  CXR
   supporting pna, or possible lung collapse.  RLL effusion also possible,
   consistent with u/s read.
   - 7.28 19 171 9  consistent with hyperventilation due to metabolic
   acidosis.  oxygenating well.
   - evluate for pulm edema
 ECHO unremarkable, not responding to lasix,
   but also not makign significant urine.
   - CXR this AM shows RLL opacity possible effusion, collapse, pna.
   Still no sputum culture obtained.
   - family wanted dialysis -  line placement today
   #) Hypotension: Mostly resolved.  Most likely due to sepsis given lack
   of response to volume.  Pt also has markedly elevated WBC count w/
   bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  Adrenal crisis, less likely given
   maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Cdiff negative X3.  Possible
   pneumonia per CXR, possible cellulitis on LLE.  CT suggestive of
   sigmoiditis, but no other clear infectious sources.   Bcxs NGTD.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for Cdiff.
   - avoid volume given ? CHF, and pt anuric.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -On argatroban for ? HIT
   #).  Thrombocytopenia
 Has hx of MDS,  but platelets dropped
   preciptiously to the 20s - 30s.   INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7; no overt
   evidence of bleeding, although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be
   secondary to his HAART therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.
   Elevated fibrinogen, FDP pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable
   state ( wedge shaped liver lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - [**Hospital1 **]  coags and platelets
   -Obtain OSH records
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   - HIT antibody pending
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Stable at 29-30 since.
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - PM Hct stable
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   - Hemolysis labs: Elevated LDH and Tbili, normal hapto, no shistocytes
   -> low probability of hemolysis
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   - line placement likely today, will have to hold argatroban.  Give FFP
   and platelets.  ?Plt shortage.
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   - VL/CD4 pending.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - repeat Cdiff tox
   - f/u O&P
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.   RUQ u/s: Patent
   and appropriate hepatic vasculature, No gallstones and no signs of
   cholecystitis.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.  RUQ
   US clear.
   - no need to follow lipase and amylase
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - strt stress dose steroids
   #) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure.  (Initially also
   due to lactic acid which has now improved)
   - f/u renal recs
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including HIV, MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome), and adrenal insufficiency. He presented with hypotension and respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. The patient requires non-invasive ventilation support and has a history of C. difficile colitis, DVT (deep vein thrombosis), renal failure, sepsis, and thrombocytopenia. His current condition includes acute respiratory decompensation, hypotension, possible pneumonia, DVT, acute renal failure, and suspected HIV infection. He also has a history of MDS and adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory distress and need for CPAP support may indicate flash pulmonary edema, which is a sudden onset of pulmonary edema.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and findings on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
3. PE (pulmonary embolism): Given the patient's history of DVT and hypercoagulable state, there is a concern for a pulmonary embolism.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels may lead to hyperkalemia, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure.
6. Sepsis"

   platelets stable
   5. HIV: Off ARVs for now.  Start Bactrim ppx.
   6. Liver lesion: Wedge shaped - possible infarct but would be rare for
   liver.  Could also be some metastatic lesion.  RUQ ultrasound today
   7. Renal failure: Will need HD line to initiiate HD - needs reversal of

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 81-year-old man with multiple medical issues, including a new diagnosis of HIV, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, worsening renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, encephalopathy, language barrier, and renal failure. 

The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation since the morning due to increased Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern and long periods of apnea. He is also receiving norepinephrine and argatroban infusions. Other medications include furosemide, morphine sulfate, and antibiotics for C. diff and severe sepsis. 

Vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but decreased urine output and rising creatinine levels indicating worsening renal failure. The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, as evidenced by declining oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate. 

Physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema and bilateral peripheral pulses not assessed. Neurological examination shows no attentiveness, inability to follow simple commands, and no movement or assessed tone. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient has been tested for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). 

Assessment and plan include deep vein thrombosis, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis. The patient requires immediate interventions, including continued vanc/cefepime for septic shock, elective intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure, treatment for C. diff, anticoagulation for DVT, and management of HIV. 

Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure leading to the need for mechanical ventilation, progression of renal failure requiring dialysis, development of further infections due to immunocompromised state, and potential bleeding complications from anticoagulation therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with ASSIST w/ FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8.  Likely multifactorial
   secondary to atelectasis  vs respiratory distress in setting of
   tachypnea from metabolic acidosis versus pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia
   less likely as CXR  not supportive of this dx.
   - Oxygenating well on current settings w/ most recent gas of 7.45, 25,
   191.  Maintaining current settings given tenuous status.
   - F/u sputum cxs; given CD4 is 40, elevated D-dimer, would also test
   sputum for PCP; also consider testing for MAC given low CD4.
   -Clinically does appear mildly volume overloaded esp in setting of
   receiving fluids and multiple products w/o making urine although CXR
   does not show sig edema: was +2 L yesterday.   [**Month (only) 8**] go for dialysis
   today and would try to take off -2L to make net balance 0.
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal
   pressors.   Less likely hypovolemia given poor repsonse to fluids.  In
   terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **] negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT
   suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,
   possible pneumonia per CXR.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   4.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelets falling from 60 -> 11, responded to
   transfusion w/ platelets currently at 110.   Differential dx is broad
   but etiologies we should consider include:  DIC vs  worsening HIV
   infection (CD4 fallen from 250 -> 40 in last month) vs hep C induced
   thrombocytopenia vs ITP vs TTP vs HIT.   DIC is possible in setting of
   underlying sepsis, especially since concomittant HCT drop, elevated
   D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and rising INR; made less likely by
   abscence of schistocytes on smear.  HIV can directly damage platelets
   and may have recently worsened w/ recent CD4 drop over past month; both
   HIV and hep C can also induce an ITP.  TTP possible given renal
   failure, mental status change, hypothermia, thrombocytopenia and
   anemia, but made less likely by abscence of schistocytes.  HIT unlikely
   given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   -Would obtain heme-consult for better eval of peripheral smear
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   .
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   .
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT fell from 26 to 22 overnight.  Has had
   guiaic positive stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   Received 1 Unit this AM
   -Would follow HCTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   -Prior hemolysis labs have been negative but would repeat hemolysis
   labs today (can add on to AM labs) Tbili, hapto; f/u peripheral smear.
   .
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.
   -Check cryoglobulins, C3, C4 levels, and ANCA.
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Went for HD line placement yesterday; touch base w/ renal about
   possibility of HD today.
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting (discuss w/ ID re: starting
   HAART esp as could be related to thrombocytopenia)
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and checking for G6PD deficiency prior to starting dapsone for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   [**Doctor First Name **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Raises question of
   hypercoagulability.  Stable.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - strt stress dose steroids
   #) Gap Metabolic acidosis - Likely secondary to renal failure.
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Make this a priority: obtaining OSH records.  Someone should call and
   follow this up, this AM.
   #)FEN -  Speech and swallow deferred as pt on CPAP.  Replenish
   electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - FULL
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with new diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He presented with hypotension and was transferred to the MICU. He has multiple medical complications including acute respiratory decompensation, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, DVT, acute renal failure, C. difficile colitis, hepatic infarct, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Decompensation: The patient requires respiratory support with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 8. Oxygenation is well maintained with current settings. Pneumonia is less likely as the CXR does not support this diagnosis. Sputum cultures will be obtained, and testing for PCP and MAC will be considered given the patient's low CD4 count.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, but other possibilities include hypovolemia and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is on minimal pressors and has responded well. Blood and sputum cultures will be obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has fallen from 60 to 11 and responded to platelet transfusion. Differential diagnoses include DIC, worsening HIV infection, hep C-induced thromb"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with ASSIST w/ FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8.  Likely multifactorial
   secondary to atelectasis  vs respiratory distress in setting of
   tachypnea from metabolic acidosis versus pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia
   less likely as CXR  not supportive of this dx.
   - Oxygenating well on current settings w/ most recent gas of 7.45, 25,
   191.  Maintaining current settings given tenuous status.
   - F/u sputum cxs; given CD4 is 40, elevated D-dimer, would also test
   sputum for PCP; also consider testing for MAC given low CD4.
   -Clinically does appear mildly volume overloaded esp in setting of
   receiving fluids and multiple products w/o making urine although CXR
   does not show sig edema: was +2 L yesterday.   [**Month (only) 8**] go for dialysis
   today and would try to take off -2L to make net balance 0.
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal
   pressors.   Less likely hypovolemia given poor repsonse to fluids.  In
   terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **] negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT
   suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,
   possible pneumonia per CXR.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   4.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelets falling from 60 -> 11, responded to
   transfusion w/ platelets currently at 110.   Differential dx is broad
   but etiologies we should consider include:  DIC vs  worsening HIV
   infection (CD4 fallen from 250 -> 40 in last month) vs hep C induced
   thrombocytopenia vs ITP vs TTP vs HIT.   DIC is possible in setting of
   underlying sepsis, especially since concomittant HCT drop, elevated
   D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and rising INR; made less likely by
   abscence of schistocytes on smear.  HIV can directly damage platelets
   and may have recently worsened w/ recent CD4 drop over past month; both
   HIV and hep C can also induce an ITP.  TTP possible given renal
   failure, mental status change, hypothermia, thrombocytopenia and
   anemia, but made less likely by abscence of schistocytes.  HIT unlikely
   given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   -Would obtain heme-consult for better eval of peripheral smear
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   .
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   .
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT fell from 26 to 22 overnight.  Has had
   guiaic positive stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   Received 1 Unit this AM
   -Would follow HCTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   -Prior hemolysis labs have been negative but would repeat hemolysis
   labs today (can add on to AM labs) Tbili, hapto; f/u peripheral smear.
   .
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.
   -Check cryoglobulins, C3, C4 levels, and ANCA.
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Went for HD line placement yesterday; touch base w/ renal about
   possibility of HD today.
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting (discuss w/ ID re: starting
   HAART esp as could be related to thrombocytopenia)
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and checking for G6PD deficiency prior to starting dapsone for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   [**Doctor First Name **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Raises question of
   hypercoagulability.  Stable.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - strt stress dose steroids
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   -F/u smear
   #) Gap Metabolic acidosis - Likely secondary to renal failure.
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Make this a priority: obtaining OSH records.  Someone should call and
   follow this up, this AM.
   #)FEN -  Speech and swallow deferred as pt on CPAP.  Replenish
   electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - FULL
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with recent diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted with acute respiratory decompensation, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, DVT, acute renal failure, C. difficile colitis, hepatic infarct, and acute mental status change. The patient has been treated with various medications including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiretroviral therapy, prophylactic medications, and stress dose steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute respiratory decompensation: The patient requires respiratory support due to respiratory distress, likely secondary to atelectasis, metabolic acidosis, or pulmonary edema. Oxygenation is maintained with the current settings, and further evaluation for pneumonia and other causes is recommended.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or adrenal insufficiency. Pressor requirements have decreased, suggesting improvement, but ongoing monitoring and treatment are necessary.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has significantly dropped from 60 to 11, responding to platelet transfusion. The differential diagnosis includes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), worsening HIV infection, hep C-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), thrombotic thrombocytopenic pur"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV, C. diff, and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently experiencing worsening renal failure and acidosis, as well as hypoxemia in the setting of anuria. The patient's condition is critical, with multiple organ systems compromised. He is on mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and various medications for septic shock, C. diff, and other conditions. The patient's family has changed his code status to DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic shock: The patient continues to require pressors and has an emerging vesicular rash on the left lower extremity, which may indicate a need for antiviral treatment.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a right upper lobe (RUL) collapse on chest X-ray, and there is a plan to increase PEEP and perform a bronchoscopic evaluation. Pulmonary edema has resolved with positive pressure ventilation.
3. C. diff: The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole.
4. LLE DVT: The patient has a lower extremity DVT, and anticoagulation therapy has been initiated.
5. HIV: The patient is off antiretroviral therapy for now and is starting dapsone and azithromycin prophylaxis.
6. Liver lesion: An RUQ ultrasound is planned to further evaluate a liver lesion.
7. Renal failure: CRRT has been initiated to manage acute renal failure.
8. Pancytopenia: The patient's blood counts are dropping, and labs for DIC, hemolysis, and other causes of pancytopenia are being checked. A history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is noted, and cryo, complement, ANCA levels should be assessed.
9. Other issues: The remainder of the patient's medical concerns will be managed by the ICU team.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - no plan for weaning today
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   - hold CVVH
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Goal to transfuse > 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.
   #)FEN -  TF.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of new diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with sepsis. He has several medical complications, including acute respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute pain, impaired skin integrity, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient also has a low platelet count, anemia, and is experiencing diarrhea.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recent lung collapse and bronchoscopy, which suggests a possible respiratory infection.

2. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics due to an elevated white blood cell count and bandemia. His blood cultures are pending, and he has not responded to volume resuscitation.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a DVT in the superficial femoral vein. This could explain the erythema along his thigh and edema.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has weeping skin, indicating potential skin breakdown or pressure ulcers.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric (not producing urine) and has a high creatinine level, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to hypotensive insult to the kidneys or other factors such as hep-C related vasculitis.

6. HIV infection"

   - On CVVH - net even over last several hours given icnreasing pressor
   support
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Continue CVVH
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.
   #)FEN -  TF.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed. Some of the potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory decompensation and has been intubated. There is a concern for pneumonia, but the chest X-ray does not support this diagnosis. Further investigations, such as sputum cultures and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), are needed to identify the underlying cause of the respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection, including leukocytosis with bandemia, hypothermia, and tachycardia. The source of infection is unclear, but possibilities include cellulitis on the left lower extremity, possible pneumonia, or sigmoid colitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed superficial femoral vein clot. It is unclear whether it is provoked or unprovoked. Heparin therapy has been restarted after being temporarily held due to elevated PTT levels.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has improved with transfusion. The differential diagnosis includes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), drug reaction, Hepatitis C-induced thrombocytopenia, or immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Further evaluation of the peripheral smear and consultation with hematology-oncology"

","The patient is an 81-year-old man with a new diagnosis of HIV, C. diff, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, worsening renal failure, acidosis, and hypoxemia in the setting of anuria. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/Septic shock: The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefepime, which are antibiotics commonly used to treat severe infections. The patient's blood pressure remains low, and there is an ongoing need for pressor support, indicating persistent hypotension and potential septic shock.

2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient had a right upper lobe (RUL) collapse due to a mucous plug, which was successfully cleared through bronchoscopy. However, the patient continues to require mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole to address the C. diff infection. It is important to monitor for improvement in symptoms and resolution of the infection.

4. Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed DVT in the lower extremity"

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Met with the son and daughter of Mr. [**Known lastname **] this evening.  We discussed
   the lack of recovery of renal function and the multi system organ
   failure despite aggressive measures.  I told them that I felt his
   prognosis was very poor.  Given this, they have decided to switch his
   goals of care to comfort measures, and are planning to withdraw
   mechanical ventilation and pressors in the morning.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV, C. diff, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, worsening renal failure, acidosis, and hypoxemia in the setting of anuria. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypotension/Septic shock: The patient is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for septic shock. The pressor requirement is increasing, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability.

2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient had a right upper lobe (RUL) collapse due to a mucous plug, which was resolved after bronchoscopy. Currently, the patient is oxygenating well.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous (IV) metronidazole for C. diff infection.

4. Lower Extremity DVT: The patient has a lower extremity DVT, for which heparin gtt was initiated but is currently being held due to persistently high partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

5. HIV: The patient is off antiretroviral therapy (ARVs) for now and is being given dapsone and azithromycin prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including HIV, MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome), and adrenal insufficiency. He presented with hypotension and was transferred to the MICU. The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and recent admissions. His current vital signs show hypotension, low blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute. He has diffuse rales in his lungs, generalized edema, and is unresponsive. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, high blood glucose, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures were drawn for fungal and viral infections, and he is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, recent infections, and hypotension, there is a risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and infection control measures are crucial.
2. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's abnormal kidney and liver function tests, along with other lab abnormalities, suggest the possibility of multi-organ dysfunction. Frequent assessment of organ functions and timely intervention will be necessary.
3. Respiratory complications: Mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma. Fre"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - no plan for weaning today
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   - hold CVVH
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Goal to transfuse > 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.
   #)FEN -  TF.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - DNR
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including HIV, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and adrenal insufficiency. He presented with hypotension and was transferred to the MICU for further management. The patient has experienced several complications during his stay, including acute respiratory decompensation, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute renal failure, C. difficile colitis, hepatic infarct, and acute mental status change. The patient has also been diagnosed with HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory decompensation: The patient's respiratory status remains stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy. However, volume overload and mental status interfere with respiratory failure. Pneumonia is less likely due to the absence of supportive findings on the chest X-ray. Broad differential diagnosis is maintained given the diagnosis of HIV.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, considering the lack of response to fluid resuscitation and elevated white blood cell count with bandemia. Other possibilities include adrenal crisis and hypovolemia. The patient is on vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient had an episode of acute thromb"
