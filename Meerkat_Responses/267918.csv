   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58-year-old man with history of
   congenital heart disease and repairs in [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status
   post replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves with mosaic
   bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the
   tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on coumadin and multiple
   GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for continued management of heart
   failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but possible hypoventilated [**1-5**] CHF exacerbation or oxygen
   narcosis. PE also could present similarly but patient was therapeutic
   on coumadin to OSH. No report of ingestions. Hypoxia improved with
   ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung parenchymal
   disease.
   - consider PA catheter/Right heart cath in am
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - PE is felt unlikely at this time; will defer CTA
   - f/u TTE results
   - f/u TSH
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology. Sv02 on admission 92 but unclear how
   to interpret given strong possibility of VSD/PFO.  Also CVP measured at
   16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. No
   lactate to indicated hypoperfusion. Maybe be hypovolemic [**1-5**]
   overdiuresis or hemotypsis. No WBC or fever to indicate underlying
   infection/septic shock. Certainly, cardiogenic shock is possible but
   need more data prior to definitely diagnosis.
   - wean levophed/dopamine as tolerated
   - additional fluid bolus will be given as patient appears clinically
   dry
   - defer swan-ganz placement for now
   - hold antibiotics as no evidences of infection but follow up blood
   cultures
   - trend hct as below
   .
   # Hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.
   - f/u final CXR
   - f/u sputum Cx and gram stain
   - consult pulmonary in am
   - non-contrast chest CT
   - hold anticoagulation
   - maintain active T+S
   - trend hct q8h, xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - eventually may proceed to RHC
   - f/u TTE
   - cont dopamine and levophed to titrate MAP>60
   - appreciate cardiothoracic surgery input re: valve integrity
   - hold diureses
   - would benefit from beta blocker once hemodynamically stable
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD on cath [**12-11**]. Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely [**1-5**] to ischemia.
   - f/u EKG
   - f/u cardiac enzymes
   - d/c ASA
   - continue statin
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation once hemoptysis improves
   .
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr unknown as last documented Cr here when patient
   was acutely ill. Cr now 1.8.  Urine lytes consistent with pre-renal
   etiology.
   - trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins if possible
   - improved on fluids last night, will continue to bolus
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Clinically, dry mucous membranes. Likely [**1-5**]
   hypovolemia in setting of recent diureses of 5-7L at OSH.
   - 1L NS bolus
   - trend serum lytes
   - hold diuresis
   - f/u TSH
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/Cef/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - trend eos
   - monitor for now
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved at OSH, not on heparin so HIT unlikely. No
   oozing from PIV.
   - f/u DIC labs
   - trend plts
   - xfuse plt<10 or <50k if bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has a history of anemia, unclear baseline hct, also
   currently bleeding.
   - guaiac stools
   - f/u iron studies
   - trend hct q8h, xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple repairs, including replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications that require attention:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2 in the 60s and a baseline bicarb in the 40s. This condition could be due to hypoventilation caused by CHF exacerbation, oxygen narcosis, or pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Hypotension: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is unclear. The SvO2 on admission was 92%, but it is difficult to interpret due to the possibility of VSD/PFO. The CVP measured at 16, but given TR (tricuspid regurgitation), it may not accurately reflect the volume status or preload. No lactate levels were mentioned to indicate hypoperfusion. Possible causes include hypovolemia, overdiuresis, or hemoptysis.

3. Hemoptysis: The patient has grossly bloody material from the ET tube upon admission, which had been ongoing at OSH. It is unclear if this is due to traumatic intubation or coumadin use. Preliminary chest X-ray is unchanged. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58-year-old man with history of
   congenital heart disease and repairs in [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status
   post replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves with mosaic
   bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the
   tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on coumadin and multiple
   GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for continued management of heart
   failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but possible hypoventilated [**1-5**] CHF exacerbation or oxygen
   narcosis. PE also could present similarly but patient was therapeutic
   on coumadin to OSH. No report of ingestions. Hypoxia improved with
   ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung parenchymal
   disease.
   -Consider PA catheter/Right heart cath in am
   -wean vent as tolerated
   -consider CTA chest in am
   -f/u TSH
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology. Sv02 on admission 92 but unclear how
   to interpret given strong possibility of VSD/PFO.  Also CVP measured at
   16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. No
   lactate to indicated hypoperfusion. Maybe be hypovolemic [**1-5**]
   overdiuresis or hemotypsis. No WBC or fever to indicate underlying
   infection/septic shock. Certainly, cardiogenic shock is possible but
   need more data prior to definitely diagnosis.
   -wean levophed/dopamine as tolerated
   -1L fluid bolus
   -would benefit from swan-ganz; deferred overnight given concern of
   valve replacements and questionable anatomy
   -hold antibiotics as no evidences of infection but follow up blood
   cultures
   -trend hct as below
   .
   # Hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival which was reassuring given patients. Prelim CXR unchanged. The
   differential includes PNA/bronchitis, pulm AVM, or cancer.
   -f/u final CXR
   -f/u sputum Cx and gram stain
   -consult pulmonary in am
   -consider CT chest in am when safe to travel
   -hold anticoagulation
   -maintain active T+S
   -trend hct q8hours, xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   -swan-ganz/RH cath in am
   -repeat echo in am
   -cont dopamine and levophed to titrate MAP>60
   -appreciate cardiothoracic surgery input re: valve integrity
   -hold diureses
   -would benefit from beta blocker once hemodynamically stable
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD on cath [**12-11**]. Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely [**1-5**] to ischemia.
   -f/u EKG
   -f/u cardiac enzymes
   -asa 81mg daily, statin
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   -monitor on tele
   -monitor coags
   -resume anticoagulation once hemoptysis improves
   .
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr unknown as last documented Cr here when patient
   was acutely ill. Cr now 1.8.
   -trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins if possible
   -f/u urine elytes
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Clinically, dry mucous membranes. Likely [**1-5**]
   hypovolemia in setting of recent diureses of 5-7L at OSH.
   -1L NS bolus
   -f/u Urine lytes
   -hold diuresis
   -f/u TSH
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug

   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   -trend eos
   -monitor for now

   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved at OSH, not on heparin so HIT unlikely. No
   oozing from PIV.
   -f/u DIC labs

   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries, including valve replacements and closure of VSD and PFO. He has chronic atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin. He presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, hemoptysis, and possible pneumonia caused by MRSA. He also has a history of pulmonary hypertension, worsening right ventricular (RV) failure, and tricuspid regurgitation. Other issues include acute renal failure, hyponatremia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diabetes, depression/anxiety, and liver problems. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia, which needs to be managed with appropriate ventilatory support.
2. Hypotension: The cause of hypotension is unclear, but possible causes include hypovolemia, overdiuresis, or hemoptysis. Close monitoring and fluid management are necessary.
3. Hemoptysis: The patient has grossly bloody material from the endotracheal tube, which may be due to traumatic intubation or coumadin use. Further investigation is required to determine the cause.
4. MRSA pneumonia: The patient has MRSA in the sputum culture, and appropriate antibiotic therapy needs to be continued for the required duration"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries, including valve replacements and closure of VSD and PFO. He has chronic atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin. The patient was admitted for management of heart failure and is currently in the ICU. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, hemoptysis, and worsening right ventricular failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory acidosis with compensation. His current condition of hypercarbic respiratory failure may be due to hypoventilation, possibly exacerbated by CHF exacerbation or oxygen narcosis. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to several factors, including hypovolemia from overdiuresis, hemoptysis, or cardiogenic shock. Additional data is required to confirm the diagnosis.

3. Hemoptysis: The patient has grossly bloody material from the ET tube upon admission. This could be due to traumatic intubation or a underlying condition such as pneumonia, bronchiectasis, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM), or cancer. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause.

4. Right Ventricular Failure: The patient's worsening right ventricular failure may be caused by pulmonary hypertension, worsening VSD, mitral regurgitation"

   TTE: TR Gradient 64-70, Pulmonic Valve Peak Gradient 39 mmHg.  The left
   and right atria are markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
   by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is a
   1cm mid-muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) with bidirectional
   flow. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
   global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
   the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral
   valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated,
   with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] A tricuspid
   valve annuloplasty ring is present with normal gradient. Moderate to
   severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. A well-seated pulmonic valve prosthesis
   is present. The gradient is high normal. No pulmonary regurgitation is
   seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Muscular ventricular septal defect with bidirectional flow.
   Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate to severe tricuspid
   regurgitation. Slightly increased pulmonic bioprosthetic gradient.
   Normal functioning mitral bioprosthesis.
   CT CHEST:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence for diffuse systemic lung disease such as interstitial
   lung disease. No fibrosis. No significant pulmonary edema.
   2. Small pleural effusions with relatively out of proportion bibasal
   atelectasis. This atelectasis could certainly compromise the limited
   reserve of this patient. Pneumonia may also coexist in this atelectatic
   lung.
   3. Right pulmonary artery dilatation compresses mainstem bronchi
   particulary onthe right which may also contribute to the limtied
   reserve.
   4. Pattern of ground glass nodulrity can be seen in primary pulmonary
   hypertension.
   5. Spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe. Recommend followup chest
   CT in three months.
   Assessment and Plan

   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but possible hypoventilated [**1-5**] CHF exacerbation or oxygen
   narcosis. PE also could present similarly but patient was therapeutic
   on coumadin to OSH. No report of ingestions. Hypoxia improved with
   ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung parenchymal
   disease.  NOTE: MRSA pna is possible, compression of mainstem
   bronchous.

   TTE: TR Gradient 64-70, Pulmonic Valve Peak Gradient 39 mmHg.  The left
   and right atria are markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
   by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is a
   1cm mid-muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) with bidirectional
   flow. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
   global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
   the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral
   valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated,
   with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] A tricuspid
   valve annuloplasty ring is present with normal gradient. Moderate to
   severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. A well-seated pulmonic valve prosthesis
   is present. The gradient is high normal. No pulmonary regurgitation is
   seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Muscular ventricular septal defect with bidirectional flow.
   Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate to severe tricuspid
   regurgitation. Slightly increased pulmonic bioprosthetic gradient.
   Normal functioning mitral bioprosthesis.
   CT CHEST:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence for diffuse systemic lung disease such as interstitial
   lung disease. No fibrosis. No significant pulmonary edema.
   2. Small pleural effusions with relatively out of proportion bibasal
   atelectasis. This atelectasis could certainly compromise the limited
   reserve of this patient. Pneumonia may also coexist in this atelectatic
   lung.
   3. Right pulmonary artery dilatation compresses mainstem bronchi
   particulary onthe right which may also contribute to the limtied
   reserve.
   4. Pattern of ground glass nodulrity can be seen in primary pulmonary
   hypertension.
   5. Spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe. Recommend followup chest
   CT in three months.
   Assessment and Plan
   58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and repairs in
   [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and
   mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and
   surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on
   coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for
   continued management of heart failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but possible CHF exac, pulm HTN, MRSA PNA could have all
   contributed.  No report of aspiration. Hypoxia improved with
   ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung parenchymal
   disease.  NOTE: MRSA pna is possible, compression of mainstem
   bronchous.
   - Pulm will bronch in AM
 possible NO later.
   - wean vent as tolerate, goal sat lower, turn down peep and FiO2.
   Patient is hypercarbic at baseline.
   - PE is felt unlikely at this time; will defer CTA
   - f/u TSH
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology. Sv02 on admission 92 but unclear how
   to interpret given strong possibility of VSD/PFO.  Also CVP measured at
   16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. No
   lactate to indicated hypoperfusion. Maybe be hypovolemic [**1-5**]
   overdiuresis or hemotypsis. No WBC or fever to indicate underlying
   infection/septic shock. Certainly, cardiogenic shock is possible but
   need more data prior to definitely diagnosis.
   - wean levophed/dopamine as tolerated
   - goal I+O even, if patient hypotensive will consider addl fluid bolus
   (i/o even)
   - defer swan-ganz placement for now
   - trend hct
   .
   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum cx at OSH
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**])
   - f/u vanc level
   # Hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.
   - pulmonary bronch in am
   - hold anticoagulation
   - maintain active T+S
   - trend hct q8h, xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - f/u TTE
   - cont dopamine and levophed to titrate MAP>60
   - appreciate cardiothoracic surgery input re: valve integrity
   - hold diuresis
   - would benefit from beta blocker once hemodynamically stable
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation once hemoptysis improves
   .
   # ARF: Cr now improving s/p fluid bolus.  Urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.
   - trend Cr
   - improved on fluids last night, will continue to bolus prn
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Clinically, dry mucous membranes. Likely [**1-5**]
   hypovolemia in setting of recent diureses of 5-7L at OSH.
   - 1L NS bolus
   - trend serum lytes
   - hold diuresis
   - f/u TSH
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/Cef/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - trend eos
   - monitor for now
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved at OSH, not on heparin so HIT unlikely. No
   oozing from PIV.
   - f/u DIC labs
   - trend plts
   - xfuse plt<10 or <50k if bleeding

   # Anemia: Patient has a history of anemia, unclear baseline hct, also
   currently bleeding.
   - guaiac stools
   - f/u iron studies
   - trend hct q8h, xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries, including replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. He presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, hemoptysis, MRSA pneumonia, and signs of right ventricular failure.

Summary of Progress Notes:
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors, including CHF exacerbation, pulmonary hypertension, and MRSA pneumonia.
- The hypotension is of unclear etiology but may be related to hypovolemia or overdiuresis.
- Hemoptysis is ongoing, and a preliminary chest X-ray did not show any abnormalities. Possible causes include pneumonia, bronchiectasis, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, or cancer.
- The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension and worsening RV function.
- He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. His FiO2 is set at 50%, and his SpO2 is 97%.
- His blood gases show a PCO2 of 60s and a bicarb level in the 40s.
- He has a central line placed, and his fluid balance has been managed with fluid boluses and diuresis.
- His medications include vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia, fentanyl for"

   TTE: TR Gradient 64-70, Pulmonic Valve Peak Gradient 39 mmHg.  The left
   and right atria are markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
   by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is a
   1cm mid-muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) with bidirectional
   flow. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
   global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
   the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral
   valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated,
   with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] A tricuspid
   valve annuloplasty ring is present with normal gradient. Moderate to
   severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. A well-seated pulmonic valve prosthesis
   is present. The gradient is high normal. No pulmonary regurgitation is
   seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Muscular ventricular septal defect with bidirectional flow.
   Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Severe

   CT CHEST:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence for diffuse systemic lung disease such as interstitial
   lung disease. No fibrosis. No significant pulmonary edema.
   2. Small pleural effusions with relatively out of proportion bibasal
   atelectasis. This atelectasis could certainly compromise the limited
   reserve of this patient. Pneumonia may also coexist in this atelectatic
   lung.
   3. Right pulmonary artery dilatation compresses mainstem bronchi
   particulary onthe right which may also contribute to the limtied
   reserve.
   4. Pattern of ground glass nodulrity can be seen in primary pulmonary
   hypertension.
   5. Spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe. Recommend followup chest
   CT in three months.
   Assessment and Plan
   58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and repairs in
   [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and
   mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and
   surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on
   coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for
   continued management of heart failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but possible hypoventilated [**1-5**] CHF exacerbation or oxygen
   narcosis. PE also could present similarly but patient was therapeutic
   on coumadin to OSH. No report of ingestions. Hypoxia improved with
   ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung parenchymal
   disease.  NOTE: MRSA pna is possible, compression of mainstem
   bronchous.
   - Pulm will bronch in AM
 possible NO later.
   - wean vent as tolerate, goal sat lower, turn down peep and FiO2.
   - PE is felt unlikely at this time; will defer CTA
   - f/u TSH, vanc lvl (target 3 wks of vanc treatment).
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology. Sv02 on admission 92 but unclear how
   to interpret given strong possibility of VSD/PFO.  Also CVP measured at
   16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. No
   lactate to indicated hypoperfusion. Maybe be hypovolemic [**1-5**]
   overdiuresis or hemotypsis. No WBC or fever to indicate underlying
   infection/septic shock. Certainly, cardiogenic shock is possible but
   need more data prior to definitely diagnosis.
   - wean levophed/dopamine as tolerated
   - additional fluid bolus will be given as patient appears clinically
   dry (i/o even)
   - defer swan-ganz placement for now
   - hold antibiotics as no evidences of infection but follow up blood
   cultures
   - trend hct as below
   .
   # Hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.
   - f/u CXR am
   - f/u sputum Cx and gram stain
   - pulmonary bronch in am
   - hold anticoagulation
   - maintain active T+S
   - trend hct q8h, xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - eventually may proceed to RHC
   - f/u TTE
   - cont dopamine and levophed to titrate MAP>60
   - appreciate cardiothoracic surgery input re: valve integrity
   - hold diureses
   - would benefit from beta blocker once hemodynamically stable
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD on cath [**12-11**]. Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely [**1-5**] to ischemia.
   - f/u EKG
   - f/u cardiac enzymes
   - d/c ASA
   - continue statin
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation once hemoptysis improves
   .
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr unknown as last documented Cr here when patient
   was acutely ill. Cr now 1.8.  Urine lytes consistent with pre-renal
   etiology.
   - trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins if possible
   - improved on fluids last night, will continue to bolus prn
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Clinically, dry mucous membranes. Likely [**1-5**]
   hypovolemia in setting of recent diureses of 5-7L at OSH.
   - 1L NS bolus
   - trend serum lytes
   - hold diuresis
   - f/u TSH
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/Cef/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - trend eos
   - monitor for now
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved at OSH, not on heparin so HIT unlikely. No
   oozing from PIV.
   - f/u DIC labs
   - trend plts
   - xfuse plt<10 or <50k if bleeding

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgical repairs. He presents with hypotension, respiratory failure, hemoptysis, and a history of chronic atrial fibrillation. The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, and a history of diabetes and depression. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline hypercarbia with PCO2 in the 60s and bicarb in the 40s may lead to further respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The unclear etiology of the patient's hypotension requires further evaluation and management to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Hemoptysis: The presence of grossly bloody material from the endotracheal tube suggests possible causes such as pneumonia/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, or cancer. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Right ventricular failure: The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension and worsening right ventricular function may result in right ventricular failure if not properly managed.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The resolved thrombocytopenia requires monitoring and further investigation to determine the cause.
6. Anemia: The patient's history of anemia needs to be addressed and managed appropriately.
7. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes should be closely monitored and managed with appropriate medication and lifestyle modifications.
8. Depression/Anxiety: The patient's mental health conditions should be addressed and managed with appropriate medication and counseling.

Note: This summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note."

   disease. No fibrosis. No significant pulmonary edema.
   2. Small pleural effusions with relatively out of proportion bibasal
   atelectasis. This atelectasis could certainly compromise the limited

   Assessment and Plan
   58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and repairs in
   [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and
   mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and
   surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on
   coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for
   continued management of heart failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but possible hypoventilated [**1-5**] CHF exacerbation or oxygen
   narcosis. PE also could present similarly but patient was therapeutic
   on coumadin to OSH. No report of ingestions. Hypoxia improved with
   ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung parenchymal
   disease.
   - consider PA catheter/Right heart cath in am
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - PE is felt unlikely at this time; will defer CTA
   - f/u TTE results
   - f/u TSH
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology. Sv02 on admission 92 but unclear how
   to interpret given strong possibility of VSD/PFO.  Also CVP measured at
   16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. No
   lactate to indicated hypoperfusion. Maybe be hypovolemic [**1-5**]
   overdiuresis or hemotypsis. No WBC or fever to indicate underlying
   infection/septic shock. Certainly, cardiogenic shock is possible but
   need more data prior to definitely diagnosis.
   - wean levophed/dopamine as tolerated
   - additional fluid bolus will be given as patient appears clinically
   dry
   - defer swan-ganz placement for now
   - hold antibiotics as no evidences of infection but follow up blood
   cultures
   - trend hct as below

   # Hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.
   - f/u final CXR
   - f/u sputum Cx and gram stain
   - consult pulmonary in am
   - non-contrast chest CT

   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and subsequent surgical repairs, including replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. The patient has a background of CHF, DM, chronic AFib, and multiple GIB. He was transferred from OSH for continued management of heart failure.

The patient presented with hypotension, hypoxia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure etiology is unclear, but it could be due to CHF exacerbation, oxygen narcosis, or pulmonary embolism. The patient's SvO2 on admission was 92%, but the interpretation is unclear due to the possibility of VSD/PFO. The CVP measured at 16, but it may not accurately reflect the volume status/preload due to tricuspid regurgitation.

The patient also had grossly bloody material from the ET tube upon admission, which had been ongoing at OSH. This could be due to traumatic intubation or coumadin therapy. The preliminary CXR was unchanged, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, such as PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, or cancer.

The patient's baseline Cr was unknown, but the current Cr is 1.8, and the urine lytes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and subsequent surgical repairs, including valve replacements. He presents with multiple medical complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia and is on home oxygen for presumed pulmonary hypertension. The initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure etiology is unclear but likely secondary to pneumonia (PNA) in the setting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is no report of aspiration, and hypoxia improved with ventilation. The patient's gases have returned to baseline, and no known lung parenchymal disease was noted. MRSA PNA is possible due to compression of the mainstem bronchi.

2. Hypotension: The etiology of the hypotension is unclear. The SvO2 on admission was 92%, but the interpretation is uncertain given the possibility of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO). The CVP measured at 16, but due to tricuspid regurgitation (TR), it may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. There is no lactate to indicate hypoperfusion, suggesting that the patient may be hypovolemic due to overdiuresis or hemoptysis. Cardiogenic shock is also a possibility but needs more data prior to confirming the diagnosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including heart failure, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and possibly pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 88/38 mmHg (81/38-155/70), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg, and they have received a total of 3,970 mL of fluids since admission.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 9.5 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.2 g/dL, and elevated blood glucose level at 143 mg/dL. The patient's kidney function tests indicate a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and liver function tests show an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 28.8 U/L.

   Assessment and Plan
   58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and repairs in
   [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and
   mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and
   surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on
   coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for
   continued management of heart failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but most likely PNA in the setting of COPD.  No report of
   aspiration. Hypoxia improved with ventilation. Gases improved to
   baseline. No known lung parenchymal disease.  NOTE: MRSA pna is
   possible, compression of mainstem bronchous.
   - Bronch c/w PNA
   - sent for cultures and on vanc and cefepime, on albuterol and
   ipratropium.
   - wean vent as tolerate, goal sat lower, turn down peep and FiO2.
   Patient is hypercarbic at baseline.
   - PE is felt unlikely at this time; will defer CTA
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology. Sv02 on admission 92 but unclear how
   to interpret given strong possibility of VSD/PFO.  Also CVP measured at
   16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. No
   lactate to indicated hypoperfusion. Maybe be hypovolemic [**1-5**]
   overdiuresis or hemotypsis. No WBC or fever to indicate underlying
   infection/septic shock. Certainly, cardiogenic shock is possible but
   need more data prior to definitely diagnosis.
   - wean levophed/dopamine as tolerated
   - goal I+O even, if patient hypotensive will consider addl fluid bolus
   (i/o slightly positive)
   - trend hct
   .
   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum cx at OSH
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**]), added cefepime per bronch
   recs
   - f/u vanc level
   # Hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - hold anticoagulation
   - maintain active T+S
   - trend hct q8h, xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries, including replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. He presents with CHF, DM, chronic AFib, and multiple GIB. The patient is on home oxygen due to pulmonary hypertension and presents to the ICU for continued management of heart failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2 in the 60s and baseline bicarb in the 40s. The etiology for initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear but most likely PNA in the setting of COPD. There is no report of aspiration. Hypoxia improved with ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung parenchymal disease. The patient is hypercarbic at baseline.

2. Hypotension: Unclear etiology. SvO2 on admission was 92, but it is unclear how to interpret given the strong possibility of VSD/PFO. Also, CVP measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. No lactate to indicate hypoperfusion. Maybe be hypovolemic due to overdiuresis or hemoptysis. No WBC or fever to indicate underlying infection/septic shock. Certainly, cardiogenic shock is possible"

   - attempted to wean down FiO2, RR, but did not tolerate.
   - nutrition c/s - started tube feed.
   - CT: IMPRESSION: No evidence for diffuse systemic lung disease such as
   interstitial lung disease. No fibrosis. No significant pulmonary edema.
   Small pleural effusions with relatively out of proportion bibasal
   atelectasis. This atelectasis could certainly compromise the limited
   reserve of this patient. Pneumonia may also coexist in this atelectatic
   lung. Right pulmonary artery dilatation compresses mainstem bronchi
   particulary on the right which may also contribute to the limtied
   reserve. Pattern of ground glass nodulrity can be seen in primary
   pulmonary hypertension. Spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe.

   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but most likely PNA in the setting of COPD.  No report of
   aspiration. Hypoxia improved with ventilation. Gases improved to
   baseline. No known lung parenchymal disease.  NOTE: MRSA pna is
   possible, compression of mainstem bronchous.
   - Bronch c/w PNA
       - sent for cultures and on cefepime now, on albuterol and
   ipratropium.
   - wean vent as tolerate, goal sat lower, turn down peep and FiO2.
   Patient is hypercarbic at baseline.
   - PE is felt unlikely at this time; will defer CTA
   - f/u TSH

   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology. Sv02 on admission 92 but unclear how
   to interpret given strong possibility of VSD/PFO.  Also CVP measured at
   16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. No
   lactate to indicated hypoperfusion. Maybe be hypovolemic [**1-5**]
   overdiuresis or hemotypsis. No WBC or fever to indicate underlying
   infection/septic shock. Certainly, cardiogenic shock is possible but
   need more data prior to definitely diagnosis.
   - wean levophed/dopamine as tolerated
   - goal I+O even, if patient hypotensive will consider addl fluid bolus
   (i/o even)
   - defer swan-ganz placement for now
   - trend hct

   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum cx at OSH
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**]), added cefepime per bronch

   # Hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - hold anticoagulation
   - maintain active T+S
   - trend hct q8h, xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple repairs, including replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. He has chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, and depression/anxiety. The patient presented with hypotension, hypoxia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, hemoptysis, and renal failure. He was found to have MRSA pneumonia and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and fentanyl. He is also receiving nutrition through tube feeding. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 88/38 mmHg (81/49 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and a central venous pressure of 7 mmHg. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased hematocrit, creatinine, potassium, and sodium levels. His blood gases show a pH of 7.34, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 246, and bicarbonate level of 32 mEq/L. The patient's ECG shows atrial fibrillation, and the chest X-ray is unremarkable. 

The patient's assessment and plan include multiple medical complications such as hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, MRSA pneumonia, hemoptysis, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, depression/anxiety, and diabetes mellitus. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's heart failure, development of further lung infections, persistent renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia, and potential worsening of the patient's mental health status."

   Assessment and Plan
   58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and repairs in
   [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and
   mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and
   surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on
   coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for
   continued management of heart failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but most likely PNA in the setting of COPD.  No report of
   aspiration. Hypoxia improved with ventilation. Gases improved to
   baseline. No known lung parenchymal disease.  NOTE: MRSA pna is
   possible, compression of mainstem bronchous.
   - Bronch c/w PNA
   - sent for cultures and on vanc and cefepime, on albuterol and
   ipratropium.
   - wean vent as tolerate, goal sat lower, turn down peep and FiO2.
   Patient is hypercarbic at baseline.
   - PE is felt unlikely at this time; will defer CTA
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology. Sv02 on admission 92 but unclear how
   to interpret given strong possibility of VSD/PFO.  Also CVP measured at
   16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. No
   lactate to indicated hypoperfusion. Maybe be hypovolemic [**1-5**]
   overdiuresis or hemotypsis. No WBC or fever to indicate underlying
   infection/septic shock. Certainly, cardiogenic shock is possible but
   need more data prior to definitely diagnosis.
   - wean levophed/dopamine as tolerated
   - goal I+O even, if patient hypotensive will consider addl fluid bolus
   (i/o slightly positive)
   - trend hct
   .
   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum cx at OSH
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**]), added cefepime per bronch
   recs
   - f/u vanc level
   # Hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - hold anticoagulation
   - maintain active T+S
   - trend hct q8h, xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - f/u TTE
   - cont dopamine and levophed to titrate MAP>60
   - appreciate cardiothoracic surgery input re: valve integrity
   - hold diuresis
   - would benefit from beta blocker once hemodynamically stable
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation once hemoptysis improves
   .
   # ARF: Cr now improving s/p fluid bolus.  Urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.
   - trend Cr
   - improved on fluids last night, will continue to bolus prn

   # Hyponatremia: Clinically, dry mucous membranes. Likely [**1-5**]
   hypovolemia in setting of recent diureses of 5-7L at OSH.

   - trend serum lytes
   - hold diuresis
   - f/u TSH

   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - trend eos

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient has a history of congenital heart disease and has undergone multiple surgeries to repair various heart defects. The patient is currently in the ICU for management of heart failure and is on home oxygen due to pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with elevated PCO2 levels in the 60s and a history of COPD. The etiology of the initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but it is most likely due to pneumonia (PNA) in the setting of COPD. There is no report of aspiration, and hypoxia improved with ventilation. The patient's gases improved to baseline, and no known lung parenchymal disease was identified. 

2. Hypotension: The cause of the patient's hypotension is unclear. SvO2 on admission was 92%, but it is unclear how to interpret this due to the possibility of VSD/PFO. CVP measured at 16 but may not accurately reflect volume status/preload due to tricuspid regurgitation. No lactate is present to indicate hypoperfusion. The patient may be hypovolemic from overdiuresis or hemoptysis. No white blood cell count or fever is present to indicate underlying infection/septic shock. Cardiogenic shock is also possible but requires more data before a definitive diagnosis.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgical repairs.
- He has been admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, and multiple infections.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, but has tolerated a FiO2 of 35% and is being weaned off assisted ventilation.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 125/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for gross hemoptysis upon admission.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin T levels.
- The patient has several medical complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, MRSA pneumonia, hemoptysis, pulmonary hypertension, and thrombocytopenia.
- He is currently receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedation, and pressor support.
- The patient's care plan includes weaning off the ventilator, managing his blood pressure and fluid status, treating MRSA pneumonia, investigating the cause of hemoptysis, and addressing other medical issues such as eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diabetes, and thrush.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's baseline hypercarbia and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and dependence on vasopressor support suggest a potential risk of hemodynamic instability. Frequent assessment of blood pressure and heart rate is required, along with careful management of fluid and medication administration.
3. Infection: The patient has already been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and may be at risk for additional infections due to his immunocompromised state and invasive lines. Regular assessment of vital signs, chest x-rays, and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any new infections promptly.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of hemoptysis and ongoing bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube pose a risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding and appropriate management, including holding anticoagulation, are essential.
5. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension and evidence of right ventricular dysfunction indicate a risk of further deterioration. Continuous monitoring of cardiac function and appropriate management, including inotropic support and diuresis, are important.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of platelet counts and careful management of anticoagulation and invasive procedures are necessary.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current medical complications require close monitoring and multidisciplinary care to manage his acute issues and prevent potential complications."

The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease, including repairs to his pulmonic, mitral, and tricuspid valves. He also has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. The patient was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and an MRSA-positive sputum culture. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His recent lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and lactate, as well as low hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient has a complex medical history, with multiple comorbidities and recent complications such as hemoptysis, acute anemia, thrombocytopenia, and eosinophilia.

Potential Medical Complications:

   unclear but most [**Name (NI) 10842**] PNA.  No report of aspiration. Hypoxia
   improved with ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung
   parenchymal disease.
   - Bronch c/w PNA
   - sent for cultures and on vanc and cefepime, on albuterol and
   ipratropium.
   - wean vent as tolerated.  Patient is hypercarbic at baseline but
   appears to be hyperventilating at this time (alkalemic on last ABG with
   pCO2=43).  Will increase FiO2 in case oxygen drive is causing
   hyperventilation.

   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient has
   been repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.

   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries to repair his heart valves. He has been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a baseline hypercarbia (elevated CO2 levels) and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. His initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is believed to be due to pneumonia (PNA), but there is no report of aspiration. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in his gases. Bronchoscopy revealed bronchitis consistent with PNA, and cultures are pending. He is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. His central venous pressure (CVP) is measured at 16, but the accuracy of this measurement is uncertain. No signs of pre-renal insufficiency are present, and his pressor requirements have decreased after fluid repletion. The goal is to wean off pressors as tolerated.

3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has MRSA in his sputum culture, and his sputum culture here also grew coagulase-positive Staphylococcus. He is being treated with vancomycin for three weeks and has been added on cefepime based on bronchoscopic"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a baseline hypercarbia with increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This can be due to underlying lung disease or poor respiratory function.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be caused by hypovolemia (low blood volume) or distributive shock. There is also a possibility of ongoing fluid losses and pre-renal insufficiency.

3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has an infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which may require extended treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

4. Acute Hematocrit Drop: The patient's hematocrit levels are dropping acutely, indicating a possible blood loss or hemolysis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

5. Hemoptysis: The patient has experienced grossly bloody material from the endotracheal tube, which could be due to trauma during intubation or bleeding related to coagulopathy.

6. Right Ventricular Failure: The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension and congenital heart disease suggests that right ventricular failure may be worsening. This could be caused by pulmonary hypertension, valvular issues, or infective endocarditis.

7. Eosinophilia and Drug Eruption: The patient has an elevated eosinophil count and a diffuse ery"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries to repair his heart valves. He has a background of congestive heart failure, diabetes, chronic atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure and was placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been on pressors for hypotension, but these have been gradually reduced as his condition improved. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. He also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, and a diffuse erythematous rash, which is suspected to be a drug eruption. The patient's renal function and electrolytes are being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a baseline hypercarbia, and it is essential to continue monitoring his respiratory status and adjusting ventilator settings accordingly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management are necessary. The use of pressors may be required if hypotension persists.
3. MRSA pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, and his treatment regimen includes vancomycin and cefepime. It is crucial to monitor his response to antibiotics and ensure adequate source"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgical repairs. He was admitted for continued management of heart failure. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, hypotension, MRSA pneumonia, acute anemia, hemoptysis, right ventricular failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diabetes, thrush, depression/anxiety, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a baseline hypercarbia with elevated PCO2 levels in the 60s and a baseline bicarb in the 40s. This indicates difficulty in eliminating carbon dioxide from the body, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. This can compromise organ perfusion and lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.

3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, which is a type of bacterial infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. If left untreated, it can worsen the respiratory failure and cause sepsis.

4. Acute Anemia: The patient has experienced a sudden drop in hemoglobin levels, indicating acute anemia. This can result in inadequate oxygen delivery"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries, including replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. He presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, MRSA pneumonia, acute Hct drop, hemoptysis, and evidence of right ventricular (RV) failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with a PCO2 in the 60s and bicarb in the 40s. This condition may progress if not properly managed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

3. MRSA PNA: The patient has MRSA pneumonia, which requires appropriate antibiotic treatment. If not effectively managed, it can lead to worsening of the infection and potentially spread to other areas.

4. Acute Hct drop: The patient has experienced an acute drop in hematocrit (Hct), indicating possible bleeding or hemolysis. It is important to identify the source of bleeding and provide appropriate treatment.

5. Hemoptysis: The patient has grossly bloody material from the endotracheal (ET) tube. Although the preliminary chest X-ray is unchanged,"

   unclear but most [**Name (NI) 10842**] PNA.  No report of aspiration. Hypoxia
   improved with ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung
   parenchymal disease.  Sputum cx here (+) for MRSA.
   - Bronch c/w PNA.
   - sent for cultures and on vanc and cefepime, on albuterol and

   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.  No continued
   bloody secretions from ET tube.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - suction / oral care as needed
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries, including valve replacements, closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO), and surgical repair of tricuspid valve. He has been admitted with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, MRSA pneumonia, acute drop in hematocrit (Hct), hemoptysis, pulmonary hypertension, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and thrush. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving multiple medications including vasopressors, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent complications such as hypoxemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased intracranial pressure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. MRSA Pneumonia: The presence of MRSA pneumonia increases the risk of healthcare-associated infections and can lead"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgical repairs. He was admitted for management of heart failure and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, MRSA pneumonia, acute hemolytic anemia, and other medical complications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 104/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The FiO2 is set at 40% and the PEEP is at 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, Hct levels, and PT/PTT/INR. There are also abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and cardiac enzymes. The patient has eosinophilia and thrombocytopenia, which have since resolved.

The patient's medical history includes chronic atrial fibrillation, multiple gastrointestinal bleeding episodes, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic heart failure. He is on multiple medications including anticoagulants, beta blockers, diuretics, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with increased levels of carbon dioxide (PCO2) in their blood. This condition can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. It is important to monitor the patient's vital signs and consider fluid resuscitation if necessary.

3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, which requires appropriate antibiotic treatment. This can be a serious complication if not promptly addressed.

4. Acute Hct Drop: The patient has experienced a sudden drop in hematocrit levels, indicating possible bleeding or hemolysis. Further investigation and monitoring are needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

5. Hemoptysis: The patient has grossly bloody material from the endotracheal tube, which could be due to traumatic intubation or an underlying lung condition. It is important to evaluate and manage this symptom to prevent further complications.

6. Right Ventricular Failure: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline right ventricular (RV) failure. Worsening RV failure can occur due to various factors such as pulmonary hypertension, valvular deterioration, or infective endocarditis. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to a medical condition. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. The patient underwent failed extubation and was subsequently reintubated with a new OG tube placed. The patient's pulmonary function is being monitored through a tracheostomy (pulm rec: trach). 

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) was repeated and found to be at a previous level without the need for a transfusion, and the held packed red blood cells (prbc) were returned. The patient's blood sugar level (stim) was normal, and a bowel movement has not yet occurred. 

The patient received Tylenol and fluid boluses, as well as a blood transfusion of 1 unit. The patient's allergies include Aldactone (Oral) (Spironolactone), with an unknown reaction described as gynact. 

The patient is currently on several medications, including norepinephrine, pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient also received midazolam (Versed) at 05:22 AM on 10/19/2201.

The patient's medical and family history has not been updated since admission. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but most [**Name (NI) 10842**] PNA.  No report of aspiration. Hypoxia
   improved with ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung
   parenchymal disease.  Sputum cx here (+) for MRSA.
   - Bronch c/w PNA.
   - sent for cultures and on vanc and cefepime, on albuterol and
   ipratropium.

   # Hypotension: Could be [**1-5**] hypovolemia +/- distributive shock.  CVP
   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient has
   been repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.
   - now off pressors

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and surgical repairs, chronic atrial fibrillation, and multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and MRSA pneumonia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has required multiple pressors for hemodynamic stability. He is currently off pressors and tolerating spontaneous breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a baseline hypercarbia with elevated PCO2 levels in the 60s. It is important to closely monitor his respiratory status and adjust ventilation parameters as necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia, distributive shock, or cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring of his blood pressure and fluid balance is essential. Additional diagnostic tests such as echocardiography may be required to evaluate cardiac function.
3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has an active MRSA infection in his sputum culture. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and close monitoring of clinical response and culture results is necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which has resolved since admission. Regular monitoring of platelet counts is important to detect any recurrence of low platelet"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries to repair his heart valves. He is currently in the ICU for management of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, MRSA pneumonia, acute hematocrit drop, hemoptysis, pulmonary hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diabetes, thrush, depression/anxiety, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with increased PCO2 levels. This can be due to various reasons such as respiratory muscle weakness, obstruction of the airway, or inadequate ventilation. Immediate intervention is necessary to improve oxygenation and remove carbon dioxide from the body.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be caused by hypovolemia, distributive shock, or a combination of both. Close monitoring of fluid balance and appropriate fluid resuscitation are required to maintain adequate perfusion.

3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Antibiotic therapy needs to be adjusted based on culture and sensitivity results. In addition, proper infection control measures should be implemented to prevent the spread of MRSA within the hospital.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a complex medical history including congenital heart disease and subsequent repairs, chronic atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure and acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a baseline elevated carbon dioxide level and bicarbonate level. He is receiving oxygen therapy at home for presumed pulmonary hypertension. The etiology of the initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but it is suspected to be due to a pulmonary infection. The patient is being treated with albuterol, ipratropium, vancomycin, and cefepime for MRSA pneumonia. He is currently tolerating pressure support and may be considered for extubation today.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. Central venous pressure (CVP) measurement shows 16, but it may not accurately reflect the patient's volume status or preload. The patient has been repleted with 5 liters of fluid since admission, resulting in a substantial decrease in pressor requirement and resolution of pre-renal insufficiency. The patient is now off pressors, and additional fluid bolus may be considered if the patient is hypotensive.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries to repair valves and close VSD and PFO.
- He has a background of CHF, DM, chronic AFib, and multiple gastrointestinal bleeding episodes.
- The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure and suspected pneumonia.
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 108/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen.
- The patient is intubated and on SIMV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 27 mmHg, with positive fluid balance since 12 AM.
- His blood glucose level is elevated at 152 mg/dL.
- Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 266 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.8 g/dL, sodium (Na+) of 141 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 5.4 mEq/L, and creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL.
- The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and is receiving appropriate antibiotics.
- He has been weaned off pressors and has shown improvement in his condition.
- The patient's hemoptysis has resolved, but he still has an acute drop in Hct since admission, with no clear source of bleeding identified.
- He is at risk for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to his chronic AFib and previous episodes of hypercarbia.
- The patient's eosinophilia is likely due to a drug reaction.
- He has a history of thrombocytopenia but is now improving.
- The patient's anemia may be related to chronic blood loss.
- He requires ongoing management for his diabetes and depression/anxiety.
- The patient is scheduled for a tracheostomy and weaning off mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic AFib and previous episodes of hypercarbia. This increases his risk for hypercarbic respiratory failure, especially if he becomes less compliant with his ventilation settings or if his pulmonary function deteriorates further.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated and on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The patient's recent diagnosis of MRSA pneumonia suggests that he may be at higher risk for developing VAP.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of multiple gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. Even though his hem"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries for valve replacements. He has been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions and complications.

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with a PCO2 in the 60s and baseline bicarb in the 40s. This condition is likely due to an initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly caused by pneumonia (PNA). The patient's sputum culture was positive for MRSA, and he is currently receiving vancomycin and cefepime. Daily weaning trials and respiratory support are being provided.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. His central venous pressure (CVP) is measured at 16, but it may not accurately reflect the volume status or preload. There are no signs of lactate indicating hypoperfusion. The patient has been repleted with 5 liters of fluid since admission, resulting in a substantial decrease in pressor requirements and resolution of pre-renal insufficiency. He is currently off pressors, and his I/O is slightly positive. The goal is to maintain even I/O, with consideration for additional fluid bolus if the patient is hypotensive.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries to repair various heart valves. He was admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with increased carbon dioxide levels and a history of presumed pulmonary hypertension. The initial cause of acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but it is most likely due to pneumonia. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for MRSA pneumonia and is on mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. Despite a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16, the accuracy of this measurement is uncertain due to tricuspid regurgitation. There are no signs of hypoperfusion, and the patient has been repleted with fluids, resulting in a decrease in pressor requirement and resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.

3. MRSA pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed MRSA infection in the sputum culture. He is currently receiving vancomycin therapy for three weeks and has also been started on cefepime per bronchoscopic recommendations. 

4. Acute hemoglobin drop: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and subsequent repairs, as well as chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. He was transferred to the ICU for management of heart failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, chronic atrial fibrillation, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently on home oxygen for presumed pulmonary hypertension.

The patient presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, and his initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but most likely due to a pneumonia (PNA). He is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime, along with albuterol and ipratropium. The patient has been weaned off pressors and is now hemodynamically stable.

The patient also has hypotension, which could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. His central venous pressure (CVP) is measured at 16, but given the tricuspid regurgitation, it may not accurately reflect his volume status or preload. The patient has been repleted with fluids since admission, resulting in a substantial decrease in pressor requirement and resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.

Furthermore, the patient has methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He was started on vancomycin for three weeks, and cefepime was added per bronchoscopic recommendations. No indications for atypical coverage at this time"

   mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and
   surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on
   coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for
   continued management of heart failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but most [**Name (NI) 10842**] PNA.  No report of aspiration. Hypoxia
   improved with ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung
   parenchymal disease.  Sputum cx here (+) for MRSA PNA.
   - on vanc D6/21 and cefepime D2/8, on albuterol and ipratropium.
   - daily rsbi and PSV, wean trials.
   - on trach

   # Hypotension: Could be [**1-5**] hypovolemia +/- distributive shock.  CVP
   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient has
   been repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.
   - now off pressors
   - goal I+O even, if patient hypotensive will consider addl fluid bolus
   (i/o slightly positive)

   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum cx at OSH.  Sputum cx here
   grew out coag + Staph, [**Last Name (un) **] pending.
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**]), added cefepime per bronch
   recs.  No indications for atypical coverage at this time.
   - f/u daily vanc level, was reduced to 750 daily.
   - PICC today
   # acute Hct drop
 downtrending since admission.  No clear source of
   bleeding as hemoptysis has resolved.  Patient has a history of anemia,
   unclear baseline hct.
   - transfuse 1u pRBC, f/u hct
   - hemolysis labs, B12, folate wnl
 no source found
   - xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   - needs o/p work-up
   .
   # hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.  No continued
   bloody secretions from ET tube.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - suction / oral care as needed
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - hold diuresis
   - beta blocker
   - keep even
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation once hemoptysis improves
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/CTX/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - resolving now off CTX/clindamycin

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:

   Agree with recorded exam
   Medical Decision Making
   Respiratory failure. Do not think that cardiac shunt or valvular
   disease is a major contributor at this time.  Will plan to maintain
   volume status and continue respiratory therapy and other plan as
   above.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple repairs, including replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. He also has a history of CHF, DM, chronic AF on coumadin, and multiple GIB. The patient was transferred from OSH for continued management of heart failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, MRSA PNA, acute Hct drop, hemoptysis, PUMP (pulmonary hypertension and RV failure), rhythm (chronic AF), eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes, thrush, and depression/anxiety. He is currently on various medications including Aldactone, Cefepime, Vancomycin, Pantoprazole, Fentanyl, Heparin Sodium, and Midazolam.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/45 mmHg to 126/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His CVP is 15 mmHg, and his fluid balance is positive with a total input of 958 mL and output of 717 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 6.3 K/uL, Hct of 24.7%, Plt of 274 K/uL, Cr of 1.3 mg/dL, TCO2 of 30, Glucose of 152 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals intubation, responsive and interactive, with no appreciable rales. His heart rhythm is irregular, and he has 2+ pulses bilaterally. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and nondistended. Other findings include a wound care note, a nutrition consult, and plans for tracheostomy rehabilitation and consolidation of outpatient medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, persistent hypotension, ongoing MRSA infection, further drop in Hct, persistent hemoptysis, progression of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure, continued arrhythmias, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, uncontrolled diabetes, thrush, and worsening depression/anxiety."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgical repairs. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, and presumed pulmonary hypertension. His current medications include coumadin, albuterol, ipratropium, vancomycin, and cefepime.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/45-126/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in SIMV/PSV mode.

The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, acute hematocrit drop, hemoptysis, and right ventricular (RV) failure. His current assessments and plans include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a baseline hypercarbia with PCO2 in the 60s and baseline bicarb in the 40s. He is being managed with ventilation and daily spontaneous breathing trials.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. His central venous pressure (CVP) is measured at 16, but it may not accurately reflect volume status/preload. No lactate levels indicate hypoperfusion. The patient has been repleted with fluids, resulting in a substantial decrease in pressor requirement and resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.

3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has MRSA in his sputum culture. He is receiving vancomycin for 3 weeks and cefepime per bronchoscopic recommendations. Atypical coverage is not indicated at this time.

4. Acute hematocrit drop: The patient has experienced a downtrending hematocrit since admission. No clear source of bleeding has been identified, and his baseline hematocrit is unclear. He has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), and further evaluation is needed.

5. Hemoptysis: The patient had grossly bloody material from the endotracheal (ET) tube upon admission. This may have been due to traumatic intubation or coumadin use. No continued bloody secretions from the ET tube have been observed.

6. Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure: The patient presented with hypotension and an echocardiogram showing elevated pulmonary artery pressures consistent with worsened RV failure. His pulmonary hypertension is likely due to worsening valvular regurgitation or infective endocarditis.

7. Chronic atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled and monitored closely. Anticoagulation is resumed once hem"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple repairs. He has been admitted to the ICU for continued management of heart failure. The patient has several medical complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia and is on home oxygen for presumed pulmonary hypertension. The initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but most likely due to a pneumonia (PNA). There is no report of aspiration, and hypoxia improved with ventilation. The patient's sputum culture grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for which he is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. His central venous pressure (CVP) is measured at 16, but given the tracheostomy, it may not accurately reflect the volume status or preload. The patient has been repleted with fluids, resulting in a substantial decrease in pressor requirements and resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.

3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has MRSA pneumonia, as evidenced by the positive sputum culture. He is being treated with vancomycin for 3 weeks and has also been started on cefepime per bronchial recommendations.

4. Acute Hct Drop: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease, including multiple surgeries and valve replacements. He has chronic atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy. The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure, but upon arrival, he was found to have acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to an MRSA pneumonia. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical conditions include chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic atrial fibrillation. He also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. His current medications include albuterol, ipratropium, vancomycin, cefepime, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Physical examination findings include hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypotension, tachycardia, and an irregular heart rhythm. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profiles. Imaging studies reveal evidence of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to MRSA pneumonia. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory support.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which could be attributed to hypovolemia, distributive shock,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries for valve repairs.
- He has been admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and MRSA pneumonia.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and his gases have improved to baseline levels.
- His hypotension is attributed to possible hypovolemia and distributive shock, but the central venous pressure (CVP) may not accurately reflect his volume status.
- The patient has been repleted with fluids, which has resulted in a substantial decrease in pressor requirement and resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.
- His MRSA pneumonia is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime.
- The patient also has an acute drop in hemoglobin (Hct), but no clear source of bleeding has been identified.
- He is transfused with packed red blood cells (pRBC) and further investigation for hemolysis is ongoing.
- The patient's hemoptysis has resolved, but he had grossly bloody material from the endotracheal (ET) tube upon admission.
- He has a history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline right ventricular (RV) failure.
- His pulmonary hypertension is likely worsening due to pulmonary hypertension itself or valvular deterioration.

   Assessment and Plan
   58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and repairs in
   [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and
   mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and
   surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on
   coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for
   continued management of heart failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but most [**Name (NI) 10842**] PNA.  No report of aspiration. Hypoxia
   improved with ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung
   parenchymal disease.  Sputum cx here (+) for MRSA PNA.
   - on vanc D8/21 and cefepime D7/8, on albuterol and ipratropium.
   - daily rsbi and PSV, wean trials.
   - on trach
   - f/u IP rec
   .
   # Hypotension: Could be [**1-5**] hypovolemia +/- distributive shock.  CVP
   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient has
   been repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.
   - now off pressors
   - goal I+O even, if patient hypotensive will consider addl fluid bolus
   (i/o slightly positive)
   - trend hct
   .
   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum cx at OSH.  Sputum cx here
   grew out coag + Staph, [**Last Name (un) **] pending.
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**]), added cefepime per bronch
   recs.  No indications for atypical coverage at this time.
   - f/u daily vanc level, was reduced to 750 daily.
   - PICC today
   # acute Hct drop
 downtrending since admission.  No clear source of
   bleeding as hemoptysis has resolved.  Patient has a history of anemia,
   unclear baseline hct.
   - transfuse 1u pRBC, f/u hct
   - hemolysis labs, B12, folate wnl
 no source found
   - xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   - needs o/p work-up
   .
   # hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.  No continued
   bloody secretions from ET tube.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - suction / oral care as needed
   .
   # ARF: Cr elevated this AM 1.5.  Unclear what baseline Cr is; trough Cr
   during this hospitalization is 1.0.  No acute elevation in BUN.
   - send urine electrolytes
   - dose vanc renally
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - hold diuresis
   - beta blocker
   - keep even
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation once hemoptysis improves
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/CTX/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - resolving now off CTX/clindamycin
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved at OSH, not on heparin so HIT unlikely. No
   oozing from PIV.
   - significantly improved since admission; ?drug rxn from abx

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries to repair his heart valves. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure and chronic atrial fibrillation. The patient has several medical complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, MRSA pneumonia, acute hemolysis, hemoptysis, acute renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely due to his underlying pulmonary hypertension and may be exacerbated by his recent MRSA pneumonia. His hypotension could be attributed to hypovolemia or distributive shock, but further evaluation is needed as the central venous pressure (CVP) measurements may not accurately reflect his volume status. 

The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, for which he is receiving vancomycin and cefepime. His acute hemolysis has resolved, but the cause remains unclear. The patient also experienced hemoptysis upon admission, which has since resolved. 

His acute renal failure is characterized by an elevated creatinine level, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. The patient's pulmonary hypertension may have worsened due to right ventricular failure, possibly as a result of his underlying congenital heart disease or infective endocarditis. 

The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation is well-documented, and he is currently anticoagulated. He also exhibits eosinophilia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries including valve replacements, closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO), and surgical repair of tricuspid valve. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with elevated PCO2 in the 60s and baseline bicarb in the 40s. The etiology for the initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but most likely due to pneumonia (PNA). The patient is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for MRSA PNA. Daily respiratory system compliance and pressure support ventilation (PSV) weaning trials are being performed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be caused by hypovolemia or distributive shock. Central venous pressure (CVP) measurement at 16 indicates adequate volume status, but transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may not accurately reflect preload due to the presence of a tracheostomy tube. The patient has been repleted with fluids, leading to a"

","The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries for valve replacements and repair of congenital defects. He has chronic atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin. He also has diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and depression/anxiety. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, hypotension, anemia, hemoptysis, and right ventricular (RV) failure.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Acute Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a baseline hypercarbia with increased PCO2 levels in the 60s and bicarbonate levels in the 40s. He is on home oxygen for presumed pulmonary hypertension. The etiology of the initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but it is likely related to a previous pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and repairs in
   [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and
   mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and
   surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on
   coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for
   continued management of heart failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but most [**Name (NI) 10842**] PNA.  No report of aspiration. Hypoxia
   improved with ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung
   parenchymal disease.  Sputum cx here (+) for MRSA PNA.
   - on vanc D8/21 and cefepime D4/8, on albuterol and ipratropium.
   - daily rsbi and PSV, wean trials.
   - on trach
   - f/u IP rec
   - continued on fluconazole D4/7 (thrush)
   .
   # ARF: Cr elevated this AM 1.5.  Unclear what baseline Cr is; trough Cr
   during this hospitalization is 1.0.  No acute elevation in BUN.  Likely
   pre-renal, will need to rehydrate.
   - continue maintenance, give IVF bolus throughout the day.
   - dose vanc renally 1g Q48H
   .
   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum cx at OSH.  Sputum cx here
   grew out coag + Staph, [**Last Name (un) **] pending.
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**]), added cefepime per bronch
   recs.  No indications for atypical coverage at this time.
   - f/u daily vanc level, was reduced to 1g q 48h.
   - PICC today
   .
   # Hypotension: Could be [**1-5**] hypovolemia +/- distributive shock.  CVP
   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient has
   been repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.
   - now off pressors
   - goal I+O even, if patient hypotensive will consider addl fluid bolus
   (i/o slightly positive)
   - trend hct
   .
   # acute Hct drop
 downtrending since admission.  No clear source of
   bleeding as hemoptysis has resolved.  Patient has a history of anemia,
   unclear baseline hct.
   - transfuse 1u pRBC, f/u hct
   - hemolysis labs, B12, folate wnl
 no source found
   - xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   - needs o/p work-up
   .
   # hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.  No continued
   bloody secretions from ET tube.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - suction / oral care as needed
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - hold diuresis
   - beta blocker
   - keep even to slightly positive
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation once hemoptysis improves
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/CTX/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - resolving now off CTX/clindamycin
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved at OSH, not on heparin so HIT unlikely. No
   oozing from PIV.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgical repairs, including replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with elevated PCO2 in the 60s and baseline bicarb in the 40s. Hypoxia improved with ventilation, and gases returned to baseline. No known lung parenchymal disease is present, but there is a positive sputum culture for MRSA pneumonia.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.5, but the baseline creatinine is unclear. There is no acute elevation in BUN, suggesting pre-renal azotemia. The patient needs to be rehydrated, and maintenance fluids should be continued with IV fluid boluses throughout the day.

3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has a sputum culture positive for MRSA, and appropriate antibiotics have been initiated. Vancomycin has been started for three weeks, and cefepime has been added based on bronchoscopic recommendations.

   Assessment and Plan
   58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and repairs in
   [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and
   mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and
   surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on
   coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for
   continued management of heart failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure
   unclear but most [**Name (NI) 10842**] PNA.  No report of aspiration. Hypoxia
   improved with ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung
   parenchymal disease.  Sputum cx here (+) for MRSA PNA.
   - on vanc D10/21, on albuterol and ipratropium.  Completed 8 day course
   of cefepime.
   - daily rsbi and PSV, wean trials, on trach
   - f/u IP rec
   - continued on fluconazole D5/7 (thrush)
   .
   # ARF: Cr elevated this AM 1.5.  Unclear what baseline Cr is; trough Cr
   during this hospitalization is 1.0.  No acute elevation in BUN.  Likely
   pre-renal, will need to rehydrate.
   - continue maintenance, give IVF bolus throughout the day.
   - Increase free water flushes with tube feeds.
   - dose vanc renally 1g Q48H
   .
   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum cx at OSH.  Sputum cx here
   grew out coag + Staph, [**Last Name (un) **] pending.
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**]), added cefepime per bronch
   recs.  No indications for atypical coverage at this time.
   - f/u daily vanc level, was reduced to 1g q 48h.
   - PICC today
   .
   # Hypotension: Could be [**1-5**] hypovolemia +/- distributive shock.  CVP
   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient has
   been repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.
   - now off pressors
   - goal I+O even, if patient hypotensive will consider addl fluid bolus
   (i/o slightly positive)
   - trend hct
   .
   # acute Hct drop
 downtrending since admission.  No clear source of
   bleeding as hemoptysis has resolved.  Patient has a history of anemia,
   unclear baseline hct.
   - transfuse 1u pRBC, f/u hct
   - hemolysis labs, B12, folate wnl
 no source found
   - xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   - needs o/p work-up
   .
   # hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.  No continued
   bloody secretions from ET tube.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - suction / oral care as needed
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - hold diuresis
   - beta blocker
   - keep even to slightly positive
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation once hemoptysis improves
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/CTX/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - resolving now off CTX/clindamycin
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved at OSH, not on heparin so HIT unlikely. No
   oozing from PIV.
   - significantly improved since admission; ?drug rxn from abx

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple repairs, including pulmonic and mitral valve replacements, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. He presents with chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to an acute pneumonia (PNA) with an identified MRSA infection. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime. The patient's initial hypoxia improved with ventilation, and his gases returned to baseline levels. No known lung parenchymal disease was noted.

The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline right ventricular (RV) failure, which is likely contributing to his current presentation. His worsening RV function may be due to worsening VSD or mitral regurgitation, or possibly worsening tricuspid regurgitation. No evidence of an RV infarct was observed.

The patient's renal function has been impaired, with an elevated creatinine level of 1.5. This is likely pre-renal in origin, possibly due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. He has been repleted with 5 liters of fluids since admission, leading to a substantial decrease in pressor requirement and resolution of pre-"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple repairs, including valve replacements. He has a background of chronic atrial fibrillation, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient was admitted for management of heart failure and respiratory failure. He presented with hypotension and acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly due to pulmonary hypertension. The patient also had acute kidney injury, likely pre-renal, and was found to have MRSA pneumonia. He experienced hemoptysis and had a significant drop in hemoglobin, which was initially attributed to bleeding but later determined to be unrelated. The patient's condition improved with continued management, and he was weaned off pressors and ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, which could be attributed to pulmonary hypertension or an atypical infection. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient exhibited signs of acute kidney injury, possibly pre-renal in nature. Rehydration and careful management of fluid balance are necessary to prevent further renal dysfunction.
3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient was found to have MRSA pneumonia. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of treatment failure or worsening infection.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which may"

   during this hospitalization is 1.0.  No acute elevation in BUN.  Likely
   pre-renal, will need to rehydrate.
   - continue maintenance, give IVF bolus throughout the day.

   # Hypotension: Could be [**1-5**] hypovolemia +/- distributive shock.  CVP
   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient has
   been repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.
   - now off pressors

   # hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.  No continued
   bloody secretions from ET tube.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - suction / oral care as needed
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.

   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/CTX/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and various surgical repairs. He is currently in the ICU for management of heart failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, and multiple gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is on home oxygen due to presumed pulmonary hypertension. The patient was transferred from another hospital for continued management of his heart failure.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with a PCO2 in the 60s and a baseline bicarb in the 40s. He is on O2 at home for presumed pulmonary hypertension. The etiology of the initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but most likely it is a pneumonia (PNA). There is no report of aspiration. Hypoxia improved with ventilation. Gases improved to baseline. No known lung parenchymal disease. Sputum culture grew MRSA, and the patient is currently on vancomycin and cefepime.

2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine is elevated this morning at 1.5. It is unclear what the baseline creatinine is; trough creatinine during this hospitalization is 1.0. There is no acute elevation in BUN. It is likely pre-renal, so the patient needs to be rehydrated.

3. MRSA pneumonia: The patient has MRSA in his sputum"

   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure MRSA
   PNA.  Hypoxia has improved with ventilation.  Sputum cx and BAL here
   (+) for MRSA PNA.

   during this hospitalization is 1.0.  No acute elevation in BUN.  Likely
   pre-renal as has resolved with fluids.
   - PRN boluses.
   - free water flushes with tube feeds.
   - dose vanc renally 1g Q48H
   .
   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**] end [**11-4**]), completed cefepime
   per bronch recs.  No indications for atypical coverage at this time.
   - f/u daily vanc level, reduced to 1g q 48h.
   - PICC today

   # Hypotension: Could be [**1-5**] hypovolemia +/- distributive shock.  CVP
   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient was
   repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.
   - now off pressors, tolerating BB
   - trend hct

   # hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.  No continued
   bloody secretions from ET tube.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - suction / oral care as needed
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - hold diuresis

   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation

   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/CTX/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - resolving now off CTX/clindamycin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a complex medical history including congenital heart disease, multiple surgeries, chronic atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. He was admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure and acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, which was likely due to a previous pneumonia (PNA) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (ARF): His creatinine levels are elevated, and there is uncertainty about his baseline creatinine level. It is likely pre-renal in nature, and he needs to be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Renal dosing for vancomycin should be adjusted accordingly.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. His central venous pressure (CVP) is measured at 16 but may not accurately reflect his volume status or preload. He has been repleted with fluids, leading to a decrease in pressor requirement and resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity: The patient has swelling and edema in his left upper extremity, which is concerning for a possible DVT. An ultrasound of the affected limb should be considered, and anticoagulation with warfarin should be"

   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure MRSA
   PNA.  Hypoxia has improved with ventilation.  Sputum cx and BAL here
   (+) for MRSA PNA.  Status post trach.
   - on vanc last day [**11-4**], on albuterol and ipratropium.  Completed 8 day
   course of cefepime.
   - daily rsbi and PSV, wean trials, on trach
   - continued on fluconazole D7/7 (thrush)

   # ARF: Cr elevated this AM 1.5.  Unclear what baseline Cr is; trough Cr
   during this hospitalization is 1.0.  No acute elevation in BUN.  Likely
   pre-renal as has resolved with fluids.
   - PRN boluses.
   - free water flushes with tube feeds.
   - dose vanc renally 1g Q48H
   .
   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**] end [**11-4**]), completed cefepime
   per bronch recs.  No indications for atypical coverage at this time.
   - f/u daily vanc level, reduced to 1g q 48h.
   - PICC today
   .
   # Hypotension: Could be [**1-5**] hypovolemia +/- distributive shock.  CVP
   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient was
   repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.
   - now off pressors, tolerating BB

 no source found
   - xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   - needs o/p work-up

   # hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.  No continued
   bloody secretions from ET tube.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - suction / oral care as needed
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - hold diuresis
   - continue home dose BB
   - keep roughly even if possible
   - PO Lasix (near home dose)
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation

   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/CTX/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - resolving now off CTX/clindamycin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history with multiple ongoing medical complications. Here is a summary of the potential medical complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia and is on oxygen at home for presumed pulmonary hypertension. Initial acute hypercarbic respiratory failure was due to MRSA pneumonia, which has improved with ventilation.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, but it is unclear what the baseline creatinine level is. The patient's acute kidney injury has resolved with fluid administration. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the ARF.

3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin for three weeks. The patient has completed a course of cefepime.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. The central venous pressure (CVP) measurement is unreliable due to tracheostomy. The patient has been repleted with fluids, which has led to a substantial decrease in pressor requirements and resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.

5. Anticoagulation/DVT in Upper Extremity: The patient has bioprosthetic valves and exhibits signs of possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left upper extremity. A lower extremity Doppler was negative"

   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries for valve replacements, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. He presents with chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia (MRSA PNA). Other complications include acute kidney injury (ARF), hypotension, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity (DVT UE), anemia, hemoptysis, and right ventricular (RV) failure. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including vancomycin, cefepime, albuterol, ipratropium, fluconazole, warfarin, and beta blockers. He is also on a ventilator with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with frequent assessments of vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease, including repairs and replacements of valves, chronic atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and depression/anxiety. He is currently in the ICU for management of heart failure, acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, and MRSA pneumonia. The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, acute kidney injury, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity, hemoptysis, pulmonary hypertension, rhythm disturbances, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with an elevated PCO2 in the 60s and baseline bicarb in the 40s. This condition can lead to respiratory acidosis and may require further ventilation support.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential acute kidney injury. This condition can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT in the upper extremity, which increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolism to the lungs.
4. Hemoptysis: The patient has a history of grossly bloody material from the endotracheal tube, which may indicate bleeding in the respiratory tract. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of bleeding.
5. Pulmonary Hypertension"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a complex medical history including congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries to repair valves. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, and other comorbidities.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbia and is on home oxygen due to presumed pulmonary hypertension. He was previously treated for MRSA pneumonia and is currently on vancomycin.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, but it is unclear what the baseline level is. No acute elevation in BUN was noted, and the ARF resolved with fluids. Renal dosing of vancomycin has been adjusted.
3. MRSA pneumonia: The patient has MRSA in his sputum, and he is being treated with vancomycin for three weeks. Atypical coverage is not indicated at this time.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. Central venous pressure (CVP) was measured at 16 but may not accurately reflect volume status or preload. The patient has responded well to fluid repletion.
5. Anticoagulation/DVT in the left upper extremity (LUE): The patient has bioprosthetic valves, and there is evidence"

   Assessment and Plan
   58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and repairs in
   [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and
   mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and
   surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on
   coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for
   continued management of heart failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Resp failure: Patient has baseline hypercarbia with PCO2
   in 60s and baseline bicarb in 40s. On O2 at home for presumed pulmonary
   hypertension.  Etiology for initial acute hypercarbic resp failure MRSA
   PNA.  Hypoxia has improved with ventilation.  Sputum cx and BAL here
   (+) for MRSA PNA.  Status post trach.
   - on vanc last day [**11-4**], on albuterol and ipratropium.  Completed 8 day
   course of cefepime.
   - daily rsbi and PSV, wean trials, on trach, f/u ABG
   - continued on fluconazole D7/7 (thrush)
   .
   # ARF: Cr elevated this AM 1.5.  Unclear what baseline Cr is; trough Cr
   during this hospitalization is 1.0.  No acute elevation in BUN.  Likely
   pre-renal as has resolved with fluids.
   - PRN boluses.
   - free water flushes with tube feeds.
   - dose vanc renally 1g Q48H
   .
   # MRSA PNA
 found to have MRSA in sputum
   - vancomycin for 3 weeks (started [**10-14**] end [**11-4**]), completed cefepime
   per bronch recs.  No indications for atypical coverage at this time.
   - f/u daily vanc level, reduced to 1g q 48h.
   - PICC today
   .
   # Hypotension: Could be [**1-5**] hypovolemia +/- distributive shock.  CVP
   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient was
   repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.
   - now off pressors, tolerating BB
   - trend hct
   .
   # anticoagulation/DVT in UE: patient has bioprosthetic valves and
   nursing noted LUE  swollen, 3+ edema > RUE. Not warm to touch. PICC
   flushing and drawing back wnls.
   - UE Doppler (-) [**10-25**]
   - warfarin restarted
   .
   # acute Hct drop
 downtrending since admission.  No clear source of
   bleeding as hemoptysis has resolved.  Patient has a history of anemia,
   unclear baseline hct.
   - transfuse PRN
   - hemolysis labs, B12, folate wnl
 no source found
   - xfuse hct<21 or active ischemia
   - needs o/p work-up
   .
   # hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.  No continued
   bloody secretions from ET tube.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - suction / oral care as needed
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.
   - hold diuresis
   - continue home dose BB
   - keep roughly even if possible
   - PO Lasix (near home dose)
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of Chronic Afib present on admission, anticoagulated
   on admission, held for hemoptysis and rate controlled.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor coags
   - resume anticoagulation
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute with diffuse erythematous rash c/w drug
   eruption. Patient received Vanc/CTX/Clindamycin at OSH for unclear
   reasons but were stopped which are most likely culprits for drug rate.
   - resolving now off CTX/clindamycin
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved at OSH, not on heparin so HIT unlikely. No
   oozing from PIV.
   - significantly improved since admission; ?drug rxn from abx
   .
   # Diabetes: Apparently diet controlled.
   - follow QID FS with HISS

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgical repairs, including replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. He has chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is currently in the ICU for continued management of heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has baseline hypercarbia with increased PCO2 levels in the 60s and decreased bicarb levels in the 40s. He is on home oxygen for presumed pulmonary hypertension. Initially, the etiology for acute hypercarbic respiratory failure was MRSA pneumonia. His hypoxia has improved with ventilation, and sputum cultures and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) have confirmed MRSA pneumonia. The patient is currently on vancomycin and has completed an 8-day course of cefepime.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.5, but the baseline creatinine is unclear. Trough creatinine during hospitalization is 1.0. There is no acute elevation in BUN, and the kidney injury is likely pre-renal as it has resolved with fluid administration. The patient will receive"

   # Hypotension: Could be [**1-5**] hypovolemia +/- distributive shock.  CVP
   measured at 16 but given TR may not accurately reflect volume
   status/preload.  No lactate to indicated hypoperfusion.  Patient was
   repleted 5L since admission with substantial decrease in pressor
   requirement, as well as resolution of pre-renal insufficiency.

   # hemoptysis: Patient noted to have grossly bloody material from ET
   tube upon admission which had been going on at OSH. Unclear if
   traumatic intubation with coumadin on board. NG lavage negative upon
   arrival. Prelim CXR unchanged. The differential includes
   PNA/bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulm AVM, or cancer.  No continued
   bloody secretions from ET tube.
   - bronch showed only intubation trauma
   - suction / oral care as needed
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline
   RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA
   consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart
   disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension.
   His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral
   regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due
   to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive
   troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to
   [**Hospital1 54**] but difficult to interpret with but estimated EF 30-40%. An
   infective endocarditis could also account for valvular deterioration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of congenital heart disease and multiple surgeries, including replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves, closure of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO), and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure. The patient has a baseline hypercarbic respiratory failure with elevated PCO2 and bicarb levels. He is on home oxygen for presumed pulmonary hypertension. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and has completed an 8-day course of cefepime. He is currently on vancomycin for 3 weeks. 

The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine levels, but it has resolved with fluid repletion. He has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin. The patient has experienced hypotension, which could be due to hypovolemia or distributive shock. His central venous pressure (CVP) was measured at 16, but given the presence of a tracheostomy, it may not accurately reflect his volume status or preload. The patient was repleted with 5 liters of fluids since admission, which has led to a substantial decrease in pressor requirements and resolution of pre-renal insufficiency. 

The patient has a swollen left upper extremity (LUE) with 3+"
