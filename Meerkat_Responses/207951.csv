","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, and poor nutritional status. She was transferred to the MICU with altered mental status and tachycardia, and has been experiencing episodes of bradycardia. The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention:

1. Delirium: The patient is most likely experiencing multifactorial delirium caused by long hospitalization, medications (including opiates and sedating medications), poor nutritional status, and underlying infection. The plan is to hold all sedating medications, perform a head CT to evaluate for intracranial process, administer haldol 0.25mg PO as needed for agitation, provide frequent reorientation, and treat the underlying infection.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia throughout hospitalization, which is related to medication withdrawal, pain, and underlying infection. Monitoring of the heart rate will continue.

3. Bradycardia: The patient experienced two brief episodes of sinus bradycardia, with no evidence of arrhythmia or pauses. It is possible that the bradycardia was caused by a vagal stimulus with gastric distention. The plan is to monitor the patient on telemetry, continue gastric decompression, and perform a head CT to evaluate for intracranial process.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, and poor nutritional status. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The patient has several medical complications, including severe C. diff colitis, massive gastric distention, anasarca, urinary retention, and a previous right external iliac deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has evidence of volume overload on CXR, as well as left main bronchus mucus plugging. There is a question of a loculated effusion in the left lung. The plan includes continuing lasix IV to achieve negative fluid balance, aggressive pulmonary toilet, and considering bronchoscopy if there is no improvement with the above measures.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium is most likely multifactorial, caused by long hospitalization, medications (previously on opiates/sedating meds), poor nutritional status, and underlying infection. The plan includes holding all sedating medications, obtaining a head CT for evaluation, and using haldol as needed for agitation.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia throughout hospitalization, related to medication withdrawal, pain, and underlying infection. Monitoring is ongoing.
4. Bradycardia: The patient experienced two brief episodes of sinus bradyc"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, and poor nutritional status on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with altered mental status and tachycardia. The patient has multiple medical complications, including delirium, tachycardia, bradycardia, severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, anasarca, urinary retention, right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6째C (97.8째F), a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 153/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and receiving fluids through a midline IV line. The patient has a Foley catheter in place for urinary retention.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Delirium: Multifactorial cause, including long hospitalization, medications, poor nutritional status, and underlying infection. Plan includes holding sedating medications, performing a head CT, administering haloperidol, frequent reorientation, and treating underlying infection.
2. Tachycardia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic pain and dementia. She presented with delirium, ileus, C. diff colitis, and hypoxemia. The patient's mental status is improving with the use of haloperidol and synthroid. She has pneumonia due to aspiration and severe colitis without toxic megacolon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory compromise: The patient has compromised airways with mucus impaction and significant pleural effusions, which can lead to further respiratory distress.
2. C. diff infection: The patient has C. diff colitis, which can worsen and cause complications such as severe diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by aspiration, which may require interventions like bronchoscopy for treatment.
4. Delirium: The patient initially presented with delirium, which is improving but still requires monitoring and management.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an acute DVT in her right arm, which needs to be managed with anticoagulation therapy.
6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has chronic colonization of VRE in her Foley catheter, and there is a concern for UTI, especially if she develops a fever.
7. Sinus arrhythmia: The patient has sinus arrhythmia, which should be treated symptomatically.
8. Fluid balance: The patient has had significant fluid shifts, and careful monitoring of her fluid balance is necessary."

- There is a need for pigtail catheters for large pleural effusions versus slow diuresis.
- C. difficile colitis treatment involves continuing antibiotics, changing PO vancomycin to IV, keeping the patient NPO, and starting TPN. Reglan is also started.
- Sinus arrhythmia is being treated symptomatically due to tachy-brady syndrome.
- The patient has a history of chronic colonization with VRE and Foley catheter changes.
- The patient has an acute DVT in her right arm and is on Coumadin.
- Fluid balance is being managed with slow diuresis and albumin administration.
- The patient is on TPN, and PPN will be started once the picc line is replaced.
- Other interventions include stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, elevation of head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic pain and dementia.
- She presents with delirium, ileus, and C. difficile infection.
- She is currently on multiple medications including narcotics and psych medications.
- The patient has altered mental status due to hospitalization, narcotics, and psych medications.
- She has pneumonia, bradycardia, and sinus arrhythmia.
- The patient is experiencing urine retention with VRE colonization.
- She has a chronic colonization of VRE.
- She also has a right arm acute DVT and is on Coumadin.
- The patient is NPO for ileus and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- She is being treated for C. difficile colitis.
- She is also being treated for sinus arrhythmia.
- The patient has atelectasis and shallow breaths.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia - The patient has signs of pneumonia, which can be a serious infection in the lungs. It may require aggressive treatment with antibiotics and respiratory support.
2. Aspiration - Due to the patient's altered mental status and ileus, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. This can occur if food, liquids, or stomach contents are inhaled into the lungs.
3. Delirium - The patient's delirium could worsen if not properly managed. It is important to address the underlying causes and provide appropriate sedation if necessary"

1. Hypoxia: The patient has evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray, along with left main bronchus mucus plugging. There is also a question of left lobe loculated effusion. Measures to improve oxygenation and reduce effusion include continuing lasix 20mg IV, goal negative 1L daily, aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning, adding accapella, frequent nebs, and considering bronchoscopy if there is no improvement with the above measures.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium is most likely multifactorial, caused by long hospitalization, medications (previously on opiates/sedating meds), poor nutritional status, and underlying infection. Management includes holding all sedating medications, head CT for evaluation given the patient's use of coumadin, haldol 0.25mg PO as needed for agitation, frequent reorientation, and treating underlying infection.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia throughout her hospitalization, which is related to medication withdrawal, pain"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, and poor nutritional status on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with altered mental status and tachycardia. The patient has multiple medical issues including hypoxia, delirium, tachycardia, bradycardia, massive gastric distention, severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, anasarca (edema), urinary retention, right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and a positive VRE urine culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood. This could be due to a lung infection or mucus plugging, which can obstruct the airways and prevent proper ventilation.
2. Delirium: The patient is showing signs of confusion and altered mental status. This could be caused by medication side effects, infections, poor nutritional status, or a combination of these factors.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, which may be related to medication withdrawal, pain, or an underlying infection.
4. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced brief episodes of slow heart rate, which could be related to sinus node dysfunction.
5. Massive Gastric Distention: The patient has significant swelling of the stomach,"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, and poor nutritional status on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with altered mental status and tachycardia, along with episodes of bradycardia.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray, with mucus plugging in the left main bronchus and a question of left lobe loculated effusion. There is no new focal consolidation seen, and the nasogastric (NG) tube tip is not visualized extending beyond the confines of the image. There is no pneumothorax observed. The patient's aeration in the left lung has markedly improved, but there is a significant left pleural effusion present.

2. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely multifactorial, caused by long hospitalization, medications (previously on opiates/sedating medications), poor nutritional status, and underlying infection. The plan includes holding all sedating medications, performing a head CT for evaluation given the patient's use of coumadin, and initiating haloperidol for agitation.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia throughout her hospitalization, which is related to medication withdrawal, pain, and underlying infection. Close"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, and poor nutritional status. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, tachycardia, and episodes of bradycardia. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxia, severe C. diff colitis, anasarca, urinary retention, and a DVT. She is currently receiving aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning, haloperidol for delirium, and various medications for her other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to volume overload and left main bronchus mucus plugging, leading to loculated effusion. Continued pulmonary toileting and suctioning are recommended.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely multifactorial, caused by long-hospitalization, medications (previously on opiates/sedating meds), poor nutritional status, and underlying infection. Measures include holding all sedating medications, frequent reorientation, and treating underlying infection.
3. Tachycardia: The persistent sinus tachycardia may be related to medication withdrawal, pain, and underlying infection. Monitoring the patient's heart rate is advised.

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic pain and dementia. She presents with delirium, ileus, C. difficile infection, hypoxemia, and severe colitis. The patient's delirium is improving with the use of Haldol and starting Synthroid. 

The respiratory condition includes pneumonia, aspiration, and compromised airways with mucus impaction and significant pleural effusions. The patient requires intubation for bronchoscopy due to high O2 requirement and high burden of secretions. Chest PT and suctioning are recommended. 

C. difficile colitis treatment includes continuing antibiotics, changing PO vancomycin to PR with NG output, keeping the patient NPO, and starting TPN. 

Sinus arrhythmia, also known as tachy-brady syndrome, is being treated symptomatically. The patient's TSH level is 25, and Synthroid has been started. 

There is urine retention with VRE colonization, and a foley catheter change is required. The patient has an acute DVT in her right arm and is on Coumadin. Slow diuresis and albumin 2 are also recommended. 

The patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is expected to recover in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic pain and dementia. She presents with multifactorial delirium, ileus, Clostridium difficile infection (CDiff colitis), hypoxemia from pleural effusions/anasarca, and mucus plugging. The patient's delirium has improved with the use of Haldol and Synthroid. There has been a significant improvement in mucus plugging with chest physiotherapy. The patient also has volume overload, which is being managed with daily diuresis. Cdiff colitis and ileus are showing significant improvement, and the patient is receiving NG tube medications and advancing very slowly. The patient's sinus arrhythmia, known as tachy-brady syndrome, is being treated symptomatically, and her TSH level is 25, with initiation of Synthroid. The patient also has an acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her right arm and is on Coumadin. The patient was discharged to the floor before the physician had a chance to examine her.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as altered mental status, respiratory distress, and reduced oxygen saturation, may indicate the development of pneumonia.
2. Aspiration: Given the patient's altered mental status and risk factors, there is a possibility of aspiration leading to aspiration pneumonia.
3. Clostridium difficile infection (CDiff"
