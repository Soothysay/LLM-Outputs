","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but they have been intubated for impending respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, Demerol (meperidine Hcl), and unspecified medications. They have received various antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam (Versed), as well as other ICU medications such as morphine sulfate and lasix.

24-hour events include an abdominal ultrasound that showed no significant ascites, arterial line placement, administration of fluids and albumin for suspected septic shock, and intubation for respiratory failure. The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 33, improved sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels with fluids, and elevated lactic acid levels.

Physical examination reveals diaphoresis, an endotracheal tube in place, dry mucous membranes, trace edema in both extremities, and a flushed face. Vital signs include a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/52-105/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and a temperature of"

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with hepatic encephalopathy and sepsis.
   Sepsis: Given tachycardia, tachypnea and elevated white count, patient
   fits criteria for sepsis.  Likely source of infection is either a
   pneumonia as a consolidation was seen on her CXR, or SBP given her
   underlying liver disease.
   - Vancomycin, Zosyn, Azithromycin for empiric CAP coverage
   - Zosyn for empiric SBP coverage
   - Albumin for empiric SBP treatment
   - Will try for either abdominal guided paracentesis or thoracentesis.
   Will need FFP prior to procedure.
   - fluids not running this am as she
s fluid overloaded.
   - Lactate trending down
   - Patient will need central line today
   Respiratory failure:  Most likely cause was volume overload due to
   saline repletion and albumin.  Also it appears that she may have
   hepatorenal syndrome.  Her gas prior to intubation revealed a
   decreasing pH and increasing CO2.  She underwent nonemergent
   intubation.
   - Currently on AC  - wean FiO2 as tolerated.  Likely will need
   increased PEEP possible volume overload.
   - Lasix has been tried to remove fluid, although she has only voided 30
   cc to 40 IV.  Home dose is 60 mg dq.
   Liver Failure: stable at this point without objective evidence of
   decompensation
   - s/p albumin on [**2112-11-23**]
   - Urine Na < 10, suggesting hepatorenal syndrome.  Will get in touch
   with Liver regarding these levels and possible treatment with Midodrine
   and Octreotide.
   - Hold Lasix/Aldactone at this time
   - NGT placed for lactulose administration
   - Hepatology is following
   Coagulopathy: Patient now with increasing coagulation parameters
   - Will check hemolysis labs
   -  Will check smear to assess for schistocytes
   -  FFP prior to procedures
   ARF: Improving with Cr 1.6.
   - Will replete aggressively with saline and trend electrolytes
   - Urine lytes to in the am to assess for hepatorenal syndrome
   Metabolic Acidosis: Improving with saline.
   HTN: treated as an outpatient with Lasix/Aldactone
   - Holding these medications at this time given sepsis
   Migraines: patient on a triptan as an outpatient.  Will hold at this
   time.
   Depression: hold paxil at this time.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy and sepsis. The patient's current condition indicates multiple potential medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient fits the criteria for sepsis due to tachycardia, tachypnea, and elevated white blood cell count. The likely source of infection is either pneumonia or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) given her underlying liver disease. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient most likely experienced respiratory failure due to volume overload caused by saline repletion and albumin administration. There are also indications of hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy.

3. Liver failure: The patient has stable liver function at this point without objective evidence of decompensation. However, there are concerns about hepatorenal syndrome, and treatment with Midodrine and Octreotide may be considered.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient is experiencing increasing coagulation parameters, which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or another bleeding disorder. Further evaluation is needed, including hemolysis labs, smear assessment for schistocytes, and the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to procedures.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is improving,"

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with hepatic encephalopathy and sepsis.
   Sepsis: Given tachycardia, tachypnea and elevated white count, patient
   fits criteria for sepsis.  Likely source of infection is either a
   pneumonia as a consolidation was seen on her CXR, or SBP given her
   underlying liver disease.
   - Vancomycin, Zosyn, Azithromycin for empiric CAP coverage
   - Zosyn for empiric SBP coverage
   - Albumin for empiric SBP treatment
   - Will try for either abdominal guided paracentesis or thoracentesis.
   Will need FFP prior to procedure.
   - fluids not running this am as she
s fluid overloaded.
   - Lactate trending down
   - Patient will need central line today
   - Send endotracheal sputum culture
   Respiratory failure:  Most likely cause was volume overload due to
   saline repletion and albumin.  Other considerations are noncardiogenic
   respiratory failure. Her gas prior to intubation revealed a decreasing
   pH and increasing CO2.  She underwent nonemergent intubation.
   - Currently on AC  - wean FiO2 as tolerated.  Likely will need
   increased PEEP possible volume overload.
   - Lasix has been tried to remove fluid, although she has only voided 30
   cc to 40 IV.  Home dose is 60 mg qd
   - Increase rate to improve acidosis
   Liver Failure: stable at this point without objective evidence of
   decompensation
   - s/p albumin on [**2112-11-23**]
   - Urine Na < 10, suggesting hepatorenal syndrome, although unclear if
   patient is euvolemic at this time. Will get in touch with both Liver
   and Kidney
   - Hold Lasix/Aldactone at this time
   - NGT placed for lactulose administration
   Coagulopathy: Patient now with increasing coagulation parameters
   - Will check hemolysis labs
   -  Will check smear to assess for schistocytes
   -  FFP prior to procedures
   ARF: Improving with Cr 1.6.
   - Will replete aggressively with saline and trend electrolytes
   - Daily Urine lytes to in the am to assess for hepatorenal syndrome
   Metabolic Acidosis: Improving with saline.
   HTN: treated as an outpatient with Lasix/Aldactone
   - Holding these medications at this time given sepsis
   Migraines: patient on a triptan as an outpatient.  Will hold at this
   time.
   Depression: hold paxil at this time.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 49-year-old female with hepatic encephalopathy and sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and sedated. 

The patient has a history of liver failure and is being treated with albumin for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). 

She is receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and SBP. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/52-105/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,975 mL and total output of 490 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,485 mL. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals a pH of 7.22, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 39 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 117 mEq/L, oxygen saturation (PaO2) of 117 on 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and base excess (BE) of -11. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 33.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 37.4%, platelet (Plt) count of 81 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 60 mg/dL, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST) at 15/51 IU/L. 

The patient's coagulation parameters are increasing, and there is evidence of metabolic acidosis, which is improving with saline. 

The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis, and potential complications such as pneumonia, SBP, respiratory failure, liver failure, hepatorenal syndrome, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury (ARF), and metabolic acidosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to volume overload or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, worsening liver failure with decompensation, progression of hepatorenal syndrome, development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), further deterioration of kidney function, and persistent or worsening metabolic acidosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with hepatic encephalopathy and sepsis.
   #Sepsis: Given tachycardia, tachypnea and elevated white count, patient
   fits criteria for sepsis.  Likely source of infection is either a
   pneumonia as a consolidation was seen on her CXR, or SBP given her
   underlying liver disease.
   - Vancomycin, Zosyn, Azithromycin for empiric CAP coverage
   - Zosyn for empiric SBP coverage
   - Albumin for empiric SBP treatment
   -Thoracentesis [**11-25**] removed 850cc serosanguinous fluid. f/u cultures,
   labs.
   -Coags TID, checking for DIC, replete fibrinogen over 100. check smear
   for schistocytes.
   #Respiratory failure:  bilateral patchy infiltrates present on CXR.
   Possibly from volume overload but increased oxygen requirement with
   PaO2/FiO2<200 likely from ARDS. Oxygenation continues to be difficult.
   Ideal body weight of 54Kg used for ARDS net protocol, range 300-450cc
   tV.  Vent wave forms also suggestive of patient struggling against
   vent.  Will increase sedation.
   #ARF:Cr 2.6.  Likely from hepatorenal syndrome, as patient is
   adequately volume resuscitated. [**Month (only) 11**] also be from  ATN.
   -check U lytes
   -midodrine 10mg TID
   -octreotide 100mcg TID
   -albumin 50g IV daily
   -Renal recs
   #Liver Failure: EtOH and hep c cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Elevated bilirubin and INR. Thrombocytopenic.
   -holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   -liver service folowing
   - NGT placed for lactulose administration
   -administered vitamin K 1mg IV [**2112-11-25**]
   #Migraines: patient on a triptan as an outpatient.  Will hold at this
   time.
   #Depression: hold paxil at this time.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old female with hepatic encephalopathy and sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), liver failure, and potential complications from her underlying conditions such as pneumonia or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and is on ARDS net protocol, indicating possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest ARF, which may be due to hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Infection: The patient is suspected to have pneumonia or SBP. Infections can worsen sepsis and lead to further complications.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be exacerbated by infections or other stressors.
5. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged INR indicates a bleeding risk. Close monitoring and appropriate coagulation management are necessary.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, liver enzymes, and infection parameters. Timely intervention and appropriate management of these potential complications are crucial for"

   #Sepsis: Likely underlying pneumonia progressing to ARDS, hepatorenal
   syndrome, and multiorgan failure
   - Vancomycin, Zosyn, Azithromycin for empiric CAP coverage
   - Zosyn for empiric SBP coverage
   - Albumin for empiric SBP treatment
   -Thoracentesis [**11-25**] removed 850cc serosanguinous fluid. f/u cultures,
   labs. Gram stain negative; f/u culture
   -Coags TID, checking for DIC, replete fibrinogen over ~100. check smear
   for schistocytes (reviewed o/n, negative)
   #Respiratory failure:  ARDS net ventilation, but increasing respiratory
   rate to 35.
   Paralyzed yesterday because of vent [**Last Name (LF) 1493**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] release paralysis
   now to re-evaluate.
   #Liver Failure: EtOH and hep c cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Elevated bilirubin and INR. Thrombocytopenic but
   platelets are not dropping. Liver service is following and saw last
   night and this morning. As per hepatology service, infection/sepsis may
   preclude transplant so plan is to continue with supportive care.
   -holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   -liver service following
   - NGT placed for lactulose administration
   Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.
   - D10 when FSG < 100
   - Follow lactates
   Coagulopathy: can replete fibrinogen. Smear reviewed overnight and no
   e/o DIC or schistocytes seen, and therefore this is probably a
   synthetic problem with the liver.
   -administered vitamin K 1mg IV [**2112-11-25**]
   - FFP if active bleeding or planned line
   - cryo for further fibrinogen decrease.
   #ARF: Cr 4.1.  Likely from hepatorenal syndrome, as patient is
   adequately volume resuscitated. [**Month (only) 11**] also be from  ATN.
   -check U lytes which have low but not negligible sodium
   -midodrine 10mg TID, octreotide 100mcg TID, albumin 50g IV daily
   - f/u renal recs: discussed with renal team and will plan family
   meeting re: CVVH. Renal recommended adding bicarbonate, so changed
   bicarb infusion with D5.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of ARDS, sepsis, liver/renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient has developed ARDS, likely secondary to underlying pneumonia. The respiratory rate is being increased to 35 breaths per minute to improve oxygenation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis due to the progression of pneumonia to ARDS. Empiric antibiotics have been started for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) coverage.
3. Liver Failure: The patient has a history of alcohol use disorder (EtOH) and hepatitis C cirrhosis. Liver function tests show elevated bilirubin and INR. Hepatocellular dysfunction is suspected.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL. Hepatorenal syndrome is a possible cause of renal failure in this case.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of hypoglycemia, possibly due to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan dysfunction. Frequent monitoring and administration of dextrose infusion are being done to maintain blood sugar levels.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation problem, likely due to liver failure. Vitamin K administration and"

","The patient is a 49-year-old female with a chief complaint of ARDS, sepsis, and liver/renal failure. She has undergone several interventions, including thoracentesis, placement of an arterial line, central venous line, and urinary catheter. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including antibiotics for suspected CAP and SBP, albumin for SBP treatment, and coagulation factors to address coagulopathy.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/46 mmHg to 121/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her current weight is 73 kg, and her height is 61 inches.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.5 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 7.9 mmol/L, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 100 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L, hypoglycemia with a glucose level of 16 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes including AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The patient underwent a thoracentesis, which revealed transudative pleural fluid with elevated LDH but stable serum LDH levels. Blood cultures were also taken. The patient's synthetic function is poor, and they have had low blood glucose levels requiring IV dextrose administration. Lactate levels were rising, indicating possible sepsis and anaerobic metabolism, for which 2 amps of bicarb were given.

The patient was paralyzed overnight to improve synchrony with the ventilator, and started on levophed due to a drop in blood pressure overnight. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. Allergies include penicillins, unspecified, and Demerol (meperidine Hcl), causing nausea/vomiting.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, azithromycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Infusions include midazolam, fentanyl, cisatracurium, and norepinephrine. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), sodium bicarbonate, and dextrose.

Vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates central venous pressure within normal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient underwent thoracentesis and blood cultures were taken. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and other medications for their condition.

The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate (104 bpm), slightly elevated blood pressure (116/46 mmHg), and decreased respiratory rate (35 insp/min). The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on mechanical ventilation. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 24 mmHg, indicating possible fluid overload. The total fluid input is 3,010 mL, while the total fluid output is 1,121 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 1,889 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 35 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 65%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a low pH of 7.19, high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 85 mmHg, and a respiratory system compliance of 33.3 cmH2O/mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of HCV and EtOH cirrhosis, listed for liver transplant. He presented to the emergency department after falling and was subsequently intubated due to tachypnea and worsening respiratory acidosis. He was started on octreotide and midodrine for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). 

The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), coagulopathy, and liver failure. He requires aggressive management in the ICU with attention to glycemic control, nutrition, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, potentially due to pneumonia or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). His respiratory failure may contribute to fluid overload and worsening metabolic acidosis.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient continues to require high levels of FiO2 and is being ventilated according to ARDSnet protocol. The cause of this failure could be related to hepatopulmonary syndrome.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine is rising, and urine output is decreasing, suggesting ARF. This may be due to HRS.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated IN"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of hepatitis C and etoh cirrhosis, who is listed for liver transplant. She presented to the emergency department after a fall and was subsequently intubated due to tachypnea and worsening respiratory acidosis. She has been started on octreotide and midodrine for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient's current condition includes sepsis with an unknown source, hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, and liver failure. She is currently on multiple medications and has several lines and tubes in place. The patient's goals of care will be discussed with the liver service, and a family meeting will be scheduled.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing sepsis with an unknown source, and there is concern for infection in the abdomen (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) or pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started, and further investigations are planned to identify the source of infection.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has improved with the use of paralytics, and she is being ventilated according to the ARDS net protocol. The healthcare team is considering removing dead space tubing and optimizing gas exchange.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's urine output is decreasing, and there is a concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Renal consultation is pending, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   49W HCV, EtOH cirrhosis
 listed for liver transplant presented to OSH
   ED after fall, no fx on imaging, inc WBC, tachypneic, tachycardic,
   transferred [**Hospital1 1**].  Subsequently intubated for tachypnea, worsening
   resp acidosis.  Started on octreotide and midodrine for HRS.
   1) Sepsis
   Source of sepsis pna vs. abdominal (SBP).
   Continue antibiotics vanc, zosyn, azithro and flagy.  Day #4 vanc,
   zosyn and azithro day 3 flagyl.  Total 10 day course.
   Will check urine legionella if negative will stop azithromycin.
   Progressive resp failure adds evidence for PNA but also could be factor
   of fluid overload and evolving met acicdosis.
   Small amount of ascites not amenable to tapping.
   Considering CT to further assess for sites infection.
   Continue levophed
   2) Hypoxemic resp failure-improved with paralytics, x-ray improved
   Vent per ARDS net protocol
   Will hold on paralytics
   Check gas and remove dead space tubing
   ? component of shunt (? Hepatopulm)
   3) ARF
   Creat rising and urine output falling off
 currently ~10cc/hr
   despite fluid resuscitation.
   Concerning for HRS.
   Octreotide & midodrine.
   Consulted renal regarding CVVH.
   Bicarb drip per renal will hold if oxygenation drops secondary to
   volume
   4)Coagulopathy
   INR up, plt stable
   synthetic fxn due to liver disease plus potential consumptive from
   sepsis
   IV vit K, will need FFP prior to procedures.
   5) Liver failure-hypoglycemia concerning for end stage liver disease.
   Continue glucose drip.
   6) Goals of care-Will discuss with liver service if she is still a
   candidate for transplant.  Will discuss goals of care with family and
   family meeting.  Per liver service patient is not currently a
   transplant candidate given active infection.  Renal service concerned
   that CVVH with not change the underlying prognosis if patient is not a
   transplant candidate.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV and EtOH cirrhosis who is listed for liver transplant. She presented to the emergency department after a fall and was transferred to another hospital due to tachypnea and worsening respiratory acidosis. She was subsequently intubated and started on octreotide and midodrine for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her condition and treatment:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, possibly due to pneumonia versus abdominal (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). She is being treated with a combination of antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, azithromycin, and metronidazole. The antibiotics will be continued for a total of 10 days.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has improved with the use of paralytics, and her chest X-ray shows improved lung infiltrates. She is being ventilated according to the ARDSNet protocol. The plan is to hold on paralytics and check for gas exchange and dead space tubing. The cause of her respiratory failure may be related to fluid overload and evolving metabolic acidosis.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and her urine output is decreasing. This could be concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Octreotide and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with multiple medical complications. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

The patient's chief complaints include fever and dialysis catheter placement. Her renal status is concerning, with acidosis that required IV bicarb infusion. The patient also has thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 58), anemia (Hct of 20), and elevated lactate levels. Her blood gases show hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 75) and hypercapnia (ABG pH of 7.25). 

The patient has received a total of 3 packed red blood cells, 14 fresh frozen plasma units, 1 cryoprecipitate unit, and 2 platelet transfusions. She is receiving multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), and cisatracurium.

Her vital signs show tachycardia (HR of 89 bpm) and hypotension (BP of 97/39 mmHg). She is febrile with a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit. Her oxygen saturation is at 94% on 100% FiO2. Her CVP is elevated at 27 mmHg.

The patient's blood work indicates elevated white blood cell count (18."

   Assessment and Plan :  49F with ARDS, sepsis, and Liver/Renal failure.
   #Sepsis: Likely underlying pneumonia progressing to ARDS, hepatorenal
   syndrome, and multiorgan failure
   - Vancomycin, Zosyn, Azithromycin for empiric CAP coverage
   - Zosyn for empiric SBP coverage
   - Albumin for empiric SBP treatment
   -Thoracentesis [**11-25**] removed 850cc serosanguinous fluid. f/u cultures,
   labs. Gram stain negative; f/u culture
   -Coags TID, checking for DIC, replete fibrinogen over ~100. check smear
   for schistocytes (reviewed o/n, negative)
   #Respiratory failure:  ARDS net ventilation, but increasing respiratory
   rate to 35.
   Paralyzed yesterday because of vent [**Last Name (LF) 1493**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] release paralysis
   now to re-evaluate.
   #Liver Failure: EtOH and hep c cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Elevated bilirubin and INR. Thrombocytopenic but
   platelets are not dropping. Liver service is following and saw last
   night and this morning. As per hepatology service, infection/sepsis may
   preclude transplant so plan is to continue with supportive care.
   -holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   -liver service following
   - NGT placed for lactulose administration
   Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.
   - D10 when FSG < 100
   - Follow lactates
   Coagulopathy: can replete fibrinogen. Smear reviewed overnight and no
   e/o DIC or schistocytes seen, and therefore this is probably a
   synthetic problem with the liver.
   -administered vitamin K 1mg IV [**2112-11-25**]
   - FFP if active bleeding or planned line
   - cryo for further fibrinogen decrease.
   #ARF: Cr 4.1.  Likely from hepatorenal syndrome, as patient is
   adequately volume resuscitated. [**Month (only) 11**] also be from  ATN.
   -check U lytes which have low but not negligible sodium
   -midodrine 10mg TID, octreotide 100mcg TID, albumin 50g IV daily
   - f/u renal recs: discussed with renal team and will plan family
   meeting re: CVVH. Renal recommended adding bicarbonate, so changed
   bicarb infusion with D5.
   #Migraines: Will hold at this time.
   #Depression: hold paxil at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of ARDS, sepsis, liver and renal failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 102.0°F (38.9°C), blood pressure ranging from 94/35 mmHg to 124/114 mmHg, heart rate between 89-101 bpm, respiratory rate at 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple organ failure, including respiratory, liver, and renal failure. She has received several blood products and has had ongoing fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's ARDS and ongoing mechanical ventilation increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of pneumonia progressing to ARDS and liver/renal failure, there is a high risk of ongoing sepsis and potential development of multi-drug resistant organisms.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: With the patient's history of hepatic cirrhosis and elevated bilirubin and INR levels, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, especially if the liver function continues to deteriorate.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's current renal failure may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not"

   Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.

   - Follow lactates
   Coagulopathy: Smear reviewed overnight and no e/o DIC or schistocytes
   seen, and therefore this is probably a synthetic problem with the
   liver.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old female with ARDS, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and is experiencing increasing respiratory rate and dyssynchrony. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and cirrhosis, and liver/renal function is declining. CVVH has been initiated for fluid removal, but there is a risk of further deterioration in liver and kidney function if not managed correctly.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient is trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar levels, likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan dysfunction. Frequent monitoring and administration of D10 gtt may be necessary to maintain blood glucose levels.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a synthetic problem with the liver, leading to coagulopathy. Vitamin K has been administered, and FFP or cryoprecipitate may be required for active bleeding or planned procedures.

5. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection due to sepsis and multiorgan failure. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any signs of infection.

6. Migraines and depression: The patient has a history of migraines and depression, but these are currently on hold due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), liver failure, and coagulopathy. He has a history of multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening respiratory failure, decreased urine output, and increasing lactate levels despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) requirement, and there is evidence of hepatopulmonary syndrome. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an increasing international normalized ratio (INR) and decreasing platelet count. He has also developed bleeding from mucosal surfaces and an arterial stick in the groin. The family has decided to change the patient's code status to do not resuscitate (DNR). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which has led to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) involving the liver, kidneys, and lungs.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure is consistent with ARDS, characterized by hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests indicate liver dysfunction, with elevated liver enzymes and low albumin levels.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters, including an elevated IN"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, and potential hepatopulmonary syndrome. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics and has undergone dialysis catheter placement. His vital signs are unstable, with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient requires high FiO2 to maintain oxygen saturation. He is on mechanical ventilation according to ARDSnet protocol. Laboratory results indicate worsening renal function, coagulopathy, and liver dysfunction. There is concern for hepatorenal syndrome and the need for octreotide and midodrine. An ultrasound-guided tap for pleural effusion is being considered due to limited positioning options. A CT scan may be ordered to assess for potential infection sites.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not managed appropriately.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels and decreasing urine output. This could progress to chronic kidney disease if not addressed promptly.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is impaired, increasing the risk of bleeding complications"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient has a fever of 102.0, indicating an infection or inflammatory response in the body. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury, as indicated by the elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl-), are also abnormal, suggesting electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's respiratory status is being supported by mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, and the ventilator settings indicate a controlled mode of ventilation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a respiratory acidosis with an elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) level.

The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating impaired blood clotting function. The white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated, which can be a sign of infection.

Furthermore, the patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are elevated, suggesting liver dysfunction. The patient's albumin level is decreased, indicating poor nutritional status or chronic disease.

The patient has multiple lines and catheters inserted, including an arterial line, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and dialysis catheter. These lines pose a risk for infection, such"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan :  49F with ARDS, sepsis, and Liver/Renal failure.
   #Sepsis: Likely underlying pneumonia progressing to ARDS, hepatorenal
   syndrome, and multiorgan failure
   - Vancomycin, Zosyn, Azithromycin for empiric CAP coverage
 will need
   to dose with CVVH
   - Albumin for empiric SBP treatment
   -Thoracentesis [**11-25**] removed 850cc serosanguinous fluid. f/u cultures,
   labs. Gram stain negative; f/u culture
   - Smear negative for shistocytes
    #Respiratory failure:  ARDS net ventilation, but increasing
   respiratory rate to 35.
   - Patient reparalyzed.
    #Hepatorenal Syndrome: EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Liver/Renal function continues to decline.  Patient
   started on CVVH on the morning of [**2112-11-27**]
   - Supportive care
   - holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   - Patient on Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for treatment
   - Patient on CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated
   Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.
   - D10 when FSG < 100
   - Follow lactates
    Coagulopathy: Smear reviewed overnight and no e/o DIC or schistocytes
   seen, and therefore this is probably a synthetic problem with the
   liver.
   -administered vitamin K 1mg IV [**2112-11-25**]
   - FFP if active bleeding or planned line
   - Cryo for fibrinogen < 100.

","The patient is a 49-year-old female with ARDS, sepsis, and liver/renal failure. The patient's medical history includes EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, history of hepatic encephalopathy. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 86/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 of 80%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history.

The patient has been started on CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated and is being treated with Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for hepatorenal syndrome. The patient also requires supportive care including D10 gtt to maintain blood sugar levels, administration of vitamin K 1mg IV, and cryo for fibrinogen < 100.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and unspecified medications. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin, azithromycin, metronidazole, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and decreased platelet count. Imaging reveals diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally consistent with known ARDS. Microbiology tests are pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with ARDS, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. She has a history of ethanol and hepatitis C cirrhosis, as well as hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She is also on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) for fluid removal.

Medical Complications:

1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient has diffuse airspace opacities on imaging, consistent with ARDS. She requires net ventilation and her respiratory rate has been increased to 35 breaths per minute.

2. Sepsis: The patient has suspected underlying pneumonia progressing to sepsis. Empiric coverage for CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) has been initiated with vancomycin and Zosyn.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and cirrhosis. Her liver and renal functions continue to decline, indicating hepatorenal syndrome. CVVH has been started for fluid removal and supportive care is being provided.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient is trending towards hypoglycemia, likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan dysfunction. Frequent fingersticks and dextrose supplementation are being implemented to maintain blood sugar levels.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient exhibits signs of coagulopathy, with"

   Assessment and Plan :  49F with ARDS, sepsis, and Liver/Renal failure.
   #Sepsis: Likely underlying pneumonia progressing to ARDS, hepatorenal
   syndrome, and multiorgan failure
   - Vancomycin, Zosyn, for empiric CAP coverage
 will need to dose with
   CVVH,
   - Azithromycin completed. Legionella urinary antigen unable to be sent
   - Currently off levophed now but will aim for MAPS<65. Poor a-line
   tracing may need to be replaced
   - Albumin for empiric SBP treatment
   - Smear negative for shistocytes
    #Respiratory failure:  ARDS net ventilation, but increasing
   respiratory rate to 35.
   -          Patient reparalyzed.  Continuing hyperventilation.
   -          Wean down F1O[2] as tolerated.
   # Liver Failure
   - Liver following; continuing supportive care for now. Subsequent liver
   problems as below
   ##Hepatorenal Syndrome: EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Liver/Renal function continues to decline.  Patient
   started on CVVH on the morning of [**2112-11-27**]
   - Supportive care
   - holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   - Patient on Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for treatment
   - Patient on CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated
   ## Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.
   - D10 when FSG < 100,
   - Follow lactates
   - Her hypoglycemia is likely due to ongoing liver dysfunction, but will
   add on random cortisol to see if her cortisol is either very low or
   very high (as expected)
   ## Coagulopathy: Smear reviewed overnight and no e/o DIC or
   schistocytes seen, and therefore this is probably a synthetic problem
   with the liver.
   -administered vitamin K 1mg IV [**2112-11-25**]
   - FFP if active bleeding or planned line
   - Cryo for fibrinogen < 100.
   #Migraines: Will hold at this time.
   #Depression: hold paxil at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with ARDS, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 weaned back to 60% and PEEP at 20. She remains paralyzed on the vent. The patient has a history of etoh and HepC cirrhosis, and is showing signs of hepatorenal syndrome. She is on CVVH for fluid removal and treatment of liver/renal failure. The patient's blood sugar levels are being maintained with D10 gtt, and her hypoglycemia is likely due to ongoing liver dysfunction. Coagulopathy is also present, likely secondary to liver dysfunction. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory, liver, renal, and metabolic derangements. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's current need for mechanical ventilation indicates respiratory failure, and there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other complications associated with prolonged intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially progress to septic shock.
3. ARDS: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is present, characterized by severe lung inflammation and impaired oxygenation. The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: This syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan :  49F with ARDS, sepsis, and Liver/Renal failure.
   #Sepsis: Likely underlying pneumonia progressing to ARDS, hepatorenal
   syndrome, and multiorgan failure
   - Vancomycin, Zosyn, for empiric CAP coverage
 will need to dose with
   CVVH,
   - Azithromycin completed. Legionella urinary antigen unable to be sent
   - Currently off levophed now but will aim for MAPS<65. Poor a-line
   tracing may need to be replaced
   - Albumin for empiric SBP treatment
   Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure, although DIC, hemolysis also
   a concern.  Coagulation parameters still elevated although improving.
   - Will send for another smear
   - Send haptoglobin
   - FFP if active bleeding or planned line
   - Cryo for fibrinogen < 100.
    #Respiratory failure:  ARDS net ventilation, but increasing
   respiratory rate to 35.
   -    Patient deparalyzed this morning and will resume as needed
   -    Wean down F1O[2] as tolerated.
   # Liver Failure:
   - Increased indirect bilirubin and may be due to poor conjugation
   rather than hemolysis.  Will workup with smear and hapto.
   - Liver following; continuing supportive care for now. Subsequent liver
   problems as below
   #Hepatorenal Syndrome: EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Liver/Renal function continues to decline.  Patient
   started on CVVH on the morning of [**2112-11-27**]
   - Supportive care
   - holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   - Patient on Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for treatment
   - Patient on CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated
   ## Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.
   - D10 when FSG < 100,
   - Follow lactates
   - Her hypoglycemia is likely due to ongoing liver dysfunction, but will
   add on random cortisol to see if her cortisol is either very low or
   very high (as expected)
   #Migraines: Will hold at this time.
   #Depression: hold paxil at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points.
   Sepsis
   Source of sepsis pna vs. abdominal (SBP) with increasing lactate,
   decreasing HCO3 despite broad spectrum Abx since admit.
   Current evidence points more to pna given progressive resp failure.
   However, could also represent fluid overload and increased resp demands
   due to evolving met acicdosis.
   Small amount of ascites not amenable to tapping
 may benefit from
   bedside u/s if retapping deamed to change mgmt

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points.
   Sepsis
   Source of sepsis pna vs. abdominal (SBP)
   Current evidence points more to pna given progressive resp failure.
   However, could also represent fluid overload and increased resp demands
   due to evolving met acicdosis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) involving the liver, kidneys, and lungs. The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can worsen and lead to further complications such as organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

2. Liver Failure: The patient has signs of liver failure, including coagulopathy, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin levels, and altered mental status. Complications related to liver failure may include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic hydrothorax.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric (not producing urine) and has a rising creatinine level, indicating renal failure. Complications related to renal failure may include fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic toxicity.

4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, with the need for mechanical ventilation and an increasing FiO2 requirement. ARDS can progress to respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a high INR and falling platelet count, indicating coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

6. Hypoglycemia: The"

   Assessment and Plan :  49F with ARDS, sepsis, and Liver/Renal failure.
   #Sepsis: Patient initially with presumed RLL pna that appeared to
   resolve radiographically and objectively while on broad spectrum abx.
   Now she is hypothermic with a new leuckocytosis and possible LLL
   infiltrate.  Concern for VAP.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Zosyn, for empiric CAP coverage
 will need to
   dose with CVVH,
   - Azithromycin completed. Legionella urinary antigen unable to be sent
   - Will DC Flagyl as patient has been Cdiff negative
   - Will attempt BAL in order to get sputum sample as she does not have
   copius secretions
   - Will start Levoquin in order to double cover Pseudomonas
   - Attempting to wean off Levophed, but requiring it during CVVH
   Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure, although DIC, hemolysis also
   a concern.  Coagulation parameters still elevated although improving.
   - Smear with occasional schistos, haptoglobin < 20, both thought to be
   due to underlying liver failure as opposed to DIC.  No clinical signs
   of DIC at this point.
   - Cryo for fibrinogen < 100.
   - Patient given 2 U FFP yesterday
    #Respiratory failure:  ARDS net ventilation, but increasing
   respiratory rate to 35.
   -    High PIPs and plateau pressures today.  Will attempt to wean TV as
   tolerated
   -    Patient deparalyzed this morning and will resume as needed
   -    Wean down F1O[2] as tolerated.
   # Liver Failure:
   - Continually increasing indirect bilirubin and may be due to poor
   conjugation rather than hemolysis.
   - Liver following; continuing supportive care for now. Subsequent liver
   problems as below.
   #Hepatorenal Syndrome: EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Liver/Renal function remains stable.  Patient continues
   on CVVH.
   - Supportive care
   - holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   - Patient on Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for treatment
   - Patient on CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated
   ## Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.
   - D10 when FSG < 100,
   - Follow lactates
   - Her hypoglycemia is likely due to ongoing liver dysfunction, but will
   add on random cortisol to see if her cortisol is either very low or
   very high (as expected)
   #Migraines: Will hold at this time.
   #Depression: hold paxil at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of ARDS, sepsis, liver/renal failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been unstable, with hypothermia, leukocytosis, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There are concerns about hepatorenal syndrome, hypoglycemia, and coagulopathy. The patient has received multiple blood products and continues to be on CVVH for fluid removal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent development of hypothermia and leukocytosis, along with a possible left lower lobe infiltrate on imaging, raises concern for VAP. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be continued, and efforts to wean off mechanical ventilation should be made while monitoring for any signs of worsening respiratory status.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: Given the patient's history of EtOH abuse, HepC cirrhosis, and hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome should be considered. Close monitoring of liver and renal function is essential, along with supportive care and treatment with Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia is likely secondary to ongoing liver dysfunction. Frequent fingerstick blood glucose monitoring and administration of D10 g"

The patient is a 49-year-old female with a chief complaint of arterial line stoppage. The patient has a history of ARDS, sepsis, liver/renal failure, and other comorbidities. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with high FiO2 and PEEP settings. The patient has received multiple blood products, including cryo, FFP, and platelets, due to coagulopathy concerns. She is also on CVVH for fluid removal. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, elevated liver enzymes, and signs of renal dysfunction. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and specific medications for suspected underlying infections. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory failure, liver failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with ongoing need for mechanical ventilation and high FiO2 delivery. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including elevated WBC count and positive cultures. There is a risk of progression to multiorgan failure.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. This can lead to further deterioration in liver function and potential complications such as hepatic encephalopathy.

   Assessment and Plan :  49F with ARDS, sepsis, and Liver/Renal failure.
   #Sepsis: Likely underlying pneumonia progressing to ARDS, hepatorenal
   syndrome, and multiorgan failure
   - Vancomycin, Zosyn, for empiric CAP coverage
 will need to dose with
   CVVH,
   - Azithromycin completed. Legionella urinary antigen unable to be sent
   - Currently off levophed now but will aim for MAPS<65. Poor a-line
   tracing may need to be replaced
   - Albumin for empiric SBP treatment
   Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure, although DIC, hemolysis also
   a concern.  Coagulation parameters still elevated although improving.
   - Will send for another smear
   - Send haptoglobin
   - FFP if active bleeding or planned line
   - Cryo for fibrinogen < 100.
    #Respiratory failure:  ARDS net ventilation, but increasing
   respiratory rate to 35.
   -                      Patient deparalyzed this morning and will resume
   as needed
   -                      Wean down F1O[2] as tolerated.
   # Liver Failure:
   - Increased indirect bilirubin and may be due to poor conjugation
   rather than hemolysis.  Will workup with smear and hapto.
   - Liver following; continuing supportive care for now. Subsequent liver
   problems as below
   #Hepatorenal Syndrome: EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Liver/Renal function continues to decline.  Patient
   started on CVVH on the morning of [**2112-11-27**]
   - Supportive care
   - holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   - Patient on Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for treatment
   - Patient on CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated
   ## Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.
   - D10 when FSG < 100,
   - Follow lactates
   - Her hypoglycemia is likely due to ongoing liver dysfunction, but will
   add on random cortisol to see if her cortisol is either very low or
   very high (as expected)
   #Migraines: Will hold at this time.
   #Depression: hold paxil at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of ARDS, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with liver and renal failure. The patient has a complex medical history including ethanol abuse, hepatitis C cirrhosis, and hepatic encephalopathy. She is experiencing hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any worsening of symptoms.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient has respiratory failure due to ARDS. It is crucial to maintain oxygenation and ventilation support, and consider weaning off sedation and mechanical ventilation as tolerated.
3. Liver Failure: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and indirect bilirubin levels, indicating liver dysfunction. Close monitoring of liver function and management of complications such as coagulopathy and encephalopathy are essential.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure associated with liver disease. Management includes supportive care, holding diuretics, and using CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is experiencing hypoglycemia, likely secondary to ongoing liver dysfunction and multiorgan dysfunction. Frequent"

   - Continue Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levoquin for empiric coverage.
   - Follow-ip cultures
   - Continue Levophed as needed
    Respiratory failure:  ARDS net ventilation

   -    Patient deparalyzed this morning and will resume as needed
   -    Wean down F1O2 as tolerated.
   Hepatorenal Syndrome: EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Liver/Renal function remains stable.  Patient continues
   on CVVH.
   - Supportive care
   - holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   - Patient on Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for treatment
   - Patient on CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated
   Coagulopathy/Liver failure: likely due to liver failure.  Coagulation
   parameters still elevated although improving.
   - Cryo for fibrinogen < 100.
   - Continually increasing indirect bilirubin and may be due to poor
   conjugation rather than hemolysis.
   - Liver following; continuing supportive care for now. Subsequent liver
   problems as below.
   Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of ARDS, sepsis, liver/renal failure, and increasing leukocytosis. She is currently hypothermic and has a possible left lower lobe infiltrate. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, coagulopathy/liver failure, hypoglycemia, migraines, and depression. She is being treated with various medications and interventions including broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, and nutritional support. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing multiorgan dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's presence of a possible left lower lobe infiltrate while on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has a history of hepatic cirrhosis and encephalopathy, which increases the risk of hepatorenal syndrome, a form of renal failure caused by advanced liver disease.
3. Coagulopathy/liver failure: The patient's elevated coagulation parameters suggest ongoing liver dysfunction, which can lead to bleeding complications.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's liver failure and multiorgan dysfunction may impair glucose production, leading to hypoglycemia.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and presence of potential lung infiltrates indicate a possible ongoing infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with ARDS, sepsis, and Liver/Renal failure
   Sepsis: Patient initially with presumed RLL pna that appeared to
   resolve radiographically and objectively while on broad spectrum abx.
   Workup thus far negative for organism.  Flagyl was empirically added on
   [**2112-12-1**] and her leuckocytosis is decreasing.  She remains afebrile
   over the past 24 hours.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levoquin for empiric coverage.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Wean Levophed as needed
    Respiratory failure:  ARDS net ventilation.  Esophageal balloon placed
   for transthoracic measuring.
   - Wean Fi02, PEEP as tolerated
   - Wean down F1O2 as tolerated.
   Hepatorenal Syndrome: EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Liver/Renal function remains stable.  Patient continues
   on CVVH.
   - Supportive care
   - Holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   - Patient on Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for treatment
   - Patient on CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated
   Coagulopathy/Liver failure: likely due to liver failure.  Coagulation
   parameters still elevated although improving.
   - Cryo for fibrinogen < 100.
   - Continually increasing indirect bilirubin and may be due to poor
   conjugation rather than hemolysis.
   - Liver following; continuing supportive care for now. Subsequent liver
   problems as below.
   Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.
   - D10 gtt
   - Follow lactates
   Migraines: Will hold at this time.
   Depression: hold paxil at this time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with ARDS, sepsis, and liver/renal failure. The patient initially presented with presumed right lower lobe pneumonia but appeared to resolve radiographically and objectively while on broad-spectrum antibiotics. A blood culture was taken and showed gram-negative bacteria, but the culture did not grow any organisms. The patient received fibrinogen twice and had an esophageal balloon placed to allow an increase in PEEP. The patient desaturated overnight and required increased FiO2, but ABG showed good oxygenation. Metronidazole was added empirically.

The patient's allergies include penicillins and unspecified medications. The last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin on 11/30/2011 at 06:01 AM, vancomycin on 11/30/2011 at 03:53 PM, levofloxacin on 12/01/2011 at 01:49 PM, and piperacillin/tazobactam on 12/02/2011 at 12:09 AM. Metronidazole was started on 12/02/2011 at 01:10 AM.

The patient is receiving midazolam, norepinephrine, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), and KCl (CRRT). Other ICU medications include unspecified medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except"

The patient is a 49-year-old female with ARDS, sepsis, and liver/renal failure. She was initially diagnosed with presumed right lower lobe pneumonia, which appeared to resolve while on broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, her leukocytosis is decreasing, and she remains afebrile over the past 24 hours. The patient is currently receiving Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levofloxacin for empiric coverage. Respiratory support includes CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation with a FiO2 of 90% and PEEP of 22 cmH2O. She is also receiving midazolam, norepinephrine, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), and potassium chloride (CRRT). The patient has a history of EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, resulting in hepatorenal syndrome. Her liver/renal function remains stable, and she is being supported with CVVH and medications such as midodrine, octreotide, and albumin. Coagulopathy/liver failure is also present, likely due to liver failure. The patient's hypoglycemia is trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar levels, possibly secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan dysfunction. Other medical conditions include migraines and depression. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

   Workup thus far negative for organism.  Flagyl was empirically added on
   [**2112-12-1**] and her leuckocytosis is decreasing.  She remains afebrile
   over the past 24 hours.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levoquin for empiric coverage.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Wean Levophed as needed
    Respiratory failure:  ARDS net ventilation.  Esophageal balloon placed
   for transpleural pressure monitoring
   - Wean Fi02, PEEP as tolerated
   - Wean down F1O2 as tolerated.
   Hepatorenal Syndrome: EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Liver/Renal function remains stable.  Patient continues
   on CVVH.
   - Supportive care
   - Holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   - Patient on Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for treatment
   - Patient on CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated
   Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy/Liver failure: likely due to liver
   failure.  Coagulation parameters still elevated although improving.
   - Cryo for fibrinogen < 100.
   - Continually increasing indirect bilirubin and may be due to poor
   conjugation rather than hemolysis.
   - Liver following; continuing supportive care for now. Subsequent liver
   problems as below.
   Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with ARDS, sepsis, liver, and renal failure. She initially presented with presumed right lower lobe pneumonia but appeared to recover radiographically and objectively while on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Flagyl was added empirically on [2112-12-1] and her leukocytosis is decreasing. She remains afebrile over the past 24 hours.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 100/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on FiO2 60%. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 360 mL, RR set at 32, PEEP at 20 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, PIP at 35 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 31 cmH2O. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation is 74%.

The patient has received several blood products, including 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate due to an INR of 5.8 and fibrinogen of 100. Her lactic acid levels are steadily increasing, and she has been placed on a bicarbonate infusion. Her arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis (HCV/etoh) awaiting liver transplant presenting with sepsis, liver failure, and ARDS. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and not hypotensive initially. The source of infection is likely pneumonia based on history and developing left lower lobe infiltrate. 

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics including Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin, and Flagyl. Chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral patchy infiltrates, which may be pulmonary edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient is receiving ARDSnet low tidal volume ventilation and high PEEP titrated via esophageal balloon. 

The patient had 850cc of transudate removed from the right pleural space. Despite this, the patient remains hypoxic with ARDS and a baseline pulmonary shunt based on an earlier echo. The patient also has acute renal failure not responsive to fluids, with ongoing anuria. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been started. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 92/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's central venous pressure (C"

   vs HRS-- Started on CVVH, still anuric.  FiO2 was at 90% with 22 PEEP
   (titrated per esophageal balloon) but much better today--FiO2 down to
   50% with PaO2 still in 90s.  Also less desating with turning suggesting
   less shunting.  Will keep on 50% and 22 PEEP tonite and if remains

","The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis due to HCV and ethanol abuse, awaiting liver transplantation. She presented with sepsis, liver failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The source of infection is likely pneumonia, based on history and developing left lower lobe infiltrate. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco, Zosyn, Levaquin, Flagyl) and receiving mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume and high PEEP on the ARDSnet protocol. She has also undergone right pleural decortication with 850cc of transudate removed. The patient remains hypoxic with ARDS and a baseline pulmonary shunt based on an earlier echo. She has acute renal failure not responsive to fluids, with ongoing anuria. The patient is on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and requires low-dose levophed to maintain blood pressure during CVVH. Her liver function remains tenuous with coagulopathy and low fibrinogen. The patient has been given FFP and cryoprecipitate for elevated coagulation parameters and low fibrinogen. She is also on bicarbonate gtt with pH of 7.2 and lactate 8. Allergies include penicillins, Demerol (Injection) (Meperidine Hcl), and unspecified allergen. The last doses of antibiotics were given at [**2112"

   Sepsis: Patient initially with presumed RLL pna that appeared to
   resolve radiographically and objectively while on broad spectrum abx.
   Workup thus far negative for organism. Flagyl was empirically added on
   [**2112-12-1**] and her leuckocytosis is decreasing. She remains afebrile over
   the past 24 hours.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levoquin for empiric coverage.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Wean Levophed as needed
   Respiratory failure: ARDS net ventilation. Esophageal balloon placed
   for transpleural pressure monitoring
   - Wean Fi02, PEEP as tolerated
   - Wean down F1O2 as tolerated.
   Hepatorenal Syndrome: EtOH and HepC cirrhosis, history of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Liver/Renal function remains stable. Patient continues
   on CVVH.
   - Supportive care
   - Holding lasix/aldactone in setting of hepatorenal syndrome
   - Patient on Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin for treatment
   - Patient on CVVH for fluid removal if tolerated
   Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy/Liver failure: likely due to liver
   failure. Coagulation parameters still elevated although improving.
   - Cryo for fibrinogen < 100.
   - Continually increasing indirect bilirubin and may be due to poor
   conjugation rather than hemolysis.
   - Liver following; continuing supportive care for now. Subsequent liver
   problems as below.
   Hypoglycemia: trending toward being unable to maintain blood sugar
   levels likely secondary to ongoing liver failure and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Switching to anaerobic metabolism that we are reversing by
   doing D10 gtt and checking more frequent fingersticks.
   - D10 gtt
   - Follow lactates
   Migraines: Will hold at this time.
   Depression: hold paxil at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a chief complaint of shock. She remains intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient has been receiving multiple organ support, including blood products and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

24-hour events:
- The patient received additional products to support ongoing multiorgan liver failure.
- She received 1 unit of platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- The patient's INR was 10.0, indicating a significant coagulation abnormality.
- Her hemoglobin level was 18.0 g/dL, which is high.
- She continues to have hypoglycemia requiring D10 gtt (a solution of dextrose in water).
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 95/28 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal tube ventilation.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 9,766 mL and output of 10,306 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -540 mL.
- The patient has been receiving several medications, including calcium gluconate, norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam, and potassium chloride via CRRT.
- Laboratory results indicate"
