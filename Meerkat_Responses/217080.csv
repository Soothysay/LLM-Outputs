   and found to have hypotension and fever and intubated for hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory distress
 Precipitant likely not being on
   regular BIPAP overnight.  Also has developed element of volume overload
   on CXR.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.  PMH, SH, FH and ROS are
   unchanged from admission except where noted above and below.
   Extubated sucessfully. Normotensive.
   Confusing picture of hypercarbic resp failure and hypotension with only
   mild initial presentation/ history- UTI and missing one night BiPAP.
   Seems multifactorial with contribution of UTI, dehydration, chronic
   resp failure in setting of steroid-dependent panhypopit. Cr returning
   to baseline with hydration.
   Critically ill as mech vent this am, extubated, continue to monitor
   resp status- tenuous oxygenation.
   Need improved control of HTN.
   Time: 30 minutes.

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of panhypopituitarism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), pulmonary hypertension (PHN), and diastolic heart failure. The patient presented with headaches, hypotension, and fever and was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/75mmHg to 92/58mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on multi-lumen invasive ventilation, set at pressure-controlled mode with a pressure of 20 cmH2O initially, which was tapered overnight. The plan is to perform a rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) test this morning and consider extubation if possible.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 184 mL and output of 305 mL over 24 hours. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, sodium of 137 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 130 mg/dL, and platelet count of 182 K/uL.

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with panhypopituitarism, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic heart failure. She was admitted with complaints of headache and found to have hypotension and fever, leading to intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/75 mmHg to 92/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and on invasive ventilation.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including propofol infusion, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated blood glucose.

The assessment and plan include managing hypercarbic respiratory distress, resolving hypotension, addressing panhypopituitarism, managing hypertension, and monitoring renal function. The patient also has cardiac issues, including ischemia, pump dysfunction, and rhythm disturbances.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, and atelectasis due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. The patient's obesity and hypo"

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of panhypopituitarism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), pulmonary hypertension (PH), and diastolic heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently intubated.

Overnight, she developed an element of volume overload on chest X-ray. Her respiratory support has been switched from assist-control (AC) to pressure support (PS) ventilation, initially set at 20 cmH2O and tapered throughout the night. The plan for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning and possible extubation if tolerated.

Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/75 to 92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on multi-lumen IV access, receiving propofol infusion at 8 mcg/kg/min, and various other medications including heparin sodium.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.2 g/dL, sodium (Na) of 137 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 5.1 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 109 mEq/L,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including panhypopituitarism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity, hypoventilation, pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic heart failure. The patient presented with headaches and was found to have hypotension and fever, leading to intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been extubated successfully.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of hypoventilation and obesity puts her at risk for hypercarbic respiratory distress. Regular use of BiPAP at night is recommended to prevent this complication.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which has now resolved. However, it is essential to continue monitoring her blood pressure and adjust treatment as needed.
3. Panhypopituitarism: The patient requires ongoing management of her panhypopituitarism, including monitoring thyroid hormone levels and continuing levothyroxine replacement therapy, steroid replacement, and desmopressin administration.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has become hypertensive, and appropriate antihypertensive medication should be restarted to manage this condition.
5. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic dysfunction, which needs to be closely monitored and controlled to prevent further pulmonary edema.
6. Ischemia: Although there are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of panhypopituitarism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and diastolic heart failure. She presented with headaches and was found to have hypotension and fever, leading to intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been on invasive ventilation but is now being weaned off as tolerated, with plans for extubation in the morning. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 142/77 mmHg to 165/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory distress: The patient initially required intubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a potential complication of reintubation if she experiences respiratory failure again.
2. Volume overload: The patient has developed an element of volume overload on chest X-ray. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen heart failure symptoms.
3. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which has since resolved. However, there is a potential risk of recurrent hypotension, especially if the underlying cause is not fully addressed.
4. Hypert"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.  PMH, SH, FH and ROS are
   unchanged from admission except where noted above and below. Confusing
   picture of hypercarbic resp failure and hypotension with only mild
   initial presentation/ history- UTI and missing one night BiPAP. Seems
   multifactorial with contribution of UTI, dehydration, chronic resp
   failure in setting of steroid-dependent panhypopit. Cr returning to
   baseline with hydration.
   Extubated sucessfully yesterday morning. Plan 7d course ceftriaxone.
   Added outpt meds for HTN, hypothyroid, panhypopit. Safe for tx to
   floor, need to clarify SpO2 goals considering chronic CO2 retainer.
   Needs BiPAP at outpt settings.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including panhypopituitarism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic heart failure. The patient presented with headaches (HA) and was found to have hypotension and fever, leading to intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient was extubated successfully yesterday morning and has been doing well on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, she needs to continue using BiPAP at night due to her chronic CO2 retention. The patient's blood pressure has fluctuated, initially being hypotensive but now hypertensive. The hypertension is being managed with clonidine and valsartan.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI), which has been treated with antibiotics. She is currently receiving prophylactic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and has multiple lines inserted.

In terms of lab results, the patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has shown a slight variation over time, but remains within normal limits. Other lab parameters such as hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal ranges or show minimal abnormalities.

The patient's cardiac status is being closely monitored, with no"
