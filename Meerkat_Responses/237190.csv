","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of ITP, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and splenomegaly scheduled for splenectomy in March. He presents with DKA and hemolytic anemia. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.1 F, heart rate of 103-133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/69-125/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, mild hepatomegaly, and no cyanosis or gross dermatitis.

The patient's lab results show elevated hemoglobin levels, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The WBC count has been increasing over time. The assessment and plan include managing diabetes mellitus type I, hemolytic anemia, fever, and potential complications such as DKA, hypoglycemia, infection, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemolytic Anemia: The patient has a history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which can cause anemia and jaundice. It is important to monitor his hematocrit levels regularly and transfuse packed red blood cells as needed to maintain an adequate hemoglobin level"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and splenomegaly scheduled for splenectomy in March. He presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hemolytic anemia. The patient has been experiencing difficulty controlling his blood sugar levels in the 400s over the past three days. His fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate a potential infection. The patient is currently normotensive, but has a history of hypertension. He also has hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and is being treated for diabetic endocrinopathy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 105/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving insulin via a continuous infusion and has received two units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate hematocrit bump. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's autoimmune hemolytic anemia may worsen due to recent immunizations triggering an autoimmune response. He has a history of similar episodes controlled with steroids. Monitoring for transfusion reactions is necessary as he has warm autoantibodies, making cross"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of anemia, hemolysis, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's medical history includes type I diabetes mellitus (DM), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and anemia. Upon admission, the patient was found to have hyperglycemia, anemia, and evidence of hemolysis. The patient's acidosis has resolved, but their glucose levels remain elevated, prompting adjustments to the insulin infusion. The patient is receiving transfusions to address the anemia and is being treated with steroids. A plan for splenectomy has been made this week. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a fever recorded at 101.1°F. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, and the patient's oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their blood pressure is within normal limits. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for hyperglycemia and anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, potential medical complications for this patient may include:

1. Hypoglycemia: Since the patient is receiving an insulin infusion, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the dosage is not appropriately adjusted.
2. Infection: The presence of a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old overweight male with a chief complaint of hemolytic anemia. The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight and is complaining of mild fatigue and abdominal discomfort. The patient also reports puffiness. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus (DM), type I, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new symptoms mentioned above.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and obesity. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 105 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 142/89 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient has sinus tachycardia on ECG. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,121 mL and total output of 2,100 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,021 mL. The patient is receiving insulin, famotidine, heparin sodium, and methylprednisolone.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.2 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 11.2-20.4 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 619 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.5-0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 180-335 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits. The patient's hct is relatively stable at 20%.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has diabetes mellitus (DM), type I, hemolytic anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The patient's hct is stable, but the non-pitting edema developed on steroids, and the BUN/Creat ratio is elevated consistent with intravascular volume deficit. The patient is also experiencing thirst.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with insulin infusion, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and the planned disposition is transfer to the floor."

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and splenomegaly. He presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hemolytic anemia. The patient's blood glucose levels have been difficult to control, with readings in the 400s last night and this morning. His white blood cell count is rising, indicating a possible infection. The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal range, so antihypertensives have been held. His liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, so statin therapy for hyperlipidemia has been held. The patient is scheduled for a splenectomy today. He requires close monitoring and management of his diabetes, hemolytic anemia, and potential infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes that requires prompt treatment.
2. Hemolytic anemia - The patient's history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia may worsen during the splenectomy procedure or due to recent immunizations, leading to further anemia and potential complications.
3. Infection - The rising white blood cell count suggests an ongoing or impending infection, which can be dangerous in a patient with compromised immune"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes mellitus (DM), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and splenomegaly. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hemolytic anemia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 144/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 335 mg/dL.

The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to his hemolytic anemia. He has warm autoantibodies, which makes crossmatching difficult. The patient is scheduled for a splenectomy in March.

The plan of care includes monitoring hemodynamic status, maintaining hemoglobin above 20 g/dL, and closely monitoring for transfusion reactions. The patient is also receiving IV solumedrol, folate supplementation, and continuous insulin infusion for DKA management.

Other assessments and plans include fever and elevated white blood cell count, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with insulin infusion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and splenomegaly. He is currently admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hemolytic anemia. The patient is scheduled for a splenectomy in March. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemolytic anemia: The patient has a history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which has been controlled with steroids and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the past. Given his warm autoantibodies, crossmatching for blood transfusion is difficult. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed to keep Hct above 20% is recommended. Monitoring for transfusion reactions is also important.

2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's blood glucose levels have been difficult to control, reaching the 400s. Continuous insulin infusion should be maintained for glycemic control. Further recommendations from the endocrinologist are pending.

3. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC): The patient's WBC count is rising, likely due to steroid use. Follow-up blood and urine cultures are needed to assess for any potential infections.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, so antihypertensive medications should be held temporarily"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual with a chief complaint of hemolytic anemia. The patient underwent a splenectomy yesterday and returned extubated. They were transfused with 3 units of blood intraoperatively and had a post-operative hematocrit (Hct) of 28. The patient's Hct continues to trend down, and they will be transfused if it drops below 21 or in case of a rapid drop. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and received a tetanus shot in 2010. They are currently on insulin, morphine sulfate, and pantoprazole. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain. Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's fluid balance is within acceptable limits. Respiratory support includes medium concentration mask with oxygen and an ABG indicating a slightly low pH level. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetrical chest expansion, clear breath sounds, tender midline incision with minimal oozing, trace edema in both extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated potassium levels. Other lab results"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and splenomegaly. He presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hemolytic anemia. The patient underwent an uneventful splenectomy and received 3 units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively. His hematocrit (Hct) is currently stable at 24%. The plan includes monitoring hemolytic anemia, managing DKA, and addressing other medical conditions such as fever, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently on insulin infusion for glycemic control, and his blood glucose levels are being monitored. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated post-op but has now decreased to 31. The patient is expected to remain in the ICU until he can be transferred off insulin gtt.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's autoimmune hemolytic anemia may worsen or lead to further complications if not properly managed.
2. DKA: There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of DKA if insulin therapy is not continued appropriately.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count indicates a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and conducting further investigations is necessary.
4. Hypoglycemia: Ins"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and splenomegaly. He presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hemolytic anemia. The patient underwent a splenectomy on POD #2. He is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues that require management.

Medical Complications:
1. Hemolytic anemia: The patient has a history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which can cause a decrease in hemoglobin levels and anemia. His Hct continues to trend down to 20 this morning. He will be transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with lasix between and after 2 units today. Hct checks will be done every 6 hours, and the patient will be monitored for transfusion reactions.

2. DKA: Although the patient's sugar levels overnight were stable at 80, his blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 80 and 300. He is currently on 6 units per hour of insulin gtt. It is planned to transition him back to insulin pump or subcutaneous insulin today. The patient cannot be transferred to the floor on insulin gtt.

3. Fever/elevated WBC: The patient's white blood cell count was initially elevated at 38 post-op"
