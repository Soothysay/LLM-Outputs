   Assessment and Plan
   60M with Wegener's granulomatosis who presents with tachycardia,
   shortness of breath, and fever.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: CXR is unimpressive for PNA, however, patient
   was dry on presentation so radiographic findings may lag clinical
   presentation.  Atypical infection such as viral, flu, PCP or fungal is
   high on differential given his immunocompromised state.  PE is also on
   ddx, espicially given persistant tachycardia and b/l LE edema.  The
   patient has moderate underlying obstructive lung disease, and very
   little respiratory reserve.  Given fall in Hct from baseline of 30, DAH
   is also on differential.
   - non contrast CT chest to assess for parenchymal disease
   - bilateral LENIs to look for DVT
   - continue ctx/azithro to cover CAP
   - supplemental O2 to maintain O2 sat >93%
   - consider bronchoscopy if worsenes
   - add on LDH, b glucan for ?PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] empiric tx for now
   - continue PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], INH
   - rapid resp to rule out flu
   - droplet precautions
   - nebs
   .
   # Renal: CKD due to vasculitic renal complications and RPGN with
   baseline Cr 2.0-2.3, currently 2.9.
   -given IVF in ED
   -follow Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxins as able
   -renal consult tonight to look at sediment for ?Wegener's flair
   .
   # Wegener's granulomatosis: Had incomplete induction therapy with
   Cytoxan (aborted due to side effect), currently on prednisone 50 daily
   with bactrim TIW prophylaxis.  His current illness may represent a
   flair of his disease.  ANCA was resent [**12-19**].
   -stress dose steroids while acutely ill
   -renal consult as above
   .
   # Anemia: baseline 30, currently at 25.3.  Blood in urine suggests
   flair of vasculitis; thus also must be concerned for DAH, though no
   hemoptysis.
   -UA/UCx
   -urine sediment
   -guaic all stools
   -active T+crossmatch
   -consider bronch if clinical decompensation
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Patient has a h/o pancytopenia, thought to be due to
   cytoxan previously. He has an unexplained low CD4 count, most recently
   *4* on [**11-6**].  HIV was negative as recently as [**10-5**].
   -trend labs
   -consider heme consult
   .
   # Latent Tb: continue INH and pyridoxine
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, sips tonight while resp status so
   tenuous

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with Wegener's granulomatosis who presented with respiratory distress, tachycardia, and fever. The patient has a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, pancytopenia, and renal complications. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath and crackles on examination, indicating a possible pneumonia or atypical infection such as viral, flu, PCP, or fungal. There is also a concern for pulmonary embolism given the persistent tachycardia and bilateral lower extremity edema.

2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased from 30 to 25.3, suggesting a worsening of anemia. This could be due to a flair of vasculitis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DAH). 

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has a history of pancytopenia, which is a decrease in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can be caused by previous chemotherapy (cytoxan) or other underlying conditions.

4. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient's current illness may represent a flair of his underlying autoimmune disease, Wegener's granulomatosis. This condition can cause kidney damage, respiratory problems,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with Wegener's granulomatosis who presented with tachycardia, shortness of breath, and fever. The patient has underlying obstructive lung disease and very little respiratory reserve. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's symptoms of tachypnea, crackles on exam, and wheezes suggest a possible respiratory infection or exacerbation of underlying obstructive lung disease. The use of supplemental oxygen and nebulizers may help maintain oxygen saturation above 93% and provide bronchodilation.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has a history of pancytopenia, which could be due to previous chemotherapy (cytoxan) or contribution from Bactrim. The drop in all blood lines overnight might be dilutional, but it cannot explain the drop from recent baseline. A trend in labs, heme consult, active T+crossmatch, and transfusion of 2 units today are recommended.

3. Renal complications: The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to vasculitic renal complications and RPGN with baseline creatinine (Cr) 2.0-2.3, currently at 2.9. Renal consultation last night found inconclusive sediment for Wegeners. Following Cr levels, avoiding nephrotoxins as able, appreciating renal recommendations, and considering bronchoscopic evaluation if clinical decompensation are advised.

4. Wegener's granulomatosis: The patient had incomplete induction therapy with Cytoxan (aborted due to side effects), currently on prednisone 50 daily with Bactrim TIW prophylaxis. Stress dose steroids while acutely ill, renal and rheum consults, and considering bronchoscopic evaluation if clinical decompensation are recommended.

5. Latent Tb: The patient should continue INH and pyridoxine.

6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has received 3 liters of normal saline, and their fluid balance is negative 575 mL since 12 AM. Frequent assessment of electrolyte levels and monitoring for any signs of fluid overload or dehydration is necessary.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

8. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is on PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation. Frequent respiratory assessment and appropriate antibiotic coverage are essential.

10. Code status: The patient has a presumed full code status.

11. Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds, and a family meeting has been held.

12. Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU pending stabilization."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) who presented with malaise, weakness, fever, and dyspnea. He has been found to have acute-on-chronic renal failure and is positive for parainfluenza in respiratory secretions. The non-contrast chest CT suggests atypical infection and does not appear consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) or typical bacterial pneumonia (PNA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and fever, along with the findings of atypical infection on chest CT, indicate a potential respiratory complication. This could be due to a viral or bacterial infection, possibly exacerbated by the underlying Wegener's granulomatosis.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, which may be contributing to his overall condition. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and severity of renal failure, whether it is pre-renal, intrinsic renal, or due to glomerulonephritis.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count indicate pancytopenia. This could be related to prior chemotherapy or antibiotic use, but further investigation is necessary to determine the exact etiology.

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Wegener's Granulomatosis (WG) who presented with malaise, weakness, fever, and dyspnea. He has been diagnosed with acute on chronic renal failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments and medications.

24-hour events include negative Lower Extremity Venous Injection (LENI) for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a drop in Hematocrit (HCT) after hydration, repeat HCT of 22, negative Guaiac test, administration of 2 units packed red blood cells (PRBC) and lasix, renal evaluation with indeterminant urine sediment, chest CT, and ongoing dyspnea without relief from nebulizers (nebs).

The patient has allergies to vancomycin and thrombocytopenia. He is currently receiving multiple infusions and other medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), ceftriaxone, azithromycin, thiamine, pyridoxine, iron, Tums, Bactrim, solute 80mg every 6 hours, protonix, isoniazid (INH), atrovent, calcitriol, lopressor, and rissole.

Review of systems and physical examination findings are largely unchanged from admission, with the exception of respiratory distress and abnormal vital signs.

   failure.
   Dyspnea/Fever:  Non-contrast Chest CT overnight suggests atypical
   infection.  Does not appear consistent with DAH or typical bacterial
   PNA.
     -Continue empiric CAP coverage with ceftriaxone/azithromycin, will
   add Vanco if clinical decline
     -F/u Resp viral panel.  If flu positive, no indication for tamiflu
   given timing of onset of symptoms and high resistance rate in strains

     -Induced sputum for regular culture and PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] keep on
   prophylactic doses of bactrim for now but low threshold for changing to
   treatment dosing.

     [**Name9 (PRE) **] ANCA titer
     -PRN nebs(xopenex given tachycardia)
     -Continue on IV steroids for now.
   Renal Failure:  Pre-renal vs intrinsic renal (ATN, vasculitis).  Per
   renal, sediment was indeterminant for GN.  Creatinine slightly down
   today with hydration.
     - he is coming to HD soon given nephrotic range proteinuria
     -Continue hydration today.
   HCT drop:  No evidence of DAH on CT.  Guiac negative.  Possibly just
   dilutional
     -Serial HCT today.
   Pancytopenia:  Etiology unclear, ? from prior cytoxan +/- Bactrim use
     -Heme consult today.
   Tachycardia:  Appears to be sinus ( hypovolemia, fevers, tachypnea all

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with Wegener's granulomatosis who presents with tachycardia, shortness of breath, and fever. He has a history of pancytopenia, thought to be due to cytoxan previously, with possible contribution from Bactrim. The patient also has a low CD4 count and a recent positive parainfluenza viral antigen test. He is currently experiencing respiratory distress, and there are concerns about potential complications such as respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and other cardiac issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing moderate underlying obstructive lung disease and has very little respiratory reserve. Parainfluenza infection could worsen his respiratory distress, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating chronic kidney disease. His current creatinine level is 2.9, which suggests acute renal failure. The renal function should be closely monitored, and nephrotoxic medications should be avoided.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has a persistent tachycardia, which may be related to his underlying condition, infection, or other factors. The heart rhythm is atrial flutter, and the patient's blood pressure is low.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has a history of pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all types of blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis who presents with tachycardia, shortness of breath, and fever. The patient has moderate underlying obstructive lung disease and very little respiratory reserve. The respiratory distress is likely caused by parainfluenza infection, and other possible infections such as viral, H flu, or fungal should be considered, including PCP. The patient has a low CD4 count and a history of pancytopenia, which could be due to previous cytoxan treatment or Bactrim use. There is also a drop in all blood lines overnight, which may be dilutional but cannot explain the recent baseline drop. The patient has chronic kidney disease due to vasculitic renal complications and RPGN with a baseline creatinine level of 2.0-2.3, currently at 2.9. The patient is currently on prednisone 50 daily with bactrim TIW prophylaxis for Wegener's granulomatosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and underlying obstructive lung disease put him at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support, such as supplemental oxygen and nebulizers, should be provided.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates acute renal failure. Renal consultation is necessary for further evaluation and management. Avoiding neph"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, admitted with respiratory distress and diagnosed with Parainfluenza. He has acute renal failure on top of chronic kidney disease, likely due to vasculitic complications of Wegener's and RPGN. The patient also has pancytopenia, thought to be caused by previous treatment with Cytoxan and possible contribution from Bactrim. His CD4 count is low, and HIV was negative as recently as October 5th. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased breath sounds with wheezing. Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels, low white blood cell count, and decreased platelet count. Imaging shows possible developing pneumonic consolidation at the right lung base and chronic bullous emphysema. The patient's respiratory viral identification test was positive for Parainfluenza type 2 viral antigen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to Parainfluenza infection. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, especially considering his moderate underlying obstructive lung disease and very little respiratory reserve.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is an exacerbation of chronic kidney disease caused by vasculitic complications of Wegener's and RPGN. There is a risk of further deterioration of renal function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), presenting with malaise, weakness, fever, and dyspnea. He is currently in acute on chronic renal failure and positive for parainfluenza in respiratory secretions. The patient has uncontrolled atrial fibrillation and presents with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and tachycardia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and fever, along with positive parainfluenza in respiratory secretions, indicate respiratory failure. This could be due to the viral infection causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and oxygen support are necessary to manage respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's history of Wegener's granulomatosis, elevated creatinine levels, and nephrotic range proteinuria suggest acute renal failure. This could be caused by pre-renal or intrinsic renal damage, possibly due to vasculitis or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal function, hydration, and consideration for dialysis are important.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt) indicate pancytopenia. This could be due to prior cytoxan and Bactrim use, acute infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Wegeners Granulomatosis (WG) who presented with malaise, weakness, fever, and dyspnea. The patient is on chronic renal failure and is now positive for parainfluenza in respiratory secretions. The patient has atrial fibrillation that is uncontrolled.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Dyspnea/Fever: Parainfluenza infection. Supportive care, oxygen, nebulizers, chest physical therapy, mucinex, and xopenex are recommended. A CT chest with atypical infection should be done. Antibiotics should be continued due to underlying parenchymal disease, and sputum should be sent for culture.
2. Renal Failure: Pre-renal versus intrinsic renal failure needs to be determined. Hydration should be continued, and daily urine analysis should be done to check for muddy casts. Hemodialysis should be considered given nephrotic range proteinuria.
3. HCT drop: Serial HCT today, and transfusion should be done to keep Hct at > 25.
4. Pancytopenia: Etiology unclear, possibly from prior cytoxan +/- Bactrim use+/- acute infection. Follow-up with the hematology department and check for parvovirus.

   # Respiratory distress: RRVS positive for Parainfluenza. CT Chest c/w
   bronchiolitis. The patient has moderate underlying obstructive lung
   disease, and very little respiratory reserve.  Clinically improving
   with supportive care.
   - continue ctx/azithro to complete 7 day course for possible
   co-infection/CAP per ID recs, less likely as presentation c/w viral
   process, will continue abx pending sputum culture, RT will retry
   induced sputum today
   - supplemental O2 to maintain O2 sat >93%
   - continue nebs, change albuterol to xoponex given tachycardia
   - add mucinex to aid with expectorating secretions
   - glucan/galactomannan pending, legionella and crypto negative
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Patient has a h/o pancytopenia, thought to be due to
   cytoxan previously, with possible contribution from Bactrim. He has an
   unexplained low CD4 count, most recently *4* on [**11-6**].  HIV was
   negative as recently as [**10-5**].   BM biopsy in past w/ normocellular
   marrow, thought toxin induced suppression.  Rectal guaic negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, admitted with respiratory distress due to Parainfluenza infection. He also has acute renal failure on chronic renal disease, likely due to ATN. His current medications include Atovaquone, Mucinex, Diltiazem, and Xopenex nebs. The patient has pancytopenia with a low CD4 count and previous negative HIV test. He has been diagnosed with Wegener's granulomatosis, acute on chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation (converted to sinus rhythm), latent TB, and possible fen. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is expected to continue with supportive care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress due to Parainfluenza infection. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory symptoms if the infection spreads or if there are complications such as pneumonia.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient has a history of pancytopenia, which can lead to an increased risk of infections, bleeding, and anemia.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic renal disease. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, kidney damage, and the need for dialysis.
4. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has Wegener's gran"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and tachycardia. The patient has a history of immunosuppression and is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 67-133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/75-136/98 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 15-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,770 mL and output of 1,525 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 245 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 95 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly elevated white blood cell count. The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated serum creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL. The patient's respiratory status appears stable with normal oxygen saturation and an ABG showing pH of 7.26. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and the skin examination is also not performed. The patient is receiving supportive care for likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is being monitored closely for any signs of complications."

   bronchiolitis. The patient has moderate underlying obstructive lung
   disease, and very little respiratory reserve.  Clinically improving
   with supportive care.
   - continue ctx/azithro to cover CAP, less likely as presentation c/w
   viral process, will continue abx pending sputum culture, RT will retry
   induced sputum today
   - supplemental O2 to maintain O2 sat >93%
   - continue nebs, change albuterol to xoponex given tachycardia
   - add mucinex to aid with expectorating secretions

   # Pancytopenia: Patient has a h/o pancytopenia, thought to be due to
   cytoxan previously, with possible contribution from Bactrim. He has an
   unexplained low CD4 count, most recently *4* on [**11-6**].  HIV was
   negative as recently as [**10-5**].   BM biopsy in past w/ normocellular

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with Wegener's granulomatosis admitted with respiratory distress, now with acute renal failure. The patient has a history of pancytopenia and low CD4 count. He is currently being treated with supportive care, including supplemental oxygen, nebulizers, and mucinex. The patient's labs show an elevated creatinine level and abnormal white blood cell count. He has pending tests for fungal, viral, and Legionella cultures, as well as ANCA titers. The patient's medical history includes Wegener's granulomatosis, chronic kidney disease, and latent tuberculosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could potentially lead to further complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia increases the risk of bleeding and infection.
4. Wegener's Granulomatosis Flare: There is a possibility of a flare-up of the patient's underlying autoimmune disease, which could affect multiple organ systems.
5. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state, he is at an increased risk of developing infections, including opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) or fungal infections.
6. Thrombotic Events: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy, but there is still a risk of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
7. Drug Reactions: Considering the patient's history of drug-induced pancytopenia, there is a risk of adverse drug reactions to current medications.

Note: The potential medical complications listed above are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Wegener's Granulomatosis (WG) who presented with malaise, weakness, fever, and dyspnea. The patient has acute on chronic renal failure and tested positive for parainfluenza in respiratory secretions. He was previously in mild failure with atrial fibrillation but has been converted to sinus rhythm with beta blockers and diltiazem.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications, including:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is showing signs of acute respiratory failure, which may be attributed to the parainfluenza infection.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. This could be due to the underlying conditions or complications such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, indicating tachycardia. It is likely a result of the overall illness and may be influenced by the patient's conversion to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation.

The assessment and plan include:
- Continue Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone for superinfection for seven days as per ID.
- Perform induced sputum pending and PCP (Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) prophylaxis with atovaquone due to leukopenia.
- Provide supportive care for parainfluenza infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Wegener's Granulomatosis (WG) who presented with malaise, weakness, fever, and dyspnea. He has acute on chronic renal failure, positive for parainfluenza in respiratory secretions, and is currently in mild heart failure with atrial fibrillation, now converted to sinus rhythm with beta-blocker and diltiazem. The patient's breathing status is slowly improving but remains tenuous even on nebs and solumedrol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has positive parainfluenza in respiratory secretions, indicating a possible respiratory infection. This could lead to pneumonia if not properly managed.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is described as having acute on chronic renal failure. AKI can worsen the patient's condition and may require renal replacement therapy (RRT).
3. Leukopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, which increases the risk of infections.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient also has low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, suggesting a possible bone marrow issue or previous cytotoxic drug use.
5. Heart Failure: Although the patient's heart rhythm has been converted to sinus rhythm, he still has mild heart failure. If not managed appropriately, it could progress to severe heart failure.
