   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML s/p
   chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be a low
   grade B cell lymphoma complicated by anastomotic leak and
   intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain placement and washout
   with surgical drain placement now readmitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 29**] ICU for
   hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely  due  to sepsis/SIRS (tachycardia, leukocytosis)
   and intravascular volume depletion secondary to bleeding and
   hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2).  She received 4u PRBC
   yesterday/overnight with hct this AM of 27.6.   Given degree of
   leukocytosis, likely combination of pre-existing MDS with superimposed
   infectious process and less likely leukemoid reaction.  Patient has had
   C.diff negative x1 in past week.  Given degree of leukocytosis,
   concerning for intra-abdominal abscess/infection versus C.diff colitis
   with increasing ostomy output.
   - Continue IV vanco, flagyl, pip/tazo
   - Add PO vanco for empiric C. diff coverage
   - Daily vanco AM levels, dose as needed with goal 15-20.
   - CT torso today.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, monitor UOP.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Check stool C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2
   - If continues to be hypotensive, bolus as necessary with
   crystalloid/pRBC. Patient may require additional CVL access as she only
   has a PICC with one usable port.
   - Will discuss with [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit up top 27.6 this AM.  Given recent history of
   abdominal surgery and bloody ostomy output, likely is due to bleeding.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 4u PRBC yesterday.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   .
   # Post-op/anastomotic leak: As above. Currently hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Morphine prn.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Received 1u FFP prior to transfer to ICU for INR of
   1.7.  She has also received 10 mg PO and 2 mg IV last night.  Likely
   due to combination of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis. INR this
   AM of 1.7.
   - Trend coags
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient developed ARF post-op likely secondary
   to ATN from intra-operative hypotension.  Creatinine continues to rise
   to 4.4 with potassium to 5.8 this AM.
   - Trend creatinine
   - ECG to assess for hyperkalemic changes.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Per renal, dose with IV lasix
   - Follow-up with renal regarding rising creatinine and potassium
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy either today or Monday.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, send Bcr-Abl today
   .
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.
   - Follow-up with Onc

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post chemotherapy and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be a low-grade B cell lymphoma complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses. She was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday with a hematocrit (Hct) this morning of 27.6. She has also received 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to transfer to the ICU for an INR of 1.7. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis/SIRS (tachycardia, leukocytosis) and intravascular volume depletion secondary to bleeding and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2). The patient received 4 units of PRBC yesterday, and her Hct this morning is 27.6. If the patient continues to be hypotensive, she may require additional central venous line (CVL) access as she only has a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) with one usable port.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post chemotherapy and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be low-grade B cell lymphoma complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses. She was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis. The patient received 2u PRBC today with hematocrit increase to 19.4, suggesting continued bleeding or hemolysis. She has ongoing symptoms of anemia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, and potential complications from previous surgeries. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to being NPO.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis. Continued monitoring of vital signs, trends in WBC count, and infection control measures are essential.
2. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels indicate ongoing blood loss or hemolysis. Repeated Hct checks and further investigation for the cause of anemia are necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR indicates a bleeding tendency. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management with blood products are crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML s/p
   chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be a low
   grade B cell lymphoma complicated by anastomotic leak and
   intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain placement and washout
   with surgical drain placement now readmitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 29**] ICU for
   hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis/SIRS (tachycardia,
   leukocytosis) and intravascular volume depletion secondary to bleeding
   and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2).  She received 2u PRBC today with
   hematocrit increase to 19.4, suggesting continued bleeding or
   hemolysis.  Given degree of leukocytosis, likely combination of
   pre-existing MDS with superimposed infectious process and less likely
   leukemoid reaction.  Patient has had C.diff negative x1 recently.
   Given degree of leukocytosis, concerning for intra-abdominal
   abscess/infection versus C.diff colitis with increasing ostomy output.
   - Continue IV vanco, flagyl, pip/tazo
   - Add PO vanco for empiric C. diff coverage
   - Daily vanco AM levels, dose as needed with goal 15-20.
   - Pan-culture, C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2
   - Repeat CXR
   - Discussed with surgical resident, and plan for CT torso tomorrow.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, monitor UOP.
   - Check lactate and fibrinogen.
   - Transfuse additional 2u PRBC
   - If continues to be hypotensive, bolus as necessary. Patient may
   require additional CVL access as she only has a PICC.
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit today of 17.9 from 28.8 yesterday.  Given recent
   history of abdominal surgery and bloody ostomy output, likely is due to
   bleeding.  Hemolysis labs negative. AM Hct pending. Received 4u PRBC
   yesterday.
   - Recheck hct this AM
   .
   # Post-op/anastomotic leak: As above. Currently hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Morphine and darvocet prn.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Received 1u FFP tonight prior to transfer to ICU for
   INR of 1.7.  She has also received 10 mg PO and 2 mg IV last night.
   - Trend coags
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient developed ARF post-op likely secondary
   to ATN from intra-operative hypotension.  Creatinine rise to 3.9 with
   potassium to 5.5 with no ECG changes.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Follow-up with Renal
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy on Monday.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, send Bcr-Abl
   .
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post-chemotherapy and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be low-grade B cell lymphoma, complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses. The patient underwent image-guided drain placement and washout with surgical drain placement. She was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to sepsis/SIRS (tachycardia, leukocytosis) and intravascular volume depletion secondary to bleeding and hypoalbuminemia. She received 2u PRBC today with hematocrit increase to 19.4, suggesting continued bleeding or hemolysis.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has decreased from 28.8 to 17.9 today, indicating ongoing bleeding. Hemolysis labs are negative. The patient received 4u PRBC yesterday.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient received 1u FFP tonight prior to transfer to the ICU for an INR of 1.7. She also received 10 mg PO and 2 mg IV last night. Trend coags should be monitored.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and had a cecal mass resection with complications including anastomotic leak and colostomy. She was transferred to the ICU last week and was previously on vancomycin and flagyl. Over the past 24 hours, her white blood cell count increased, urine output decreased, and she experienced hypotension, coagulopathy (INR 1.7), and a decrease in hematocrit. She received fluid resuscitation and was given 2 units of blood and 2 mg IV vitamin K. Her hemolysis labs were negative. The patient has a history of allergies to lisinopril and aspirin. She is currently on multiple medications including pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and antibiotics. Her medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Review of systems and physical examination findings are mostly unchanged except for the noted abnormalities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to a combination of hypovolemia (acute blood loss anemia) and sepsis from an intra-abdominal source. Immediate management includes fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions as needed. Antibiotics have been restarted.

2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has increased after blood transfusion. Serial H"

   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**2177-9-27**] 10:00 PM
   - ID: If patient worsens, considering switching from Zosyn to
   meropenem. Add caspofungin for additional coverage. Order more blood
   cultures. Awaiting CT abdomen/pelvis.
   - At 1400, 500cc NS bolus for hypotension (MAP 55-60) and continued
   poor urine output. Per surgery recs, also ordered furosemide 100mg IV
   x1. Anuric - no improvement.
   - Potassium slowly rising overnight to 7.0 at 2200. Per renal, manage
   medically. Given bicarb, insulin with D50, calcium. Lasix as above with
   no effect. EKG check x2 - no acute changes. At 0200, K 5.3.
   - CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
        (1)Interval placement of right upper quadrant anterior approach
   Penrose drain and left lower quadrant diverting ileostomy.
        (2) Large intraperitoneal hematoma; high density possibly also
   partially due to oral contrast extravasation seen on prior CT
   examination.
        (3) Interval development of bilateral hydronephrosis possibly due
   to compression of the ureters by hematoma.
        (4) Decrease in right pleural effusion and resolution of left
   effusion, with improved lung aeration.
        (5) No change in subcutaneous pelvic soft tissue stranding, likely
   due to third spacing.
   - Given CT findings and hypotension requiring starting pressor
   (Levophed, max dose) in addition to acidosis in context of rising
   lactate, taken to OR; returned with open abdomen and intubated. Per
   surgery recs, not to be taken off sedation. Will return to OR on Monday

   cecal mass found to be a low grade B cell lymphoma complicated by
   anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain
   placement and washout with surgical drain placement now readmitted to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening
   leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Given large hematoma noted yesterday on CT, likely
   related to bleeding. Given markedly elevated WBC count and associated
   tachycardia + potential source for infection (abdomen), likely also a
   component of sepsis/SIRS. C. diff negative x1.
   - Continue vancomycin IV and flagyl IV for empiric coverage
   - Per ID recs, d/c Zosyn and begin meropenem given that patient has
   been persistently infected even with Zosyn on board
   - Daily vanc troughs (goal 15-20)
   - D/c vancomycin PO which was started yesterday given concern for C
   diff based on markedly elevated WBC count and no clear source of
   infection
   - Follow cultures, C diff toxin
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Recheck lactate; peaked at ~3.6 today
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs yesterday. Good reason for blood loss anemia
   given large hematomas intraabdominally.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   # Post-op: Dressings changed by surgery.
   - Keep patient intubated and sedated until Monday; at that time will be
   taken back to OR for wound closure.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Coagulopathy: Stable. Given recent surgery, will aim for lower INR.
   Given vitamin K yesterday. Likely due to combination of
   malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Repeat vitamin K this morning
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine continues to rise.
   Potassium elevated as well. Excellent diuresis this morning following
   removal of hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis. Given
   several rounds of calcium, bicarbonate, insulin + D50.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - ECG to assess for hyperkalemic changes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy either today or Monday.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, send Bcr-Abl today

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be low-grade B cell lymphoma. She is currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.

The patient has multiple medical complications including electrolyte and fluid disorder, abdominal pain, acute renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She also has a history of cecal mass, which was diagnosed as low-grade B cell lymphoma, and previously treated AML.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 97/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated and not responsive to stimulation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and creatinine levels, as well as low platelet count and elevated potassium level. Other lab results indicate abnormal liver function tests and elevated D-dimer level.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has a potassium level of 7.0, indicating hyperkalemia. She is receiving insulin with D50 and calcium to manage the electrolyte imbalance.
2. Abdominal"

   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**2177-9-27**] 10:00 PM
   - ID: If patient worsens, considering switching from Zosyn to
   meropenem. Add caspofungin for additional coverage. Order more blood
   cultures. Awaiting CT abdomen/pelvis.
   - At 1400, 500cc NS bolus for hypotension (MAP 55-60) and continued
   poor urine output. Per surgery recs, also ordered furosemide 100mg IV
   x1. Anuric - no improvement.
   - Potassium slowly rising overnight to 7.0 at 2200. Per renal, manage
   medically. Given bicarb, insulin with D50, calcium. Lasix as above with
   no effect. EKG check x2 - no acute changes. At 0200, K 5.3.
   - CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
        (1)Interval placement of right upper quadrant anterior approach
   Penrose drain and left lower quadrant diverting ileostomy.
        (2) Large intraperitoneal hematoma; high density possibly also
   partially due to oral contrast extravasation seen on prior CT
   examination.
        (3) Interval development of bilateral hydronephrosis possibly due
   to compression of the ureters by hematoma.
        (4) Decrease in right pleural effusion and resolution of left
   effusion, with improved lung aeration.
        (5) No change in subcutaneous pelvic soft tissue stranding, likely
   due to third spacing.
   - Given CT findings and hypotension requiring starting pressor
   (Levophed, max dose) in addition to acidosis in context of rising
   lactate, taken to OR; returned with open abdomen and intubated. Per
   surgery recs, not to be taken off sedation. Will return to OR on Monday

   intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain placement and washout
   with surgical drain placement now readmitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 29**] ICU for
   hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Likely due to sepsis/SIRS (tachycardia, leukocytosis)
   and intravascular volume depletion secondary to bleeding and
   hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2).  She received 4u PRBC
   yesterday/overnight with hct this AM of 27.6.   Given degree of
   leukocytosis, likely combination of pre-existing MDS with superimposed
   infectious process and less likely leukemoid reaction.  Patient has had
   C.diff negative x1 in past week.  Given degree of leukocytosis,
   concerning for intra-abdominal abscess/infection versus C.diff colitis
   with increasing ostomy output.
   - Continue IV vanco, flagyl, pip/tazo
   - Add PO vanco for empiric C. diff coverage
   - Daily vanco AM levels, dose as needed with goal 15-20.

   - Check venous lactate.
   - Check stool C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2
   - If continues to be hypotensive, bolus as necessary with
   crystalloid/pRBC. Patient may require additional CVL access as she only
   has a PICC with one usable port.
   - Will discuss with [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   # Anemia: Hematocrit up top 27.6 this AM.  Given recent history of
   abdominal surgery and bloody ostomy output, likely is due to bleeding.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 4u PRBC yesterday.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   # Post-op/anastomotic leak: As above. Currently hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Morphine prn.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Coagulopathy: Received 1u FFP prior to transfer to ICU for INR of

   to ATN from intra-operative hypotension.  Creatinine continues to rise
   to 4.4 with potassium to 5.8 this AM.
   - Trend creatinine
   - ECG to assess for hyperkalemic changes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Per renal, dose with IV lasix
   - Follow-up with renal regarding rising creatinine and potassium
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history significant for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post chemotherapy and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be low-grade B-cell lymphoma complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday, and her hematocrit increased to 27.6 this morning. She also received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to transfer to the ICU for an INR of 1.7. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure post-op likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from intra-operative hypotension. Her creatinine has risen to 4.4 with potassium to 5.8 this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has a significant fluid balance issue with a total in of 7,129 mL and total out of 195 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 6,934 mL. This can lead to fluid overload and further complications.
2. Abdominal Pain (including abdominal tenderness): The patient has a history of abdominal surgery, anastomotic leak, and intra-abdominal abscesses"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-cell lymphoma, and previous surgery for a right hemicolectomy due to anastomotic leak. She is currently in the ICU for various complications related to her condition. The patient's current issues include acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure from post-obstructive uropathy, an open abdominal wound, hyperkalemia, and shock from acute blood loss anemia.

The patient underwent surgery to evacuate a peritoneal hematoma and received blood, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma. Despite this, she continues to require norepinephrine (levophed) to maintain adequate blood pressure. Her urine output has not improved with Lasix or fluid resuscitation, and she has ongoing hyperkalemia, which has been treated with bicarbonate.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, increased creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging reveals continued right effusion and patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Problem: Cecal B-cell lymphoma s/p hemicolectomy, colostomy for anastomotic leak, now s/p peritoneal hematoma evacuation.
   - The patient's underlying condition remains a concern.
   - Continue monitoring and managing as per the previous plan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and B cell lymphoma who underwent chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy with colostomy for anastomotic leak. The patient also had an open abdominal wound due to peritoneal hematoma, which required evacuation. 

The patient presented with hypotension and was unresponsive to Lasix or fluid resuscitation. She also had persistent hyperkalemia and worsening hypotension, requiring the use of levophed. The patient underwent emergency surgery for hematoma evacuation and received blood products, including packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 52.0 K/uL, decreased hematocrit (Hct) of 19.4%, increased platelet count (Plt) of 116 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 4.8 mg/dL, decreased total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 20 mmHg, and elevated lactate acid level of 2.3 mmol/L. Imaging reveals continued right effusion and patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, open abdominal wound, hyperkalemia, and shock from acute blood loss anemia. 

The patient's current plan includes adjusting the pressor requirements to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg, continuing bicarb drip to manage hyperkalemia, and monitoring urine output. The patient will also continue to be intubated and sedated due to the open abdominal wound. 

Overall, the patient remains critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome."

 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   75 year old female with AML s/p chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for
   cecal mass found to be a low grade B cell lymphoma complicated by
   anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain
   placement and washout with surgical drain placement now readmitted to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening
   leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Improved today, but remains pressor dependent after
   hematoma evacuation.  Given markedly elevated WBC count and associated
   tachycardia + potential source for infection (abdomen), possibly a
   component of sepsis/SIRS, although less likely as hypotension improved
   with hemostasis. C. diff negative x2.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 350**] for now
   - Continue norepinephrine until OR
   - Transfuse 1 U prior to OR
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs [**2177-9-28**]. Good reason for blood loss anemia
   given large hematomas intraabdominally.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   - transfuse 1 U as above
   .
   # Post-op: Dressings changed by surgery.
   - will be taken back to OR for wound closure vs washout and re-pack.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**1-4**] to consumption with large abdominal
   hematoma.
   - recheck platelets this PM
   # Coagulopathy: may be [**1-4**] thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery, will
   aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to combination
   of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Likely will need FFP per surgery.
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine stable today. Potassium
   back to normal. Excellent diuresis this morning following removal of
   hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy today.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, f/u Bcr-Abl today
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.
   - Follow-up with Onc

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a right-sided hemicolectomy for a cecal mass found to be low-grade B cell lymphoma. She presented with hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis. The patient had a large intra-abdominal hematoma, which was evacuated and she remains intubated for surgery today. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 112/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg, and she is receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 0.03 mcg/kg/min. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,137 mL and output of 3,910 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -773 mL. Respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 30 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 26 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**1-4**] to consumption with large abdominal
   hematoma.
   - recheck platelets this PM
   # Coagulopathy: may be [**1-4**] thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery, will
   aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to combination
   of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Likely will need FFP per surgery.
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine stable today. Potassium
   back to normal. Excellent diuresis this morning following removal of
   hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a right-sided hemicolectomy for a cecal mass found to be low-grade B cell lymphoma. She presented with hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis, likely secondary to sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's labs indicate imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate levels. These imbalances can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte disturbances.
2. Abdominal pain and tenderness: The patient has abdominal pain and tenderness, which may be due to intra-abdominal abscesses or other postoperative complications. This could potentially lead to further infection or perforation of the abdominal organs.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which may be caused by hypotension, obstruction from hematoma, or other factors. This condition can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and decreased urine output.
4. Anemia and blood loss: The patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   75 year old female with AML s/p chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for
   cecal mass found to be a low grade B cell lymphoma complicated by
   anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain
   placement and washout with surgical drain placement now readmitted to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening
   leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Given large hematoma noted yesterday on CT, likely
   related to bleeding. Given markedly elevated WBC count and associated
   tachycardia + potential source for infection (abdomen), likely also a
   component of sepsis/SIRS. C. diff negative x1.
   - Continue vancomycin IV and flagyl IV for empiric coverage
   - Per ID recs, d/c Zosyn and begin meropenem given that patient has
   been persistently infected even with Zosyn on board
   - Daily vanc troughs (goal 15-20)
   - D/c vancomycin PO which was started yesterday given concern for C
   diff based on markedly elevated WBC count and no clear source of
   infection
   - Follow cultures, C diff toxin
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Recheck lactate; peaked at ~3.6 today
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs yesterday. Good reason for blood loss anemia
   given large hematomas intraabdominally.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   # Post-op: Dressings changed by surgery.
   - Keep patient intubated and sedated until Monday; at that time will be
   taken back to OR for wound closure.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Coagulopathy: Stable. Given recent surgery, will aim for lower INR.
   Given vitamin K yesterday. Likely due to combination of
   malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Repeat vitamin K this morning
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine continues to rise.
   Potassium elevated as well. Excellent diuresis this morning following
   removal of hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis. Given
   several rounds of calcium, bicarbonate, insulin + D50.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - ECG to assess for hyperkalemic changes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy either today or Monday.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, send Bcr-Abl today

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. She was previously readmitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis. The patient underwent anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses, and a surgical drain was placed. She also has a large hematoma noted on CT, likely related to bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to bleeding from the large hematoma and sepsis/SIRS. The source of infection is in the abdomen, which could lead to further complications.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely secondary to blood loss due to the large hematomas intra-abdominally. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) yesterday.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy possibly due to malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis. Vitamin K was administered yesterday, and the INR should be monitored.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure due to ATN from hypotension and obstruction secondary to hematoma. The creatinine level continues to rise, and potassium is elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for cecal mass (low-grade B-cell lymphoma). She is readmitted to the hospital for sepsis due to hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis. She underwent surgical closure and washout of her ventral wound. Her current vitals include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 116/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is intubated and sedated. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis due to multiple factors, including hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis. It is crucial to continue aggressive management of sepsis, including monitoring vital signs, maintaining fluid balance, administering appropriate antibiotics, and providing supportive care.

2. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. She has received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) previously, and it is planned to transfuse"

   I saw and examined the patient with the medical resident, reviewed 24
   hour events and was present for key portions of the services provided.
   Patient continues to be critically ill, ventilated for respiratory
   failure.  To OR yesterday where abdomen was unpacked and wound closed.
   A-line came out overnight. Overnight hct dropped to 21 without evidence
   of increased output from surgical drains.  Weaned off pressors at 5 am
   albeit given hemodynamic lability needed to go back on at 0945 just
   prior to our rounding.  Low grade fevers overnight. Lungs with
   scattered crackles albeit mostly dependent.  Tachy, regular. Abdomen
   distended, midline wound dressing clean and dry. Anasarca increased.
   Unresponsive even to noxious stimuli, have decreased fentanyl and
   versed as suspect she is oversedated.  Labs notable for WBC 72, plts
   100K, INR 1.7.  No new culture data.
   Problems:
   1)       Chronic respiratory failure secondary to volume overload.  Has
   had secretions, mostly described as frothy albeit today more thick,
   tan.  Bronchoscopy showed minimal frothy secretions throughout, BAL
   clear sent for gram stain, C+S as per surgery. Continues broad spectum
   abx/antifungal therapy. Need to readdress with ID service as to
   endpoint.  Try to diurese with blood transfusions today if blood
   pressure will tolerate.  Needs a-line replaced as this came out
   overnight.
   2)       Anemia:  No clear evidence of blood loss in abdomen given
   drains not producing much output.  Will give FFP to maintain INR <1.5.
   Plts up to 100K.  Follow serial CBC, if trending down will obtain
   repeat CT of the abdomen.
   3)       Hypotension secondary to hypovolemia vs. sepsis:  Managing
   with IVF challenge, transfuse pRBCs as above given hct drop, continues

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass diagnosed as low-grade B-cell lymphoma. She is readmitted to the ICU for sepsis, anastomotic leak, and intra-abdominal abscesses. The patient underwent a procedure for wound closure and washout, and her anterior drains had good output while her posterior drains had minimal drainage.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including chronic respiratory failure, anemia, hypotension, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. 

1. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to volume overload. Secretions are present, mostly frothy, but bronchoscopy showed minimal frothy secretions throughout, and BAL is clear. Broad-spectrum antibiotic and antifungal therapy is ongoing. The endpoint needs to be discussed with the ID service, and diuresis should be attempted with blood transfusions if blood pressure allows. An arterial line needs to be replaced as it came out overnight.

2. Anemia: There is no clear evidence of blood loss in the abdomen since the drains are not producing much output. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be given to maintain INR <1.5. Platelets should be transfused up to 100K. Serial CBC should be followed, and if trending down, a repeat CT of"

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoF with AML s/p chemo and R  hemicolectomy for cecal mass (low grade
   B cell lymphoma) c/b anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses s/p
   IR guided drain placement and washout with surgical drain now
   readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for sepsis (hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy,
   and worsening leukocytosis)
   # Hypotension: Improved today, but remains pressor dependent after
   hematoma evacuation.  Given markedly elevated WBC count and associated
   tachycardia + potential source for infection (abdomen), possibly a
   component of sepsis/SIRS, although less likely as hypotension improved
   with hemostasis. C. diff negative x2.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 350**] for now
   - Continue norepinephrine until OR
   - Transfuse 1 U prior to OR
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs [**2177-9-28**]. Good reason for blood loss anemia
   given large hematomas intraabdominally.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   - transfuse 1 U as above
   .
   # Post-op: Dressings changed by surgery.
   - will be taken back to OR for wound closure vs washout and re-pack.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**1-4**] to consumption with large abdominal
   hematoma.
   - recheck platelets this PM
   # Coagulopathy: may be [**1-4**] thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery, will
   aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to combination
   of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Likely will need FFP per surgery.
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine stable today. Potassium
   back to normal. Excellent diuresis this morning following removal of
   hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy today.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, f/u Bcr-Abl today
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for cecal mass (low-grade B cell lymphoma). The patient was readmitted to the ICU for sepsis (hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient remains pressor dependent after hematoma evacuation. There is a concern for sepsis/SIRS due to the markedly elevated WBC count, associated tachycardia, and potential source of infection (abdomen).

2. Anemia: The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**2177-9-28**]. Good reason for blood loss anemia given large hematomas intraabdominally. Serial hct should be trended and transfuse for hct <25.

3. Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to consumption with large abdominal hematoma. Recheck platelets this PM.

4. Coagulopathy: May be due to thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery, aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K on [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to combination of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for cecal mass (low-grade B cell lymphoma). She was readmitted to the ICU for sepsis, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis following the closure of her ventral wound. 

The patient underwent wound closure and washout, and her anterior drains had good output, while posterior drains had minimal inferior drainage. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and will require further transfusions. Platelet levels are low due to consumption in abdominal hematoma and dilutional secondary to blood transfusions. She was given vitamin K and will need further transfusions of platelets.

The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis, with an INR of 1.7. Two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) were given for this. Acute renal failure was initially suspected, but her urine output was good overnight, and creatinine levels have stabilized. Medications are being renally dosed, and nephrotoxins are being avoided.

Pathology of the cecal mass showed low-grade B cell lymphoma. The patient has a history of AML, which is currently being treated. There is concern for recurrence given leukocytosis, but"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and low-grade B-cell lymphoma. She underwent right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass but developed anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses. She was readmitted to the ICU for sepsis, now on the second day post-would closure and washout.

The patient's current medical conditions include shock, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, alteration in nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, abdominal pain, acute renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
- Heart rate: 81 bpm
- Blood pressure: 95/50 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96%

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 67.1 thousand cells/microliter, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 100 thousand cells/microliter, elevated creatinine at 4.1 mg/dL, and altered liver function tests.

The patient has been treated with multiple blood transfusions and is receiving various medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and anticoagul"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]):  Bronch yesterday showed
   minimal thin, frothy secretions.  Sputum gram stains with more than 25
   polys, no organisms.  BAL pending. Still with total body fluid
   overload, will need to remove fluid to start to move her towards
   weaning from ventilator support.  Now off pressors for more than 12
   hours.  Will hold on lasix drip until sure hct stable as below.
 HYPOTENSION:  In setting of hct drop was concerned about active
   bleeding albeit not clear this was the case as below.  On broad
   spectrum abx/ antifungals.  Repeat blood cultures sent through line
   given possibility of sepsis.
 ANEMIA:  No increased output from abdominal drains noted.   Right
   drain out.  Dressing clean and dry.  Abdomen a bit more distended
   today.  Hct bumped appropriately to transfusion.  Will follow today for
   evidence of blood loss.  Low threshold to repeat abdominal scan if hct
   decreases over the day.
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER: Hypokalemia, repleted this
   morning.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Creatinine
   continues to improve albeit may see worsening in setting of transient
   hypotension albeit given transfusions and volume resusuitation,
   hopefully will avoid further insult.
 COAGULOPATHY:  Received vitamin K and FFP yesterday.  INR still
   elevated.  Will hold on further FFP as no evidence of active bleeding.
   Else agree with assessment and plan as per the medical resisdent's
   note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, acute hypotension, anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute renal failure, and coagulopathy. The patient underwent an abdominal unpacking procedure and closure of an abdominal wound. They are currently on mechanical ventilation support and have been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals due to concerns of sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, requiring mechanical ventilation. The presence of minimal thin, frothy secretions in the bronchoscopic examination suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema or ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation parameters and daily lung ultrasound to assess for worsening pulmonary edema or development of ARDS is crucial.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct) and blood pressure. This could be indicative of ongoing bleeding or sepsis. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and frequent hct measurements are necessary. Repeat blood cultures through the arterial line should be sent due to the possibility of sepsis.

3. Anemia: The patient has shown signs of anemia, possibly due to internal bleeding or blood loss during the abdominal procedure. Frequent monitoring of hct levels and observation for any signs of bleeding are essential. Repeat abdominal scans may be needed if there is evidence of ongoing blood loss.

4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for cecal mass complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is currently in the ICU on day 3 post wound closure and washout. The patient remains off pressors, afebrile, and with stable WBC count. Her heart rate is in the 80s.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of sepsis due to intra-abdominal infection and previous septic episode. Monitoring of vital signs, fever curve, and NGTD cultures is necessary.
2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is weaned to 40% FiO2 and remains on AC. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status is required.
3. Fluid Balance: The patient has a net negative fluid balance overnight. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output, along with CXR and ABG, is necessary to manage fluid status.
4. Increased Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has slightly increased AP and TB levels. Trending of LFTs and holding Caspofungin is recommended.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable overnight. Serial hct monitoring and transfusion for Hct <25 are advised.

   both consumption in abdominal hematoma and dilutional secondary to
   blood transfusions.
   - Serial Platlets checks and transfusion
   # Coagulopathy: INR may be [**1-4**] thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery,
   will aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to
   combination of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Consider 2 units of FFP this AM for INR of 1.7.
   # Acute renal failure: Good UOP overnight. Differential etiologies were
   ATN from hypotension + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and low-grade B-cell lymphoma, who underwent right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass. She was readmitted to the ICU for sepsis, characterized by hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving TPN with lipids, and has multiple IV lines including a PICC line, multi-lumen line, and arterial line. She is also on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and thrombocytopenia. Her INR is elevated, and she has acute renal failure with improved urine output overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. It is important to continue aggressive management with antibiotics, fluids, and monitoring of vital signs.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. Further transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) may be necessary to maintain an adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusions"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for cecal mass complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is currently on day 3 post wound closure and washout.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is off pressors, afebrile, and has a stable white blood cell count. Cultures for next-generation sequencing (NGTD) are pending. The plan is to continue with Flagyl and recheck vancomycin levels tomorrow for potential redosing. Caspofungin is being held, and minimal drainage is observed from the Jackson-Pratt (JP) drains.

2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been weaned to 40% FiO2 overnight and remains on assisted control (AC) ventilation. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) remains above 105, indicating potential transition to pressure support (PS) ventilation.

3. Fluid Balance: The patient has a net negative fluid balance overnight, just short of the goal of -1L. Plateaus have slightly increased from 25 to 27. The plan is to continue the Lasix drip to improve compliance, check the chest X-ray for any"

The patient has several medical complications that need attention:

1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's PS has been decreased to 10/5 overnight, and her ABG shows an increased PaCO2 level. Surgery wants to increase PS to 12 due to the patient's increased CO2 levels. It is recommended to continue diuresis with a negative goal of 1.5 L, recheck gas exchange, and discuss with both the medicine and surgery teams.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass. She is currently in the ICU on POD#4 from wound closure and washout. She has an anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis that is now resolving. The patient's current issues include sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, fluid balance, increased liver function tests (LFTs), anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, AML recurrence, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is currently resolving but can quickly deteriorate if not closely monitored. There is a risk of recurrent sepsis due to the ongoing intra-abdominal infection.
2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored due to the risk of worsening hypoxemia and the need for potential adjustments in ventilator settings.
3. Fluid Balance: The patient's negative fluid balance indicates ongoing fluid losses. Close monitoring is necessary to avoid dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Increased LFTs: The patient's LFTs are slightly increased, indicating potential liver injury. Further investigation and monitoring are warranted to identify the cause and prevent further liver damage.
5. Anemia: The patient's H"

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 80s, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate at 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 47.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, platelet count of 87 K/uL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, and liver enzymes showing mild elevation. The patient's electrolytes are being aggressively repleted.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient remains off pressors, afebrile, and with a stable WBC count. Cultures for the next-generation urinary catheter tip have been obtained.
2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been weaned off high-flow oxygen and remains on assist control ventilation. Discussion with the team is ongoing regarding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass. She developed an anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis, which has since resolved. The patient is currently on post-operative day (POD) 6 after wound closure and washout.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis remains off pressors, as she is afebrile and her WBC count is stable. Cultures from the NG tube drain are pending. It is recommended to continue monitoring the WBC count and fever curve.

2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced PS 9-12 overnight. It is advised to continue diuresis with 1.5 negative goal and recheck gas exchange. Discussion with both the medicine and surgery teams is needed.

3. Fluid Balance: The patient has a negative fluid balance of 3.8L overnight. To improve compliance, continue Lasix drip. Check ABG for acid-base status while diuresing and aggressively replete electrolytes.

4. Increased Liver Function Tests (LFTs): Although the transaminases are improving, there is a slight increase in alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. It is recommended to hold Caspofungin and discuss further investigation with the team. Trend LFTs regularly.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for cecal mass complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The patient's recent events include reordering TPN with Vit K, unsuccessful attempt at placing a radial arterial line, femoral arterial line in place, no Lasix since evening of 10-3 but continuing to diuresis approximately 2L in 24 hours, elevated amylase/lipase levels, and the need for a vaginal exam for possible vaginal bleeding.

The patient's allergies include Lisinopril with hives and Aspirin with dyspepsia. She received antibiotics including Metronidazole, Vancomycin, and Meropenem.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/77 mmHg to 187/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her weight is currently 93.6 kg and height is 61 inches.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 35.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, glucose level of 126 mg/dL, sodium"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with an anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is now on postoperative day (POD) 6 from wound closure and washout.

The patient remains off pressors, afebrile, and with a stable white blood cell (WBC) count. Her heart rate is in the 80s, and cultures from the nasogastric tube drains have been sent.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, with partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 263. She is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 96.

The patient has ongoing fluid balance issues, with a net even fluid status overnight. Her electrolytes are being repleted as needed.

Liver function tests (LFTs) are continuing to improve, but the patient still has an elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 1.8, which has not changed despite Vitamin K administration. Serial hct and platelet transfusions are planned.

Acute renal failure is improving, with a decreasing creatinine level from 3"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass, which resulted in an anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. The patient is currently on postoperative day 6 after undergoing wound closure and washout. The patient remains off pressors, afebrile, and with stable WBC count. Cultures from the NG tube drain have been obtained.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including shock, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, alteration in nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, abdominal pain, renal failure, and sepsis. These conditions are being managed through various interventions such as weaning off sedation, discussing with the surgical team regarding I/O goals, checking ABG for acid-base status, repleting electrolytes aggressively, monitoring UOP, renal dosing of medications, avoiding nephrotoxins, and following up with oncology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and there is a concern for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The plan is to wean the PS level and discuss with the surgical team for extubation goals.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of UOP, renal dos"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass and subsequently developed anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient had resolving sepsis but still shows signs of infection, such as fever and elevated white blood cell count. Monitoring of vital signs, cultures, and WBC count is important to prevent further progression of sepsis.

2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 303, indicating respiratory failure. The respiratory support provided through CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 40% is appropriate. The plan is to repeat RSBI (respiratory system compliance and resistance index) this afternoon and consider extubation if improved.

3. Fluid Balance: The patient has had negative fluid balance over the past day, with a total outflow exceeding inflow. This may be due to ongoing losses from drains or surgery. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to maintain appropriate fluid balance.

4. Increased Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's AST and ALT levels are elevated. This may be due to a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for cecal mass complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscess. The patient is currently in the ICU on POD#6 from wound closure and washout.

The patient remains off pressors and is afebrile. The white blood cell count is stable, and the heart rate is in the 80s. Cultures from the nasogastric tube drains have been sent.

The patient's respiratory status remains concerning for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 189/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, PaO2 of 303 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's fluid balance is even overnight, and electrolytes are being replenished as needed. The labs show improvement in liver function tests, coagulopathy, renal function, and other parameters.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right hemicolectomy and hematoma evacuation. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing leukocytosis, hypotension, and other complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's hypotension indicates a possible shock condition. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation are necessary.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's distended abdomen and the presence of drains suggest the possibility of impaired skin integrity. Regular assessments for signs of pressure ulcers or wound infections are needed.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute: Although the patient was successfully extubated and is currently on nasal cannula with good oxygen saturation, ongoing monitoring is essential to prevent further respiratory compromise.
4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to being NPO. Regular assessment of nutritional status and possible transition to enteral feeding should be considered.
5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has a significant fluid loss of -5L overnight and is autodiuresing. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is required, along with repletion as needed.
6. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal distension and presence of drains may indicate abdominal pain. Pain assessment and management are necessary.
7. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a right hemicolectomy for cecal mass. She is currently in the ICU on day 10 post-operation due to complications including anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 132/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and is being managed with TPN and enteral nutrition. The patient's lab results show resolving sepsis, improving white blood cell count, stable hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of resolving sepsis, but close monitoring is necessary due to her immunocompromised state and recent surgical procedures.
2. Intra-abdominal Hematoma: The patient's hematocrit levels are stable, indicating no significant bleeding at this time. However, continuous monitoring for any signs of worsening hematoma or abdominal complications is crucial.
3. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains extubated and maintaining good oxygen saturation. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and oxygen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right hemicolectomy for cecal mass complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. The patient is currently in the ICU on POD #10 post-wound closure and washout. The patient has resolved sepsis, stable intra-abdominal hematoma, and remains extubated with good oxygen saturation on 3L nasal cannula.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has resolved sepsis but requires continued monitoring of the fever curve.
2. Intra-abdominal Hematoma: The patient's hematocrit levels are stable, indicating no current intervention is required.
3. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains extubated and maintains good oxygen saturation on 3L NC. Continued monitoring is recommended.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient had a negative fluid balance yesterday and overnight, with a goal of -2L today as per surgery recommendations. Electrolytes should be replenished as needed.
5. Increased Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's AP and TB levels appeared to peak on 10-4. This may be due to a lag effect from a prior hypotensive episode causing ""shock liver."" No current interventions are needed, and LFTs should continue to be trended.

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass. She developed anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma, which led to resolving sepsis on postoperative day (POD) #10 following wound closure and washout.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate 80 bpm, blood pressure 132/55 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
- Review of systems: Unchanged from admission except for the noted below.
- Physical examination: Overweight/obese, PERRL, normocephalic, cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes within normal limits, cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, diminished right and left distal pulses, crackles in the dependently positioned lung fields, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, extremities with 1+ edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and attentive with follow-up commands.
- Labs: WBC count decreasing from 24.5 to 22.7 thousand/mm³, Hct levels decreasing from 33.3% to 34.4%, platelet count stable at around 68 thousand/mm³, creatinine improving from 2.1 to 1.9 mg/dL, and other lab results within normal limits.
- Imaging: Not provided.
- Assessment and plan: The patient remains off pressors, WBC improving, cultures negative, and sepsis resolving. She is extubated and maintaining good oxygen saturation on 3 liters nasal cannula. Fluid balance is negative 2 liters since yesterday, lasix drip remains off, and negative 1 liter overnight. Electrolytes are being repleted as needed. Increased liver enzymes are observed, but no current interventions are planned. Thrombocytopenia is stable, and no signs of further worsening of hematoma are seen. INR is improving from 1.7 to 1.6. Acute renal failure is improving, with good urine output yesterday. Medications are being renally dosed, avoiding nephrotoxins, and renal recommendations are being followed. AML and cecal mass follow-up with hematology/oncology. Diabetes mellitus type 2 is well-controlled with fasting blood sugars in the 100's. ICU care includes total parenteral nutrition with lipids, fiber supplementation, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and patient code status set to full code."

The patient had a femoral arterial line that was discontinued, and he was seen by the physical therapy department. The patient also had a speech and swallow evaluation that failed, with plans to re-evaluate in a few days. A Dobhoff tube was placed in good position, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids was started per surgical recommendations. A nutrition consult was ordered but not completed. The patient is also dependent on heparin for anticoagulation.

The patient has allergies to lisinopril and aspirin, and the last dose of antibiotics was administered.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 80 bpm (normal range 72-88 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 132/55mmHg to 147/63mmHg (normal range 74-137/20-83mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (normal range 15-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for cecal mass complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. She is currently in the ICU on POD #11 from wound closure and washout. The patient's current issues include resolving sepsis, intra-abdominal hematoma, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, fluid balance, increased liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, AML recurrence, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and has been extubated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's resolving sepsis is a potential complication that can arise due to the ongoing infection and inflammatory response in the body.
2. Intra-abdominal Hematoma: The presence of an intra-abdominal hematoma can lead to complications such as ongoing bleeding, organ damage, or perforation.
3. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: This condition can worsen and result in inadequate oxygenation of tissues, potentially leading to multiorgan dysfunction.
4. Fluid Balance: Imbalances in fluid volume can affect organ function and lead to complications like pulmonary edema or hypotension.
5. Increased LFTs: Elevated liver enzymes can indicate liver injury"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass that resulted in an anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma.
- The patient is now on postoperative day (POD) #12 and has resolved sepsis following wound closure and washout.
- Current issues include sepsis, intra-abdominal hematoma, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, fluid balance, increased liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2.
- Sepsis: The patient is afebrile and off pressors, with a stable white blood cell (WBC) count. Cultures from the nasogastric tube drain have been obtained.
- Intra-abdominal Hematoma: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and no current intervention is needed.
- Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains extubated and has good oxygen saturation on room air. Monitoring will continue.
- Fluid Balance: The patient had a negative fluid balance yesterday, and lasix infusion has been discontinued. The patient is being repleted with electrolytes as needed, and free water repletion is also"

- She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including fever of unknown origin, chronic pancreatitis, impaired physical mobility, shock, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, altered nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, abdominal pain, renal failure, and potential liver issues.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, amylase, lipase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
- She has positive EBV and CMV IgG antibodies but negative EBV IgM.
- The patient has a high ferritin level, which needs to be remeasured after dilution.
- She also has decreased bicarbonate levels, stable hematocrit, and stable platelet count.
- The patient's current medications include TPN with lipids, PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and antibiotics.

The patient is currently in the ICU for wound closure and washout, now on postoperative day (POD) #13.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had a persistent fever despite being off antibiotics since October 3rd. Cultures from the nasogastric tube drainage have been sent.
2. Chronic pancreatitis: The patient's amylase and lipase levels are elevated, indicating ongoing inflammation of the pancreas.
3. Impaired physical mobility: The patient is likely bedridden due to her recent surgery and medical conditions.
4. Other shock: The patient had resolving sepsis but remains at risk for further episodes of shock.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may have pressure ulcers or other skin breakdowns due to prolonged immobility.
6. Acute respiratory failure: The patient required intubation but is now extubated and maintaining good oxygen saturation on room air.
7. Alteration in nutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids due to her inability to take oral intake.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for cecal mass complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including sepsis, intra-abdominal hematoma, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, fluid balance disorder, increased liver function tests, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and potential recurrence of AML.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which can lead to further systemic infection and organ dysfunction.
2. Intra-abdominal Hematoma: The patient has a stable intra-abdominal hematoma, but there is a risk of rebleeding or expansion, potentially leading to organ compression or failure.
3. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for worsening respiratory failure, which can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Fluid Balance Disorder: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, increasing the risk of electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
5. Increased Liver Function Tests: Elevated liver enzymes indicate possible liver injury or dysfunction, which can progress to hepatic failure.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the"

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoF with AML s/p chemo and R  hemicolectomy for cecal mass c/b
   anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma here with resolving
   sepsis now POD #13 from wound closure and wash out.
   # Increased LFTs: TB slightly down to 7.1, peak was 8.1 on [**10-5**].
   Fractionation showed elevated Direct bili. Transaminases stable. Liver
   consulted yesterday think it is unlikely shock liver but could have
   been an effect of caspo with contribution to elevated T bili from
   resolving hematomas.  EBV and CMV IgG  positive. EBV IgM negative.
   Hepatitis Panel unrevealing for active disease.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be stone
   although imaging has shown no ductal dilation.
   - Ferritin too high to measure -> will call lab to dilute sample to
   remeasure and have a number
   - ? hemachromatosis or Still
s disease
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - Liver following
   - Cont to trend LFTs, lipase and amylase
   .
   # Decreased bicarb.:   Down now from 18 to 15.  Previously had a
   respiratory alkalosis for unclear reasons.  Now may be compensatory
   acidosis or primary acidosis.  Will need more info
   - ABG today
   - Urine lytes
   - ostomy output lytes
   # Fluid Balance: -1L yesterday, lasix gtt remains off.
   -          I=O today
   -          Repleting electrolytes PRN
   -          PM lytes
   # Sepsis: Afebrile. Remains off  pressors. WBC stable at 22 today.
   Cultures NGTD.
   -  Following WBC count, fever curve
   -  Off antibiotics since [**2177-10-3**]
   -  JP drains out. Ostomy draining well..
   .
   # Intra-abdominal Hematoma. Hct stable.
   - Stable, no current intervention.
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Pt remains extubated good O2 Sat
   on RA.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable for last several days.  No signs of further
   worsening of hematoma.
   - continue to monitor
   # Coagulopathy: Stable at 1.5 yesterday
   - Trending INR
   # Acute renal failure: Good UOP yestedary. Creatinine yest stable at
   1.6
   - Monitor UOP- will try to keep I=O today
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # AML and Cecal Mass: Followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.
   - Follow-up with Onc
   .
   # DM 2:  FS in mid 100's, well controlled
   - ISS and accuchecks.

   Problems
   Complicated bowel anatomy (see operations above)
   Low bicarbonate
          This was previously dominantly a respiratory alkalosis, but
   HCO3 has continued to fall.
          Check ABG, ULytes, ostomy lytes and then evaluate further
          TPN is low-chloride already
   Liver disease
          Appears mostly cholestatic.  However, holding TPN is a major
   issue in this patient.
          Appreciate hepatology
s input
   Ferritin > Assay
          Ask lab to dilute
          Discuss with hepatology: does she have hemochromatosis?
   Could this help explain her pancreatitis?
   Acute renal failure
          Continues to improve
   AML and cecal mass

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for cecal mass. She is currently in the ICU on POD #14 following wound closure and washout. The patient has several ongoing medical issues including pancreatitis, increased liver function tests (LFTs), non-gap metabolic acidosis, fluid balance, intra-abdominal hematoma, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is stable overall, with ongoing monitoring and management of these various issues. Surgery and hepatology input are being sought for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest ongoing pancreatitis. If not appropriately managed, it could lead to complications such as necrosis, infection, or systemic inflammation.
2. Increased LFTs: The elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver injury or dysfunction. Continued hepatotoxicity could worsen the patient's condition and potentially lead to liver failure.
3. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: This condition requires prompt investigation and treatment. It could be due to diarrhea or renal tubular acidosis (RTA). If left untreated, it may result in severe acid-base imbalance and organ dysfunction.
4. Fluid balance: Close monitoring of the patient's fluid intake and output is essential to maintain electrolyte balance"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis, impaired physical mobility, and altered nutrition. Currently, the patient is experiencing delirium, fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, shock, impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, abdominal pain, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is displaying signs of confusion and delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, medications, or organ dysfunction. It is essential to address the underlying cause and provide appropriate management to improve the patient's mental status.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has an elevated body temperature, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory process. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate treatment.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory system is not functioning adequately, possibly due to complications from pancreatitis or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring and intervention, including mechanical ventilation if necessary, may be required to support the patient's breathing.

4. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, which can be a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to vital organs. Immediate assessment and stabilization of the patient's hemodynamic status are crucial.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has compromised skin integrity, which increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers or infections. Proper skin care"
