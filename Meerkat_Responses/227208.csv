   transferred to MICU for increasing O2 requirements and tachypnea,
   concern for PE vs. HAP.
   # hypoxia/tachypnea
 BL 4l since extubation, then 5L.  Leading ddx of
   tachypnea thought splinting [**1-18**] ascites, VAP, less likely PE now with
   negative LENIs.  Underwent therapeutic paracentesis [**11-8**] with
   improvement in tachypnea from 35 to 25, O2 requirement from face
   mask/NRB to 5L.  For pna, added meropenem for broader coverage with
   vanco on [**11-8**], sputum gram stain showed gram positive cocci, so likely
   staph or strep, but aspirated sputum may be false negative for GN
   microbes.  PE less likely with negative LE LENIs and other leading
   diagnoses.
   - cont vanco plan to complete 10d course, ending on [**11-3**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and sustained a dens fracture at T8 and hemoperitoneum. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues.

1. Tachypnea: The patient presented with increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The leading differential diagnosis for tachypnea includes splinting due to ascites, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and pulmonary embolism (PE). However, PE is less likely since the lower extremity venous ultrasound (LE LENIs) was negative. The patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis, which improved his tachypnea and oxygen requirements.

2. Altered mental status/cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy. His mental status has fluctuated, and he exhibits moaning and purposeful movements. The altered mental status could be multifactorial, including medication effects, infection, or uremia. The plan includes holding sedating medications, lactulose, rifaximin, and titrating to bowel movements.

3. Liver laceration: The patient had a liver laceration secondary to the MVA, which was managed medically with blood products and cryoprecipitate. Bladder pressures were monitored before and after therapeutic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is tachypnea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and underwent several interventions and assessments. 

Some notable events include changing the patient's respiratory support to nonrebreather (NRB) and performing arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, which showed a pH level of 7.43, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 169. The patient also underwent a lower extremity venous ultrasound (LE LENIs) to assess for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) risk, but no DVT was found. However, superficial thrombophlebitis was noted in the right calf region. 

The patient continued on lactulose and experienced increased bowel movements with brown stool. The antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, meropenem, and stopped spore prophylaxis. An abdominal paracentesis was performed, removing 5 liters of bloody fluid, which was sent for cell counts, culture, and cytology. Intravenous albumin was administered post-procedure. 

The patient's bladder pressure decreased from 17 to 12 mmHg pre- and post-procedure, respectively. Hematocrit (HCT) recheck showed a slight decrease from 27 to 26.8, then increased to 28.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and developed hemoperitoneum, which was managed medically. He then presented with increasing oxygen requirements, tachypnea, and concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) versus hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient underwent paracentesis due to abdominal distention and has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, portal gastropathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and esophageal varices. He also had a TIPS procedure performed. The patient's current condition includes confusion, hypoxia, respiratory distress, altered mental status, cirrhosis, liver laceration, T8 fracture, acute renal failure (ARF), hypernatremia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's tachypnea and hypoxia, there is a risk of further respiratory distress or failure, especially with the presence of altered mental status which may compromise respiratory drive.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy and cirrhosis increases the risk of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and previous transfer from another hospital for management of multiple medical conditions including liver cirrhosis, TIPS and tips thrombosis, MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hemoperitoneum. The patient was admitted to the MICU for increasing oxygen requirements, tachypnea, and altered mental status.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line and paracentesis, which resulted in removal of 5 liters of bloody fluid. The patient also underwent an ultrasound and sputum culture. The patient has been on various medications including vancomycin, linezolid, meropenem, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 143/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is 97.5 kg, and height is 68 inches. The patient's bladder pressure is 13 mmHg, and total fluid input/output balance is negative 3,757 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the lung bases, mild clonus, right knee with erythema, and distended abdomen. Neurologic examination shows normal tone and purposeful movements.

   54yoM ETOH cirrhosis, DM, hypothyroidism, tranferred f/OSH [**10-27**]
   post-MVA, c/b dens fx-T8 fx, and hemoperitoneum treated medically, now
   transferred to MICU for increasing O2 requirements and tachypnea.
   > hypoxia - on floor, baseline O2 4l, then on AM of transfer [**11-8**], had
   increasing RR to 30s, O2 requirement of 5L, pO2 70s.
   Concern for HAP/?VAP, vs. PE vs. atelectasis [**1-18**] abd distention.
   Intubation on [**10-27**], extubation [**11-3**], vancomycin start [**11-2**] for MRSA
   on sputum cx.  WBC with rise since [**11-3**], w/o radiographic e/o
   worsening infltrte.  No report of fevers on floor.  Changed to
   meropenem and linezolid on [**11-8**] by floor team for concern for
   untreated HAP.  Has been on heparin sq (order written on [**10-31**]), so
   unless underlying hypercoaguable state, PE less likely.   Abd
   distention significant with markedly low lung volumes, repeat abg on
   transfer to MICU suggests adequate oxygenation, with stable to ?trend
   toward slowing ventilation, as pCo2 with mild rise.  Abd paracentesis
   from mechanical standpoint would be beneficial, but question
   contraindication given hemoperitoneum.
   - sputum cx, may merit bronchoscopy with cultures if worsening cxr
   - DC linezolid, restart vanco, cont meropenem for broad coverage, MRSA
   - therapeutic paracentesis with iv albumin

   - check abd pressure via bladder pressure to assess for compartment
   syndrome
   - given contraindication to systemic anticoagulation given significant
   hemoperitoneum, will assess for LE DVT with bil LENIs, with
   consideration for IVC filter
   >altered mental status/cirrhosis - +etoh cirrhosis with hepatic

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient has multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, portal gastropathy, ascites, SBP, G1 esophageal varices, and G2 internal hemorrhoids.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, confusion, worsening liver function, renal failure, compartment syndrome, hypernatremia, and potential infections such as hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile, low albumin levels, and altered electrolyte balance. Imaging studies reveal liver laceration, T8 fracture, and possible thrombosis in the portal vein.

The plan of care includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, therapeutic paracentesis with albumin administration, assessment for deep vein thrombosis, consideration of inferior vena cava filter placement, monitoring for alternative causes of altered mental status, and management of hepatic encephalopathy. Other interventions include holding diuretics, discontinuing sedating medications, and providing supportive care.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple organ dysfunction, potential infections, and complications related to his underlying medical conditions."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and previous transfer from another hospital for multiple medical issues. The patient was admitted to the MICU for increasing oxygen requirements, tachypnea, and altered mental status. He is known to have cirrhosis and has undergone a TIPS procedure with subsequent thrombosis. The patient's chief complaints include hypoxia and tachypnea, which were initially thought to be related to hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or atelectasis. However, a large-volume paracentesis was performed and resulted in improvement.

Assessment and Plan:
1. DC linezolid, restart vancomycin (10-day course), continue meropenem for broad coverage.
2. Repeat therapeutic paracentesis on [11-10].
3. Follow abdominal pressure via bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome.
4. Keep head of bed (HOB) > 45 degrees to prevent aspiration.
5. Hold lactulose, as the patient has social issues preventing its administration.
6. Restart lactulose and control agitation. There may also be a component of renal failure as well as hypernatremia.
7. Hold po bactrim since [Last Name] and vancomycin, consider restart after antibiotic duration.
8. Hold lasix/diuretics due to acute renal failure (ARF).
9. Hold sedating medications.
10. Administer lactulose, rifaximin, titrate to [2-18] bowel movements per day, Lactulose enema x1 today.
11. Continue ursodiol.
12. Follow-up cultures.
13. Hold opiates.
14. Trend hct.
15. Active t/s.
16. Conservative management for T8 fracture.
17. Non-weight bearing (NWB) for T8 fracture, HOB 45 degrees.
18. Hold diuretics.
19. UA, urine lytes, trend pre and post albumin challenge.
20. Check abdominal pressure via bladder pressure for compartment syndrome.
21. Increase free water with D5 after calculating his free water deficit.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient has a history of increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea, which could be due to various causes such as hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or atelectasis. Monitoring oxygen saturation and providing supplemental oxygen as needed is crucial to prevent hypoxemia.
2. Tension pneumothorax: Given the patient's altered mental status and the presence of crackles at the bases, it is important to monitor for signs of tension pneumothorax, such as decreased breath sounds, tracheal deviation, and hypotension. Immediate decompression may be required if suspected.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the floor for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea with altered mental status. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including hypoxemia, possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), abdominal distention, liver laceration, altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, liver laceration from a motor vehicle accident, and fractures in the dorsal spine.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient has been improving with a large volume paracentesis. He will likely need a repeat paracentesis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and the patient's oxygen requirements should be closely monitored.
2. Altered mental status/cirrhosis: The patient may have hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose and agitation control should be considered, along with monitoring for hypernatremia.
3. Liver laceration: The patient received blood transfusions and has stable hemoglobin levels. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin trends is recommended.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and diuretics should be held. Renal function should be followed, and a renal consult may be necessary.

   overload given the albumin and free water he required.  Since we can
   not safely diurese today need to optimize pulm mechanics, up in bed,
   ideally in a chair.
   - DC linezolid, restart vanco (10 day course [**11-3**] day 1), change to

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 35 minutes; patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, DM, hypothyroidism, and previous medical issues. He was admitted to the MICU for increasing O2 requirements, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The patient's main concerns include hypoxemia, encephalopathy, liver laceration, dens/T8 fractures, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing and low oxygen levels. This can lead to further respiratory distress and may require mechanical ventilation support.

2. Encephalopathy: The patient has signs of hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis. If not properly managed, this can progress to severe confusion, coma, or other neurological complications.

3. Liver laceration: The patient has a history of liver laceration from a motor vehicle accident. If there is bleeding or rebleeding, it can result in hemorrhagic shock and require emergency surgical intervention.

4. Dens/T8 fractures: The patient has fractures at the dens and T8 vertebrae. Prolonged immobilization and improper management can increase the risk of pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pneumonia.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte im"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The patient has a known diagnosis of cirrhosis with portal hypertension, which led to a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. He also has a history of thrombosis in the TIPS, multiple rib fractures, and a motor vehicle accident resulting in a dens fracture at T8 and hemoperitoneum treated medically. The patient is currently intubated and extubated on day 18. His current symptoms include hypoxemia, tachypnea, and abdominal distention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues. This can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring and appropriate interventions like oxygen supplementation or mechanical ventilation may be required.

2. Tachypnea: The patient's rapid breathing rate suggests respiratory distress or inadequate gas exchange. This can be due to lung infection, pulmonary embolism, or other causes. Treatment options may include antibiotics, diuretics, or bronchodilators depending on the underlying cause.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion or disorientation could be due to hepatic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is having difficulty breathing and requires respiratory support. This indicates a potential respiratory failure, which may be due to pneumonia, a hospital-acquired infection.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the consultation for renal failure. This could be multifactorial, potentially due to factors such as dehydration, medications, and underlying medical conditions.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in their electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and magnesium) and fluid status, as evidenced by the fluid balance sheet and laboratory results.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have fluctuated, suggesting possible anemia, which could be secondary to blood loss or other underlying causes.

5. Coagulopathy: The elevated PT/INR and low fibrinogen levels suggest a possible coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding.

6. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are slightly elevated, and there are concerns about hepatic encephalopathy. This indicates potential liver dysfunction.

7. Trauma: The patient has sustained multiple fractures (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral), indicating trauma.

8. Pneumonia: The patient is diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, which requires"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea, with a possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism or hospital-acquired pneumonia. He underwent therapeutic paracentesis with improvement in tachypnea and oxygenation. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure possibly multifactorial, liver laceration from a motor vehicle accident, and fractures of the dens and T8 vertebrae. He also has hypernatremia and hypokalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status/cirrhosis: The patient's chronic liver disease may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, causing confusion, disorientation, and changes in behavior.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function, which could be due to various factors such as hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic medications, or hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Liver laceration: The patient's history of motor vehicle accident resulted in a liver laceration, which can lead to internal bleeding and potential complications like hypovolemic shock.
4. Fractures of the dens and T8 vertebrae: The patient has spinal fractures that may cause neurological deficits or respiratory complications if there is spinal cord compression or damage"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea secondary to abdominal ascites. The patient also has a recent history of motor vehicle accident (MVA), resulting in a dens fracture at T8 and hemoperitoneum treated medically.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient required an increased amount of oxygen, up to 5 liters nasal cannula, due to increasing abdominal ascites. There was significant improvement in respiratory status after a large volume paracentesis.
- Altered mental status/Cirrhosis: The patient's mental status improved with holding opioids, lactulose, antibiotics for pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), large volume paracentesis, and improvement of renal function.
- SBP: Ascitic fluid consistent with SBP, though difficult to interpret in the setting of hemoperitoneum (s/p MVA). The patient was started on ciprofloxacin to treat SBP, with the first day of coverage on November 8th.
- Liver laceration: The patient had a liver laceration from the MVA, which was managed medically with 16 units packed red blood cells, 8 units fresh frozen plasma, 2 units platelets, 2 units cryop"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea secondary to increasing abdominal ascites. The patient also has cirrhosis and was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by MRSA in the sputum when intubated. He underwent a large volume paracentesis to remove 11 liters of ascitic fluid, which significantly improved his respiratory status. The patient's mental status improved with holding opioids, lactulose, antibiotics for pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and improvement of renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable due to increasing abdominal ascites, which can lead to further hypoxia and tachypnea.
2. Infection: The patient had VAP caused by MRSA and is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin for SBP. There is a risk of developing new infections due to his immunocompromised state.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with an elevated creatinine level of 2.7. It is important to monitor renal function and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
4. Liver Laceration: The patient had a liver laceration from a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and received blood transfusions and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and presented with respiratory difficulty due to increased abdominal ascites. The patient had been intubated and received mechanical ventilation. He was transferred to the MICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. A large volume paracentesis was performed to remove 11 liters of ascitic fluid, which led to significant improvement in respiratory status.

The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He is receiving vancomycin and meropenem, but the latter was discontinued as there was no evidence of Gram-negative rod infection. The patient also has cirrhosis and is showing signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), for which he is being treated with ciprofloxacin.

The patient's mental status is improving with the use of lactulose, antibiotics for pneumonia and SBP, large volume paracentesis, and improvement in renal function. His renal function has been fluctuating, and he is suspected to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and pre-renal state. He is being managed with albumin and free water.

The patient also sustained liver laceration and multiple vertebral fractures (dens/T8"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea secondary to abdominal ascites. The patient also has cirrhosis and is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by MRSA in the sputum. His mental status has improved with the removal of opioids, lactulose, antibiotics for pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and large volume paracentesis. The patient's renal function has also improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to increasing abdominal ascites, which can lead to hypoxia and tachypnea. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory rate is necessary. The patient may require ongoing support with supplemental oxygen.

2. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for VAP and SBP. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection, such as increased fever, leukocytosis, or worsening gas exchange. Regular cultures should be obtained to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.2, which has increased to 2.7. The renal failure could be multifactorial, including hypotension, pre-renal state, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitoring of renal function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and previous liver cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and increasing oxygen requirements. The patient has multiple comorbidities including MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), liver laceration from a motor vehicle accident (MVA), dens/T8 fractures, and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement suggests possible hypoxemia. This could be due to volume overload as indicated by his large volume ascites and previous administration of albumin and free water. Optimizing pulmonary mechanics by elevating the head of bed and using non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may help improve oxygenation.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcoholism and liver cirrhosis increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose therapy should be continued to manage this condition. Additionally, avoiding sedating medications and reducing opioid use can help improve mental status.
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): Although the patient does not meet strict criteria for SBP, a 7-day course of antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) is being given as prophylaxis, followed by placement on long-term prophylaxis.
4. Liver Laceration: The patient had a liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxemia, encephalopathy, liver laceration, fractures, acute kidney injury, and aspiration risk.

Potential Medical Complications:

2. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status indicates hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of cirrhosis.
3. Liver Laceration: The patient has a history of liver laceration due to a motor vehicle accident. This may lead to further complications such as bleeding or infection.
4. Fractures: The patient has T8 fractures, which may require conservative management or surgical intervention.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, which could be due to blood loss, ATN, or volume overload.
6. Aspiration Risk: The patient has an increased risk of aspiration due to his altered mental status and inability to protect his airway.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and previous trauma. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea, and is now showing improvement. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxemia, potential hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), abdominal distention, and hepatic encephalopathy. He also has a history of liver laceration from a motor vehicle accident, fractured T8 vertebrae, and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which can be caused by various factors such as respiratory infections or volume overload.

2. HAP/VAP: There is a concern for hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia due to the patient's increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. This could be due to aspiration, colonization of the airways, or an infection.

3. Abdominal distention: The patient's abdomen is distended, which could be due to ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) or bowel obstruction. This can contribute to respiratory difficulty and should be evaluated further.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of alcohol cirrhosis and is showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by confusion, agitation, and changes"

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and previous trauma. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple comorbidities including MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), liver laceration, T8 fracture, and acute renal failure (ARF).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement is likely due to volume overload, considering his large volume ascites that was removed on [11-9]. He is now being positioned in bed and ideally in a chair to optimize pulmonary mechanics.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy secondary to cirrhosis. Multifactorial causes include previous hypernatremia, ICU delirium, pain, and liver dysfunction. Lactulose therapy will be continued, but it is not safe for oral administration. The patient is being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin and will then be placed on prophylaxis.
3. Liver laceration: The patient received multiple blood products and cryoprecipitate for this condition. His hematocrit (HCT) has been stable, so it will be monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and presented with multiple injuries including a liver laceration, tibia fracture, and T8 vertebral fracture. The patient also had a hemoperitoneum treated medically and was diagnosed with MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He was extubated on 11/3 but required increased oxygen and developed tachypnea with altered mental status. His current condition has improved over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement is likely due to 1-18 volume overload. This is supported by his previous large volume ascites and recent removal of 14L of ascitic fluid. To optimize pulmonary mechanics, the patient should be positioned in an upright position, ideally in a chair.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy. Multifactorial causes of altered mental status include previous hypernatremia, ICU delirium, pain, and liver function abnormalities. Lactulose therapy should be continued, and the patient should not receive sedating medications.
3. Liver laceration: The patient had a liver laceration from the MVA. He received 16 units of packed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and multiple medical issues. He was admitted to the ICU due to increased oxygen requirements, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The patient's conditions include hypoxemia, ascites, encephalopathy, liver laceration, fractures, acute renal failure (ARF), and fever. He is being treated for MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and is also on lactulose therapy for encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's increasing oxygen requirements indicate potential respiratory distress or compromised lung function. This may be due to volume overload or underlying pulmonary issues such as atelectasis, as seen on the chest X-ray.

2. Ascites: The patient has a history of liver failure and has undergone multiple large-volume paracentesis due to ascites. There is a risk of reaccumulation, which can lead to complications like spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or hepatic hydrothorax.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient is suffering from hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver dysfunction. It can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms. Management involves lactulose therapy and avoidance of precipitating factors.

4. Liver Laceration: The patient had a liver l"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and previous trauma. He was admitted to the MICU for increasing oxygen requirements and altered mental status. The patient has been treated for MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is now extubated. He has a history of liver failure with ascites and underwent multiple large-volume paracentesis with reaccumulation. The patient also has a T8 compression fracture from a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and is being managed conservatively. He has acute renal failure (ARF) with a rising creatinine level and is off lasix. The patient is also being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with ciprofloxacin and has hepatic encephalopathy. He is on lactulose therapy and will continue to follow up with his healthcare team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement may be due to volume overload, as indicated by the need for albumin and free water. This could be a result of the large-volume paracentesis and reaccumulation of ascites.

2. Ascites: The patient has chronic liver failure leading to ascites. Despite multiple large-volume paracentesis, the ascites has reaccumulated. Monitoring abdominal pressure via bladder pressure is recommended to assess for compartment syndrome.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements and altered mental status. The patient has a past medical history of trauma, including a motor vehicle accident resulting in a dens fracture and hemoperitoneum, as well as a TIPS procedure with subsequent thrombosis. He also has MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with vancomycin. The patient's current condition is stable on 4 liters of oxygen. He has had multiple large-volume paracentesis for ascites and reaccumulation. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement is likely due to 1-18 volume overload. He previously improved with large-volume paracentesis. Continue vancomycin until 11-18, optimize pulmonary mechanics.
2. Ascites: The patient has [1-18] liver failure with ascites that has recurred after large-volume paracentesis. Follow abdominal pressure via bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome, maintain head-of-bed elevation greater than 45 degrees to reduce aspiration risk.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis. Multifactorial causes include previous hypernatremia, ICU delirium, and pain. Continue lactulose therapy, avoid sed"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea secondary to increasing abdominal ascites. The patient had a motor vehicle accident (MVA) resulting in dens/T8 fractures and hemoperitoneum, which was medically managed. He was extubated but required high levels of oxygen support.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory difficulty: The patient's respiratory status improved significantly with a large volume paracentesis to remove ascitic fluid. He is currently on 4L NC (nasal cannula) and is expected to continue improving.
2. Infection: The patient had MRSA in sputum when intubated and was being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Vancomycin was continued for a 10-day course to complete the treatment.
3. Altered mental status/cirrhosis: The patient's mental status is improving with lactulose, antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), large volume paracentesis, improvement of renal function, and discontinuation of sedatives.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.2, which increased to 2.7. Renal failure is likely multifactorial due to hypotension, pre-renal state, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It is less likely to be hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) given the response to intravenous fluids and albumin.
5. Liver laceration: The patient had a liver laceration from the MVA, which was managed medically with packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, and factor VII infusion. Bladder pressures decreased after a large volume paracentesis.
6. Dens/T8 fractures: Conservative management was recommended by neurosurgery due to the fractures. The patient is allowed to be out of bed to improve respiratory status.
7. Diabetes mellitus: The insulin scale was increased due to hyperglycemia.
8. Hypothyroidism: Synthroid IV is being continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient may experience respiratory difficulties due to the underlying liver cirrhosis and the presence of ascitic fluid. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.
2. Infection: Despite being treated for VAP and SBP, there is a risk of developing new infections due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Renal complications: The patient's renal function is currently impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of renal parameters and appropriate management are necessary.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient had a liver laceration and received blood products. There is a risk of bleeding complications,"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea secondary to increasing abdominal ascites. The patient has a past medical history of multiple vehicle accident (MVA) resulting in dens fracture T8 and hemoperitoneum, which was medically managed. 

Upon admission, the patient was on 4 liters of nasal cannula (NC) oxygen and later transferred to the MICU for further management. He required increased oxygen up to 6L NC but is now back down to 4L NC. The patient showed significant improvement in respiratory status after a large volume paracentesis x2, removing 11 liters of ascitic fluid. 

The patient also had treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the sputum while intubated. The Legionella urinary antigen test (LENI) was negative, and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) could not be performed due to renal failure. 

Meropenem was discontinued on [**2172-11-11**] as there was no chest X-ray infiltrate and no evidence of gram-negative rods in the sputum. Vancomycin is being continued to complete a 10-day course from re-admission to the MICU ending on [**2172-11-18**].

The patient's mental status is improving with lactulose, antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), large volume paracentesis, improvement of renal function, and discontinuation of sedatives. Ascitic fluid is consistent with SBP, though it is difficult to interpret in the setting of hemoperitoneum (s/p MVA).

The patient has low-grade fever almost every morning. Ciprofloxacin was started to treat SBP (day 1 = [**11-8**]). A diagnostic paracentesis is planned today. Albumin 50 gm has been administered, along with octreotide and midodrine. Sedating medications are being held, and lactulose, rifaximin, and lactulose are being titrated to 2-18 bms/d. Ursodiol is being continued, and follow-up cultures and liver recommendations are pending.

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a baseline creatinine of 1.2, which has increased to 2.7 yesterday. The patient responded dramatically to albumin yesterday, similar to the prior albumin challenge, but urine output then quickly tapered down to 15-20 ml/hr. Renal failure is multifactorial secondary to hypotension and pre-renal azotemia (ATN). Less likely to be hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) given the response to intravenous fluids/albumin.

Diuretics are being withheld, and renal recommendations are being followed. Renal dosing of all medications is being done. The patient had a liver laceration s/p MVA, which was medically managed with 16u packed red blood cells, 8u fresh frozen plasma, 2u platelets, 2u cryoprecipitate, and F7 infusion. Bladder pressures were 17 prior to paracentesis on [**11-9**], with a decrease to 12 post-procedure. Heparin subcutaneous was discontinued due to hemoperitoneum and rising partial thromboplastin time.

Trend hematocrit and active traces are being monitored. The patient is currently full weight-bearing per neurology, so okay to get out of bed to improve respiratory status. A hard cervical collar is recommended for 3 months, and encouragement is being given to get out of bed.

The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed by increasing the insulin scale due to hyperglycemia. Hypothyroidism is being managed with synthetic thyroid hormone."

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a medical history of ethanol cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea secondary to increasing abdominal ascites. The patient also had a motor vehicle accident (MVA) resulting in a dens fracture at T8 and hemoperitoneum, which was medically managed.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory difficulty with hypoxia/tachypnea on admission, improved respiratory status after large volume paracentesis, treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and negative Leni's for clostridium difficile infection. The patient's mental status has improved with lactulose, antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and large volume paracentesis.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure (ARF) with a baseline creatinine of 1.2, elevated to 2.7 yesterday, and responded dramatically to albumin and free water resuscitation. The renal failure is believed to be multifactorial due to hypotension and pre-renal state, less likely to be hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) given the response to intravenous fluid/albumin. The patient's liver laceration from the MVA has been medically managed with packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma"

   54yoM ETOH cirrhosis, DM, hypothyroidism, transferred from OSH [**10-27**]
   post-MVA, c/b dens fx-T8 fx, and hemoperitoneum treated medically, was
   transferred to MICU for increasing O2 requirements and tachypnea
   secondary to increasing abdominal ascites.
   # Respiratory difficulty: with hypoxia/tachypnea on admission. Was on
   4L NC since extubation, was transferred to MICU for increasing O2
   requirement up to 6LNC, now back down to 4L NC.  Likely secondary to
   increasing abdominal ascites.  Significant improvement of respiratory
   status with large volume paracentesis x 2 (11L of ascitic fluid
   removed).  Patient also currently getting treatment for VAP ( MRSA in
   sputum when intubated).  LENIs were negative, unable to get CTA due to
   renal failure.  Meropenem d/c
ed on [**2172-11-11**] as there was no CXR
   infiltrate and no evidence of GNR in sputum.

   # Altered mental status/cirrhosis.  Mental status improving with
   lactulose, antibiotics for PNA and SBP, large volume paracentesis,
   improvement of renal function, and discontinuation of sedatives.
   Ascitic fluid consistent with SBP, though difficult to interpret in
   setting of hemoperitoneum (s/p MVA).
   - cipro to treat SBP (day 1 = [**11-8**])
   - hold sedating medications
   - lactulose, rifaxamin, titrate to [**2-18**] bms/d
   - cont ursodiol
   - f/u cultures
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr of 1.2, up to 2.7 yesterday.  Patient responded
   dramatically to albumin and free water yesterday, now with Cr of 2.0.
   Renal feels renal failure is multifactorial secondary to hypotension
   and pre-renal state
 ATN.  Less likely to be HRS given response to
   IVF/albumin.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - challenge with albumin again

   - trend hematocrit
   - active t/s
   # Dens/T8 fxs: s/p MVA. Neurosurg recommended conservative management.
   Currently full weight bearing per neurology, so okay to get OOB to
   improve respiratory status.
   - hard cervical collar x3 months

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea secondary to increasing abdominal ascites. The patient had a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and suffered a dens/T8 fractures, which were managed conservatively. He also had a liver laceration that was medically managed. The patient's mental status improved with lactulose, antibiotics for pneumonia (PNA) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), large volume paracentesis, improvement of renal function, and discontinuation of sedatives. The patient's renal function has been multifactorial, likely due to hypotension and pre-renal state ATN. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory difficulty: The patient had difficulty breathing initially due to increased abdominal ascites, but this improved significantly with large volume paracentesis. However, if ascites continues to accumulate or if respiratory support is inadequate, the patient may experience recurrent respiratory difficulties.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is improving with lactulose, antibiotics, and large volume paracentesis. However, if these measures are not continued or if there is a worsening of liver function, hepatic encephalopathy may recur.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has been affected, likely due to hyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, pneumonia acquired during hospitalization, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired cough, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, hepatic encephalopathy, liver function abnormalities, pain control, rib fracture, thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture without spinal cord injury, anemia secondary to blood loss, coagulopathy, acute respiratory failure, trauma post surgery, and allergies to penicillins.

24-hour events include urine output of 825 mL after albumin challenge, then tapered down to 15-20 mL/hr. Insulin was increased to NPH 17 units. The patient became confused and attempted to pull the nasogastric tube.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/65 mmHg to 131/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 97.5 kg, and height is 68 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,867 mL, including 1,073 mL of IV fluids. Total output is 2,255 mL, with 755 mL of urine output. The patient received 477 mL of blood products and had a NG tube output of 1,500 mL.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and the patient's ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment also not assessed.

Lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 11.0 to 13.7 K/uL, hemoglobin ranging from 26.8% to 30.3 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 311 to 351 K/uL, blood glucose levels between 128 and 161 mg/dL, creatinine levels between 1.9 and 2.9 mg/dL, and liver function tests within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type I, dyspnea, pneumonia acquired during hospitalization, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired cough, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, hepatic encephalopathy, liver function abnormalities, pain control, rib fracture, thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture without spinal cord injury, anemia secondary to blood loss, coagulopathy, acute respiratory failure, trauma post surgery, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of fever of unknown origin and pneumonia.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state due to uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or worsening respiratory failure due to impaired ventilation and pneumonia.
4. Acute kidney injury or worsening renal failure due to inadequate urine output and elevated creatinine levels.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy or worsening liver function abnormalities due to liver dysfunction.
6. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and coagulopathy.
7. Pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to impaired mobility and prolonged bed rest.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening lung infection due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
9. Catheter-related bloodstream infection due to indwelling lines and catheters.
10. Delirium or worsening cognitive impairment due to multiple organ dysfunction and sepsis.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's progress note, and further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management of potential medical complications."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The patient has been treated for MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ascites due to liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient has a history of increased oxygen requirements and tachypnea, indicating possible respiratory distress or compromised lung function.
2. Volume Overload: The patient shows signs of fluid overload, as evidenced by albumin and free water administration, as well as previous improvement with large-volume paracentesis.
3. Ascites: The patient has recurrent ascites due to liver failure, which can lead to complications such as infection or further liver damage if not managed properly.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by cognitive dysfunction and altered mental status due to liver dysfunction.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), indicated by rising creatinine levels and previous blood loss.
6. Fever: The patient has had intermittent fevers without a clear source, potentially indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and previous traumatic brain injury. He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, increasing oxygen requirements, and tachypnea. The patient has been treated for MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and his condition has improved. He also has a history of multiple large-volume paracentesis for ascites, which has reaccumulated. The patient is being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with ciprofloxacin. He has a history of liver laceration from a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and is currently being managed conservatively. The patient also has T8 vertebral fractures and is recommended to wear a hard cervical collar for three months. He has acute renal failure (ARF) with a rising creatinine level, possibly due to blood loss or acute tubular necrosis. The patient is currently volume overloaded but still shows signs of hypovolemia. He responded well to a hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HRS) challenge with albumin and is scheduled for another challenge today. The patient's fever spikes every morning at 4 am, and he has pending blood and urine cultures. He is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle accident, resulting in a dens fracture and hemoperitoneum. The patient was initially intubated but was extubated and then returned to the ICU due to respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with vancomycin. His current condition is stable, with improved mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypoxemia, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, liver laceration, T8 fracture, acute renal failure (ARF), fever, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and has a history of volume overload. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels is necessary, and efforts should be made to optimize pulmonary mechanics.
2. Ascites: The patient has a history of liver failure and recurrent large-volume paracentesis. Monitoring abdominal pressure via bladder pressure is important to assess for compartment syndrome.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including ICU delirium, pain, previous hypernatremia, and liver dysfunction. Lactulose therapy should be continued, and measures to prevent aspiration should be taken.
4. Liver Laceration: The patient had a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea due to abdominal ascites. The patient was intubated but later extubated after a large volume paracentesis removed 11 liters of ascitic fluid. He now has improved respiratory status and is not requiring supplemental oxygen. The patient also had a motor vehicle accident (MVA) resulting in dens/T8 fractures, liver laceration, and hemoperitoneum. He was managed medically with blood products and cryoprecipitate. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory difficulty, altered mental status with hepatic encephalopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Difficulty: The patient initially had respiratory difficulty with hypoxia and tachypnea on admission. He required intubation but improved after large volume paracentesis. However, there is a potential risk of recurrent respiratory distress due to worsening abdominal ascites or development of pneumonia.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient intermittently experiences confusion and has hepatic encephalopathy. Improvements have been seen with lactulose, antibiotics, large volume paracentesis, and discontinuation of sedatives. Continued monitoring and management of hepatic encephalopathy is necessary.

3. Acute Renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory difficulty due to increasing abdominal ascites, which improved significantly after a large-volume paracentesis. He also had suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by MRSA, for which he received meropenem and vancomycin. There is no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) based on the diagnostic paracentesis. The patient's altered mental status has improved with lactulose, antibiotics, large-volume paracentesis, and improvement in renal function. He has acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to hypotension and pre-renal azotemia, but responded well to albumin. The patient also has a liver laceration from a motor vehicle accident (MVA), medically managed with blood products and cryoprecipitate. His dens/T8 fractures are being conservatively managed by neurosurgery. He has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism, for which appropriate medications are being given. The patient is currently on full enteral nutrition and receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   # Respiratory difficulty: with hypoxia/tachypnea on admission.
   Extubated on surgical service but then required 6L [**Hospital 2928**] transferred to
   MICU. Likely secondary to increasing abdominal ascites.  Significant
   improvement of respiratory status with large volume paracentesis x 2

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory difficulty, which improved with large-volume paracentesis to remove ascitic fluid. He also had a liver laceration, multiple rib fractures, and a dens/T8 fracture from a motor vehicle accident. The patient has shown improvement in his respiratory status and mental status, but still exhibits signs of hepatic encephalopathy and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient's diagnostic para showed grossly bloody fluid with many polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), but it was not clear if this indicated a new or persistent SBP. The ascitic fluid was culture-negative for bacteria.
2. Hepatic Hydrothorax: The patient's respiratory difficulty could be secondary to increasing abdominal ascites causing hepatic hydrothorax, which is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space due to portal hypertension.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient had MRSA in his sputum while intubated and was treated with meropenem, but there was no evidence of GNR infection. Vancomycin was continued as part of the treatment plan.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's renal function improved after"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient has been diagnosed with fever of unknown origin (FUO), diabetes mellitus type I, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), impaired arousal, attention, cognition, cough, knowledge, muscle performance, transfers, ventilation, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, cervical fracture (without spinal cord injury), hepatic encephalopathy, liver function abnormalities, pain control (acute and chronic), rib fracture, thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture (TLS without spinal cord injury), anemia secondary to blood loss, coagulopathy, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), trauma status post (S/P), and possibly hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 127/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a range of 10.4-13.7 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) with a range of 26.8-30.3%, moderately elevated platelet count (Plt) at 324 K/uL, increased creatinine (Cr) with a range of 1.9-2.9 mg/dL, and altered liver function tests (ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili). The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated serum sodium (Na+) level of 150 mEq/L.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (meropenem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin), midodrine, octreotide, albumin for HRS, pantoprazole (Protonix), and nutrition through enteral feeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, infections (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection), and further deterioration of respiratory function."

   Disposition: ICU care for now
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory difficulty due to hypoxia and tachypnea secondary to increasing abdominal ascites. The patient required intubation but was extubated on surgical service. However, he required 6 liters of supplemental oxygen and was subsequently transferred back to the MICU. 

The patient underwent two large-volume paracenteses, removing a total of 11 liters of ascitic fluid, which resulted in significant improvement of his respiratory status. He is now satting well on no supplemental oxygen. The patient was also diagnosed with possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He was treated with meropenem but it was discontinued as there were no signs of GNR in the sputum.

The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis has led to complications such as ascites and a recent episode of hemoperitoneum. Diagnostic paracentesis showed no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently receiving albumin, octreotide, midodrine, ciprofloxacin, lactulose, and rifaximin. Further hepatology recommendations are pending.

The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. His mental status has improved with lactulose, antibiotics for P"

   Disposition: ICU care for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and presented with respiratory difficulty due to increasing abdominal ascites. The patient was initially intubated but was later extubated and required supplemental oxygen. After a large volume paracentesis, the patient's respiratory status improved, and they were able to breathe without supplemental oxygen.

The patient also had a liver laceration from the MVA, which was managed medically. They received 16 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 2 units of platelets, 2 units of cryoprecipitate, and F7 infusion. The patient's hematocrit has been stable since then, around 29%.

The patient also had dens/T8 fractures from the MVA and was recommended conservative management by neurosurgery. The patient is currently able to bear full weight on their affected limb.

Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypothyroidism. The patient's DM requires an increased insulin scale due to hyperglycemia, and the hypothyroidism is being treated with IV synthroid.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient has shown improvement in their respiratory status with large volume paracentesis and no evidence of spontaneous bacterial per"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with poor dentition. They have diminished breath sounds at the bases, indicating potential lung involvement. The patient's extremities show peripheral pulses but with reduced volume, suggesting possible circulatory issues. The abdominal examination reveals a distended abdomen with bowel sounds present, which may indicate gastrointestinal problems. Neurological assessment shows purposeful movements and normal tone.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Complications: The diminished breath sounds at the bases could indicate a possible pneumonia or another form of respiratory infection. This can be further complicated by the patient's use of a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery, which may increase the risk of aspiration.
2. Circulatory Complications: The reduced volume of peripheral pulses suggests potential circulatory issues such as peripheral arterial disease or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These conditions can lead to compromised blood flow and tissue perfusion.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The distended abdomen with bowel sounds present may indicate gastrointestinal issues like bowel obstruction or ileus. These conditions can cause discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and potential sepsis if not managed promptly.
4. Infection: The presence of poor dentition increases the risk of oral infections, which can potentially lead to systemic infections like sepsis if left untreated.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and intervene early to prevent these potential complications from"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and previous transfer for orthopedic surgery. He presented with multiple medical conditions including MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, liver laceration, and fractures of the dens and T8. The patient is currently being treated for VAP with vancomycin and is on noninvasive ventilation. He has a history of large-volume paracentesis for ascites and has shown improvement with each procedure. The patient's mental status has improved over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's recent oxygen requirement may be due to volume overload, as evidenced by his response to large-volume paracentesis. This suggests a risk of recurrent hypoxemia if fluid overload is not managed appropriately.

2. Ascites: The patient has recurrent ascites despite previous large-volume paracentesis. Continued monitoring of abdominal pressure and consideration of further interventions may be necessary to prevent reaccumulation.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, which requires ongoing management with lactulose therapy. Other contributing factors such as previous hypernatremia, ICU delirium, and pain should also be addressed to optimize mental status.

4. Spinal Fractures: The patient has fractures of the dens and T8. Conservative"

   Assessment and Plan
   54yoM ETOH cirrhosis (s/p TIPS and TIPs thrombosis), DM,
   hypothyroidism, transferred f/OSH [**10-27**] post-MVA, c/b dens fx-T8 fx,
   and hemoperitoneum treated medically ([**2177-10-28**]), also with MRSA VAP,
   extubated on [**11-3**] , transferred to MICU for increasing O2 requirements
   and tachypnea with altered mental status much improved over the past 24
   hrs.
    > Hypoxemia
 Recent O2 requirement likely [**1-18**] volume overload given
   the albumin and free water he required and previously improved with
   large volume paracentesis (removed 14L on [**11-9**]).  Being treated for
   VAP with vanco.  Now on 1L NC
   -          Continue vanc until [**11-18**]
   -          Optimize pulmonary mechanics
   -          Wean as tolerated
   > Ascites
 [**1-18**] liver failure. s/p multiple large volume paracentesis
   with reaccumlation
   -        follow abd pressure via bladder pressure to assess for
   compartment syndrome
   -        HOB > 45 degrees given risk for aspiration
   > Encephalopathy - +etoh cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopath( not on
   transplant list).   Multifactorial causes to altered MS [**First Name (Titles) 2905**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 2906**]ted liver function, previous hypernatremia, ICU delirium and
   pain all of which are improved to various degrees.  Would cont  the
   lactulose therapy as previous, still not safe for PO. Also he does not
   meet strict criteria for SBP but we are treating for a 7 day course and
   then will place on prophylaxis
   -          ciprofloxacin as treatment for 7 day course (ending [**11-17**])
   and then prophylaxis
   -          hold lasix/diuretics given ARF
   -          hold sedating medications
   -          lactulose, rifaxamin, titrate to [**2-18**] bms/d,
   -          cont ursodiol
    > Liver laceration: s/p MVA, medically managed 16uPRBCs, 8uFFP, 2u
   platelets, 2u-cryo, +F7 infusion, with stable hct since, ~29, with
   check of 27 today, and his HCT has been stable.
   -          trend hct it has been stable. Will cont to follow.
   -          active t/s
   > dens/T8 fxs: nsg recommended conservative management . Will discuss
   can we sit him up?
   -          hard cervical collar x3 months
   -          T8 wedge fracture, trauma recs for NWB, HOB 45 degs.
   > ARF: Cr bl 1.2, then with rise to 2.0 on admit, thought 2/2 blood
   loss, ?ATN (no documented hypotension).  Had been on lasix gtt during
   hospitalization, now off.  Cont to follow renal function and bladder
   pressures.  He responded well to a HRS challenge with 1gm/kg albumin on
   [**11-9**].  He is overall volume overloaded, however he has low Na and Cl
   consistent with hypovolemia, responds to albumin.  Creatinine now
   slowly improving.  Renal is following and their input is appreciated.
   -          continue with albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   > Hypernatremia: Stable on increased free water flushes
   -          Increase free water flushes more
   Other issues per resident note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis (alcohol-related liver disease), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and multiple medical issues. He has been admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and altered mental status, which have improved over the past 24 hours. The patient is currently being treated for MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin. 

The patient's assessment and plan include several conditions and their respective management strategies. These include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is likely experiencing volume overload due to previous large-volume paracentesis. He is being treated with vancomycin until November 18th, and his pulmonary mechanics are being optimized. Weaning from oxygen as tolerated is recommended.
2. Ascites: The patient has liver failure with recurrent ascites despite multiple large-volume paracentesis. He will be monitored for abdominal pressure to assess for compartment syndrome, and his head of bed (HOB) will be elevated to reduce the risk of aspiration.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy related to cirrhosis. Multifactorial causes for altered mental status are being addressed, including previous hypernatremia, ICU delirium, pain, and liver dysfunction. Lactulose therapy will continue, but the patient is not safe for oral intake. Prophylaxis with cipro"
