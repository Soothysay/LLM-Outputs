   Fluid analysis / Other labs: [**4-9**] CMV: negative
   Imaging: [**4-10**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
   estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
   = 40 %) with more significant hypokinesis of the septum The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
   function. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent
   with right ventricular volume overload. The ascending aorta is
   moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-cm2). Moderate (2+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
   suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
   pressure. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
   pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2152-10-20**], left ventricular systolic function is now impaired. The
   severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased. The severity of
   aortic regurgitation has increased. The other findings are similar.
   [**4-9**] CXR:
   The central venous line tip is at the right atrium, newly inserted. No
   evidence of pneumothorax or apical hematoma is demonstrated. The
   cardiomegaly is still present, slightly better since [**2153-1-26**].
   There is interval development of right lower lobe opacity compared to
   [**2153-4-4**], that is most likely representing aspiration or
   combination of aspiration and pleural effusion, although infectious
   process cannot be excluded. Mild volume overload is present in the
   perihilar areas, thus asymmetric pulmonary edema is another
   possibility. Clinical correlation is recommended with close followup
   with chest radiographs.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3136**] is a 70 yo F with PMH AFib, hypertension, DM with ESRD s/p
   renal transplant admitted with abdominal/back pain [**1-29**] spinal stenosis
   with course c/b UTI, acute on chronic renal failure, altered mental
   status and hyponatremia.
   .
   #Hyponatremia: thought hypovolemic hyponatremia by the floor team, with
   urine lytes consistent with prerenal syndrome with urine sodium < 20.
   She was given 1LNS on [**4-6**], 500 ml NS on [**4-7**] and then started on
   D5/sodium bicarbonate at 70ml/hr however sodium worsened to 122 from
   139 on admission.  Floor team worried that may be contributing to poor
   mental status so she was transferred to the ICU for hypertonic saline.
   Other consideration could be hyponatremia due to adrenal insufficiency
   given that she also has hyperkalemia and relative hypotension and is on
   chronic steroids.
   -IVF bolus x one liter, check urine sodium pre and post
   -stress dose steroids, not checking cortisol b/c on chronic steroids
   -check echocardiogram in the morning to eval for new heart failure/poor
   cardiac output
   -if no response to IVF bolus then will give 3% saline at 20cc/hr,
   repeat sodium q2 hours and d/c once Na 130
   -check free T4 (TSH slightly elevated)
   .
   #Altered Mental Status: thought most likely to be multifactorial due to
   possible infection ?UTI, acute on chronic renal failure with uremia,
   hyponatremia.  Per floor team she has improved somewhat since
   ceftriaxone started for UTI.  She did get sedatives during tunnelled
   line placement, likely contributing to AMS on arrival to the unit.  She
   had head MRI and CT which did not show any acute abnormalities.
   -continue to treat for UTI with ceftriaxone, discuss with renal team
   need to continue this in the morning
   -f/u blood cultures
   -EEG per neuro reccs
   -f/u neuro reccs
   -f/u fungal cultures
   -treat for adrenal insufficiency
   .
   #Proptosis, conjunctival injection - on exam eyes are protruding
   bilaterally, per patients daughter this is new over the past 2-3 days
   and seems to be fluctuating in severity.  In setting of altered mental
   status, concerning for possiblity of cavernous sinous thrombosis.  Has
   had MRI but not with contrast [**1-29**] CKD.
   -opthamology consult
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - likely [**1-29**] acute on chronic renal failure vs adrenal
   insufficiency.
   -monitor K closely
   -likely will require dialysis in the morning
   -insulin/d50/glucose and kayexalate prn
   .
   #Acute on chronic kidney disease s/p transplant: unclear cause by
   creatinine has been trending up, concerning for transplant rejection
   with worsening hyperkalemia and volume overload.  Other consideration
   is NSAID induced given that pt was taking NSAIDS for acute gout flare
   prior to admission.  Other possibilities are prerenal failure due to
   adrenal insfficiency vs poor cardiac output vs volume depletion.  FENA
   is consistent with prerenal etiology.  No evidence of post renal
   obstruction.  Infection ie. CMV also possible given that tacro level is
   elevated.
   -Tacrolimus level too high, tacro was d/c'd by the floor team, f/u am
   level
   -Tunnelled HD line placed today
   - may require initiation of dialysis tomorrow
   -f/u renal reccs
   -f/u cmv viral load
   -stress dose steroids
   -f/u potassium, treat hyperkalemia with insulin/d50/calcium gluc prn
   -continue calcitriol, calcium carbonate
   .
   # Back/Abdominal Pain: Thought to most likely to be due to lumbar
   spinal stenosis and radiculopathy seen on CT abdomen/pelvis.
   -f/u neurology reccs
   -f/u neurosurgery consult (called on [**4-8**])
   .
   #Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - currently in NSR on transfer
   -resume coumadin now that line is placed
   -touch base w/renal ?plan for biopsy (if so would want to continue
   holding coumadin)
   -bradycardic
   -continue amiodarone
   .
   #Diabetes - stable, continue outpatient meds
   -nph [**Hospital1 7**], HISS

   # HTN - has been hypotensive
   -holding lisinopril, hydralazine, lasix

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent renal transplant. She was admitted with abdominal/back pain, altered mental status, and hyponatremia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 134/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals an obese and distended abdomen with a reducible umbilical hernia, no apparent tenderness to palpation, and chronic venous stasis changes in the lower extremities.

Laboratory findings indicate hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies show evidence of pulmonary congestion, possible aspiration or pleural effusion, and no pericardial effusion. The echocardiogram reveals moderate global left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired left ventricular systolic function, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, and increased severity of aortic regurgitation.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial due to possible infection, acute on chronic renal failure with uremia, and hyponatremia."

   renal transplant admitted with abdominal/back pain [**1-29**] spinal stenosis
   with course c/b UTI, acute on chronic renal failure, altered mental
   status and hyponatremia.
   .
   #Hyponatremia: thought hypovolemic hyponatremia by the floor team, with
   urine lytes consistent with prerenal syndrome with urine sodium < 20.
   She was given 1LNS on [**4-6**], 500 ml NS on [**4-7**] and then started on
   D5/sodium bicarbonate at 70ml/hr however sodium worsened to 122 from
   139 on admission.  Floor team worried that may be contributing to poor
   mental status so she was transferred to the ICU for hypertonic saline.
   Other consideration could be hyponatremia due to adrenal insufficiency
   given that she also has hyperkalemia and relative hypotension and is on
   chronic steroids.  Improved with dialysis [**4-10**]
   -cont to trend
   -stress dose steroids, will begin taper
   -echo with new depressed EF at 40%
   - no need for hypertonic saline currently
   - free T4 normal
   .
   #Altered Mental Status: thought most likely to be multifactorial due to
   possible infection ?UTI, acute on chronic renal failure with uremia,
   hyponatremia.  Per floor team she has improved somewhat since
   ceftriaxone started for UTI.  She did get sedatives during tunnelled
   line placement, likely contributing to AMS on arrival to the unit.  She
   had head MRI and CT which did not show any acute abnormalities.
   Hyponatremia likely contributing.  Intervally improved per family.
   -Finished short course of CTX -> will D/C [**4-11**]
   -f/u blood cultures
   -EEG performed, follow up read
   -f/u neuro reccs
   -f/u fungal cultures
   -treat for adrenal insufficiency as per above
   .
   #Proptosis, conjunctival injection - on exam eyes are protruding
   bilaterally, per patients daughter this is new over the past 2-3 days
   and seems to be fluctuating in severity.  Patient states this is
   chronic.  Spoke with neurology, unlikely to be cavernous sinus
   thrombosis.   Has had MRI but not with contrast [**1-29**] CKD, no obvious
   abnormalitis
   - Appreciate ophtho consult
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - likely [**1-29**] acute on chronic renal failure vs adrenal
   insufficiency.  Now stable on HD
   -monitor K closely
   .
   #Acute on chronic kidney disease s/p transplant: unclear cause by
   creatinine has been trending up, concerning for transplant rejection
   with worsening hyperkalemia and volume overload.  Other consideration
   is NSAID induced given that pt was taking NSAIDS for acute gout flare
   prior to admission.  Other possibilities are prerenal failure due to
   adrenal insfficiency vs poor cardiac output vs volume depletion.  FENA
   is consistent with prerenal etiology.  No evidence of post renal
   obstruction.  Infection ie. CMV also possible given that tacro level is
   elevated.
   -Tacrolimus level was too high initially, tacro was d/c'd by the floor
   team, f/u levels
   -Tunnelled HD line placed, HD initiated
   -f/u renal reccs
   -f/u cmv viral load
   -stress dose steroids -> will start to taper back to baseline
   -continue calcitriol, calcium carbonate
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy:  EF intervally worse.  Likely related to chronic
   diseases and possibly uremia.  No obvious ischemic component but would
   not be surpirising.  Clinically euvolemic
   - Cont low dose BB
   - ? renal if ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **] is OK
   - Would benefit from statin
   - Will email cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Back/Abdominal Pain: Thought to most likely to be due to lumbar
   spinal stenosis and radiculopathy seen on CT abdomen/pelvis.
   -f/u neurology reccs
   -f/u neurosurgery consult (called on [**4-8**]) -> no surgical issues
   .
   #Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - currently in NSR on transfer
   -Cont coumadin at outpatient dose
   -touch base w/renal ?plan for biopsy (if so would want to continue
   holding coumadin)
   -bradycardic
   -continue amiodarone
   .
   #Diabetes - stable, continue outpatient meds
   -nph [**Hospital1 7**], HISS
   .
   # HTN - has been hypotensive
   -holding lisinopril, hydralazine, lasix
   .

   Imaging: [**4-10**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
   estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
   = 40 %) with more significant hypokinesis of the septum The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
   function. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent
   with right ventricular volume overload. The ascending aorta is
   moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-cm2). Moderate (2+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
   suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
   pressure. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
   pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2152-10-20**], left ventricular systolic function is now impaired. The
   severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased. The severity of
   aortic regurgitation has increased. The other findings are similar.
   [**4-9**] CXR:
   The central venous line tip is at the right atrium, newly inserted. No
   evidence of pneumothorax or apical hematoma is demonstrated. The
   cardiomegaly is still present, slightly better since [**2153-1-26**].
   There is interval development of right lower lobe opacity compared to
   [**2153-4-4**], that is most likely representing aspiration or
   combination of aspiration and pleural effusion, although infectious
   process cannot be excluded. Mild volume overload is present in the
   perihilar areas, thus asymmetric pulmonary edema is another
   possibility. Clinical correlation is recommended with close followup
   with chest radiographs.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 3136**] is a 70 yo F with PMH AFib, hypertension, DM with ESRD s/p
   renal transplant admitted with abdominal/back pain [**1-29**] spinal stenosis
   with course c/b UTI, acute on chronic renal failure, altered mental
   status and hyponatremia.
   .
   #Hyponatremia: thought hypovolemic hyponatremia by the floor team, with
   urine lytes consistent with prerenal syndrome with urine sodium < 20.
   She was given 1LNS on [**4-6**], 500 ml NS on [**4-7**] and then started on
   D5/sodium bicarbonate at 70ml/hr however sodium worsened to 122 from
   139 on admission.  Floor team worried that may be contributing to poor
   mental status so she was transferred to the ICU for hypertonic saline.
   Other consideration could be hyponatremia due to adrenal insufficiency
   given that she also has hyperkalemia and relative hypotension and is on
   chronic steroids.
   -IVF bolus x one liter, check urine sodium pre and post
   -stress dose steroids, not checking cortisol b/c on chronic steroids
   -check echocardiogram in the morning to eval for new heart failure/poor
   cardiac output
   -if no response to IVF bolus then will give 3% saline at 20cc/hr,
   repeat sodium q2 hours and d/c once Na 130
   -check free T4 (TSH slightly elevated)
   .
   #Altered Mental Status: thought most likely to be multifactorial due to
   possible infection ?UTI, acute on chronic renal failure with uremia,
   hyponatremia.  Per floor team she has improved somewhat since
   ceftriaxone started for UTI.  She did get sedatives during tunnelled
   line placement, likely contributing to AMS on arrival to the unit.  She
   had head MRI and CT which did not show any acute abnormalities.
   -continue to treat for UTI with ceftriaxone, discuss with renal team
   need to continue this in the morning
   -f/u blood cultures
   -EEG per neuro reccs
   -f/u neuro reccs
   -f/u fungal cultures
   -treat for adrenal insufficiency
   .
   #Proptosis, conjunctival injection - on exam eyes are protruding
   bilaterally, per patients daughter this is new over the past 2-3 days
   and seems to be fluctuating in severity.  In setting of altered mental
   status, concerning for possiblity of cavernous sinous thrombosis.  Has
   had MRI but not with contrast [**1-29**] CKD.
   -opthamology consult
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - likely [**1-29**] acute on chronic renal failure vs adrenal
   insufficiency.
   -monitor K closely
   -likely will require dialysis in the morning
   -insulin/d50/glucose and kayexalate prn
   .
   #Acute on chronic kidney disease s/p transplant: unclear cause by
   creatinine has been trending up, concerning for transplant rejection
   with worsening hyperkalemia and volume overload.  Other consideration
   is NSAID induced given that pt was taking NSAIDS for acute gout flare
   prior to admission.  Other possibilities are prerenal failure due to
   adrenal insfficiency vs poor cardiac output vs volume depletion.  FENA
   is consistent with prerenal etiology.  No evidence of post renal
   obstruction.  Infection ie. CMV also possible given that tacro level is
   elevated.
   -Tacrolimus level too high, tacro was d/c'd by the floor team, f/u am
   level
   -Tunnelled HD line placed today
   - may require initiation of dialysis tomorrow
   -f/u renal reccs
   -f/u cmv viral load
   -stress dose steroids
   -f/u potassium, treat hyperkalemia with insulin/d50/calcium gluc prn
   -continue calcitriol, calcium carbonate
   .
   # Back/Abdominal Pain: Thought to most likely to be due to lumbar
   spinal stenosis and radiculopathy seen on CT abdomen/pelvis.
   -f/u neurology reccs
   -f/u neurosurgery consult (called on [**4-8**])
   .
   #Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - currently in NSR on transfer
   -resume coumadin now that line is placed
   -touch base w/renal ?plan for biopsy (if so would want to continue
   holding coumadin)
   -bradycardic
   -continue amiodarone
   .
   #Diabetes - stable, continue outpatient meds
   -nph [**Hospital1 7**], HISS
   .
   # HTN - has been hypotensive
   -holding lisinopril, hydralazine, lasix
   .
   # Access: tunelled dialysis line with VIP port

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus with end-stage renal disease who underwent renal transplantation. She presented with abdominal/back pain, altered mental status, and hyponatremia. The patient's condition has been complex, with multiple potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient initially had hypovolemic hyponatremia, but the sodium level worsened despite fluid resuscitation. This may be due to adrenal insufficiency, especially considering the presence of hyperkalemia and relative hypotension, as well as chronic steroid use.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including possible infection (UTI), acute on chronic renal failure with uremia, and hyponatremia. The patient has shown some improvement since starting ceftriaxone for UTI.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia could be due to acute on chronic renal failure or adrenal insufficiency. Close monitoring of potassium levels is necessary, and the patient may require dialysis.

4. Proptosis and conjunctival injection: The patient's protruding eyes bilaterally suggest the possibility of cavernous sinus thrombosis. An ophthalmology consult is recommended.

5. Acute on chronic kidney disease s/p transplant: The patient's worsening"
