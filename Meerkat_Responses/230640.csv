   Assessment and Plan
 ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 68 yo man with h/o CAD s/p
   CABG in [**2158**], HTN, and DM2, who presented for medical management s/p
   NSTEMI
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed.
    - Start Metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and up-titrate as tolerated.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
    - D/C Heparin gtt, as the patient already has an advanced thrombosis
    - TTE today
    - Start Atorvastatin 80 mg daily and check lipid panel.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry
    - Consider restarting Lisinopril in the am
   .
   # Pump:  The patient does not have a history of CHF, but he had
   extremely high RA, PA, PCWP on cardiac catheterization.  His JVD was
   elevated on physical exam and he had a fixed split S2 (indicative of
   pulmonary hypertension).  He also has crackles on physical exam and a
   new productive cough, likely secondary to pulmonary edema.
    - Give Lasix 60 mg IV tonight for goal diuresis of 1 L
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
    - CXR - Pending
    - TTE today to assess EF and wall motion abnormalities
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU.  This is most likely a reperfusing
   rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on tele.
   .
   # DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine,
   Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration (FSBS in the low 100s)
    - Continue Glargine
    - FSBG and HISS
   .
   #. CKI:  The patient presented with Cr of 1.6, with an unknown baseline
   (0.8 in [**2158**]).  DDx includes pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with
   low CI) v. underlying renal disease [**1-12**] DM2.
    - Check Urine lytes and U/A for sediment in the am
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented for medical management after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient has occluded saphenous vein grafts to the omohyoid marginal branches and one of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed. He is not a candidate for surgical or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), so he will be managed medically.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/61 mmHg to 135/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished and anxious appearance with edematous left eyelid. Cardiovascular examination shows fixed S2 heart sound and poor inspiratory effort. Respiratory examination reveals symmetric chest expansion with bibasilar crackles. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. Extremities show weak pulses in both upper and lower limbs. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, elevated potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels,"

","The patient is a well-nourished, anxious individual with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and shortness of breath. They have been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring due to their unstable vital signs and potential cardiac issues.

Upon reviewing the vital signs, the patient's temperature is slightly below normal at 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F), with a maximum temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F) recorded earlier. Their heart rate is within normal limits at 64 bpm, but their blood pressure is low, ranging from 100/61 mmHg to 135/76 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 21 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is at 98% with the use of a nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received infusions of heparin sodium and ranitidine for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, respectively. They have also received furosemide (Lasix) to aid in fluid balance.

Flowsheet data indicates that the patient has received a total of 580 mL of fluids since midnight, with 120 mL given orally and 260 mL via IV fluids. The patient's urine output is 950 mL, and their blood product transfusion is 0 mL with a total output of 950 mL.

   NSTEMI.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed.
    - DC Metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Start Carvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
    - D/C Heparin gtt, as the patient already has an advanced thrombosis
    - TTE today
    - Start Atorvastatin 80 mg daily and check lipid panel.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry
    - Consider restarting Lisinopril in the am
   .
   # Pump:  The patient does not have a history of CHF, but he had
   extremely high RA, PA, PCWP on cardiac catheterization.  His JVD was
   elevated on physical exam and widened split S2 which may be secondary
   to LBBB in setting of increased pulmonary HTN.   He also has crackles
   on physical exam and a new productive cough, likely secondary to
   pulmonary edema.
    - Give Lasix 60 mg IV tonight for goal diuresis of 1 L
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
    - CXR - Pending
    - TTE today to assess EF and wall motion abnormalities
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU.  This is most likely a reperfusing
   rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on tele.
   .
   # DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine,
   Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration (FSBS in the low 100s)
    - Continue Glargine

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented for medical management of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). 

On admission, the patient had a 12-hour history of chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes (CES) with ST depressions in leads II, III, AVF, and V2-V4. The patient's right internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft is patent, but all saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) are occluded. Severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) and elevated right-sided filling pressures were also noted during cardiac catheterization. The patient is not a surgical or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) candidate, so he will be medically managed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals a well-nourished and anxious appearance with edematous left eyelid, symmetric chest expansion, bibasilar crackles, and poor inspiratory effort. The patient's extremities are cool"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with NSTEMI. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2158**] and also has hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient's current condition includes occluded saphenous vein grafts to the omohyoid muscles, severe pulmonary hypertension, elevated right-sided filling pressures, decreased cardiac output, and elevated left-sided filling pressures as measured by pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).

The patient has been medically managed due to being an unsuitable candidate for surgical or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). His medications include aspirin (ASA) 325 mg daily, clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg daily, carvedilol 6.25 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, and lisinopril. The patient is also on diuretics, specifically furosemide (Lasix) for pulmonary edema management, and has been given a goal diuresis of 1 liter.

The patient's rhythm is primarily sinus rhythm but has experienced runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). He has a history of DM2 and takes multiple medications for it, which have been adjusted due to recent contrast administration. The patient's creatinine (Cr)"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 68 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG
   in [**2158**], HTN, and DM2, who presented for medical management s/p NSTEMI.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed. Episodes of chest pain are concerning that
   medical management may not be enough, and enzymes are trending up.  At
   this point troponin has increased more than 20% since yesterday
   morning, and therefore he has likely had another infarct.
   - Will continue to diurese with Lasix (bolus first, then gtt)
 will
   start with 60mg IV Lasix bolus and then Lasix gtt 5mg/hr in order to
   reduce preload
   - If he does not fully respond to Lasix, will add long acting Nitro as
   patient has complained of chest pressure/pain 3 times in past 24 hours
   - Continue Carvedilol 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] (changed from metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]),
   hold for MAP<65
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Will change Atorvastatin 80 mg daily to another statin as patient as
   complained of leg swelling in past
 will change to Pravastatin 20mg po
   daily
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Consider Surgery consult, but re-operation would be a very high risk
   surgery in this patient and medical management seems more appropriate
   at this time
   .
   # Pump:  The patient does not have a history of CHF, but he had
   extremely high RA, PA, PCWP on cardiac catheterization.  His JVD was
   elevated on physical exam and widened split S2 which may be secondary
   to LBBB in setting of increased pulmonary HTN.   Patient is not as
   fluid overloaded as yesterday as LE edema has improved as well as JVD,
   but continues to have crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema.  His EF was 15-20% on recent TTE, and he
   likely needs continued diuresis to reduce preload.
    - Will continue to diurese as above
   -  Consider fluid restriction
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
    - CXR - nml
    .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10
   beats.  This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. Patient remained
   asymptomatic.
    - Continue to monitor on tele.
   .
   # ANTICOAGULATION: Patient with apical hypokinesis and at risk for
   blood pooling and clot formation.
   - Start heparin drip now
   - Start him on po coumadin and track INR to therapeutic 2.0-3.0
   - Will guaiac his stool to check for GI bleeds
   #DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine,
   Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration (FSBS in the low 100s)
    - Hold Glargine for 12 horus and continue sliding scale.  Will give
   him evening dose of Glargine, likely will be a percentage of 50 units.
   Will calculate insulin needs from sliding scale use today.
    - FSBG and HISS
    - Encourage PO intake
   .
   #. Acute on CKI:  The patient presented with Cr of 1.6, with baseline
   of 1.3.  DDx includes pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low
   CI) v. underlying renal disease [**1-12**] DM2.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.
   # Social Issues: Will call social work to see patient and discuss

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 359**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   [**Hospital 7780**] medical therapy for CAD and CHF.  Will medically manage
   through this episode of recurrent chest pain and recurrent MI given
   lack of revascularization options.  Will determine of apical
   hypokinesis is new or not and determine whether to use longterm
   anticoagulation or not for this. Patient care time 30 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented to the hospital with symptoms of chest pain and was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past and is currently being managed medically due to being an unsuitable candidate for revascularization procedures.

During the 24-hour period, the patient experienced multiple episodes of chest pain, which were managed with medications such as morphine and nitroglycerin. His cardiac enzymes (CK and troponin) showed elevated levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient also had episodes of low blood sugar, leading to the holding of his Lantus dose and adjustment of his insulin regimen.

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he has been on various medications to manage it. His heart rate and respiratory rate were within normal limits. The patient had mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on his echocardiogram, along with severe regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent with multivessel CAD and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. His ejection fraction (EF) was estimated to be 15-20%.

The patient's lung parenchyma appears normal on chest X-ray. His lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 142 mg/dL, triglycerides"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 68 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG
   in [**2158**], HTN, and DM2, who presented for medical management s/p NSTEMI.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed. Episodes of chest pain are concerning that
   medical management may not be enough, and enzymes are trending up.  At
   this point troponin has increased more than 20% since yesterday
   morning, and therefore he has likely had another infarct.
   - Will continue to diurese with Lasix (bolus first, then gtt)
 will
   start with 60mg IV Lasix bolus and then Lasix gtt 5mg/hr in order to
   reduce preload
   - If he does not fully respond to Lasix, will add long acting Nitro as
   patient has complained of chest pressure/pain 3 times in past 24 hours
   - Continue Carvedilol 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] (changed from metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]),
   hold for MAP<65
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Will change Atorvastatin 80 mg daily to another statin as patient as
   complained of leg swelling in past
 will change to Pravastatin 20mg po
   daily
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Consider Surgery consult, but re-operation would be a very high risk
   surgery in this patient and medical management seems more appropriate
   at this time
   .
   # Pump:  The patient does not have a history of CHF, but he had
   extremely high RA, PA, PCWP on cardiac catheterization.  His JVD was
   elevated on physical exam and widened split S2 which may be secondary
   to LBBB in setting of increased pulmonary HTN.   Patient is not as
   fluid overloaded as yesterday as LE edema has improved as well as JVD,
   but continues to have crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema.  His EF was 15-20% on recent TTE, and he
   likely needs continued diuresis to reduce preload.
    - Will continue to diurese as above
   -  Consider fluid restriction
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
    - CXR - nml
    .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10
   beats.  This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. Patient remained
   asymptomatic.
    - Continue to monitor on tele.
   .
   # ANTICOAGULATION: Patient with apical hypokinesis and at risk for
   blood pooling and clot formation.
   - Start heparin drip now
   - Start him on po coumadin and track INR to therapeutic 2.0-3.0
   - Will guaiac his stool to check for GI bleeds
   #DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine,
   Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration (FSBS in the low 100s)
    - Hold Glargine for 12 horus and continue sliding scale.  Will give
   him evening dose of Glargine, likely will be a percentage of 50 units.
   Will calculate insulin needs from sliding scale use today.
    - FSBG and HISS
    - Encourage PO intake
   .
   #. Acute on CKI:  The patient presented with Cr of 1.6, with baseline
   of 1.3.  DDx includes pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low
   CI) v. underlying renal disease [**1-12**] DM2.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.
   # Social Issues: Will call social work to see patient and discuss

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented for medical management after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient has had episodes of chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, and ST depressions in II, III, AVF, and V2-V4. He also has occluded saphenous vein grafts to the omohyoid margin, and one of the grafts appears to be acutely thrombosed.
- The patient is not a surgical or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) candidate and will be optimally medically managed.
- He has been experiencing episodes of chest pressure/pain three times in the past 24 hours, and troponin levels have increased more than 20% since yesterday morning, indicating another infarct.
- The patient will continue to be diuresed with Lasix to reduce preload. If he does not fully respond to Lasix, long-acting nitro will be added.
- He will continue on carvedilol, ASA, and Plavix. Atorvastatin will be changed to pravastatin due to leg swelling.
- The patient will be monitored on telemetry, and a surgery consult"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 68 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG
   in [**2158**], HTN, and DM2, who presented for medical management s/p NSTEMI.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed. Episodes of chest pain are concerning that
   medical management may not be enough, and enzymes are trending up
   - Consider Surgery consult
   - Consider long acting Nitro as patient has complained of chest
   pressure/pain 3 times in past 24 hours
   - Continue Carvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **] (changed from metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **])
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Consider changing Atorvastatin 80 mg daily to another statin as
   patient as complained of leg swelling in past
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Pump:  The patient does not have a history of CHF, but he had
   extremely high RA, PA, PCWP on cardiac catheterization.  His JVD was
   elevated on physical exam and widened split S2 which may be secondary
   to LBBB in setting of increased pulmonary HTN.   Patient is not as
   fluid overloaded as yesterday as LE edema has improved as well as JVD,
   but continues to have crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema.  TTE: EF 15-20%
    - Hold Lasix for now as Cr has increased from 1.6 -> 2.0
   -  Consider Fluid restriction
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
    - CXR - nml
    .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10
   beats.  This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. Patient remained
   asymptomatic.
    - Continue to monitor on tele.
   .
   # DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine,
   Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration (FSBS in the low 100s)
    - Hold Glargine and continue sliding scale for next 24 hours.
   Calculate insulin needs from this.
    - FSBG and HISS
    - Encourage PO intake
   .
   #. CKI:  The patient presented with Cr of 1.6, with baseline of 1.3.
   DDx includes pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low CI) v.
   underlying renal disease [**1-12**] DM2.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2158**]. He presented for medical management of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient has been experiencing episodes of chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, and ST depressions on EKG. He has occluded saphenous vein grafts to the omohyoid marginal branches, and one of the grafts appears to be acutely thrombosed. As the patient is not a surgical or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) candidate, it was determined that he would be optimally medically managed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C (96.9Â°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 97/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals mild left ventricular hypertrophy, severe regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease, and moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient's ejection fraction is estimated to be 15-20%.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin T levels, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and mildly elevated creatinine. The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 68 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG
   in [**2158**], HTN, and DM2, who presented for medical management s/p NSTEMI.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed..  At this point troponin has increased
   more than 20% yesterday, and therefore he has likely had another
   infarct. Currently, has not had an episode of chest pain in the past 24
   hours. Will continue to monitor as he is stable and enzymes trending
   down, with last troponin T 4.18 which has decreased from 4.38 in the
   prior set.
   - Will continue to diurese with Lasix gtt
gtt 5mg/hr in order to
   reduce preload; Consider increasing rate as patient has been oliguric
   in past 16 hours.
   - - Continue Carvedilol 3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **]  and hold for MAP<65
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Changed Atorvastatin 80 mg daily to Pravastatin 40 mg daily ->
   continue to monitor for adverse reactions of leg pain, increased  CK
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Consider Surgery consult, but re-operation would be a very high risk
   surgery in this patient and medical management seems more appropriate
   at this time
   .
   # Pump:  The patient does not have a history of CHF, but he had
   extremely high RA, PA, PCWP on cardiac catheterization.  His JVD was
   elevated on physical exam and widened split S2 which may be secondary
   to LBBB in setting of increased pulmonary HTN.   Patient is not as
   fluid overloaded as yesterday as LE edema has improved as well as JVD,
   but continues to have crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema.  His EF was 15-20% on recent TTE, and he
   likely needs continued diuresis to reduce preload.
    - Will continue to diurese as above
   -  Consider fluid restriction
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10
   beats.  This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. Patient remains
   asymptomatic. Continues to have sinus rhythm with pvcs.
    - Continue to monitor on tele.
   .
   # ANTICOAGULATION: Patient with apical hypokinesis and at risk for
   blood pooling and clot formation. Since patient has had akinesis
   recorded on echo in [**2158**], will not anticoagulate at this time as
   patient is at lower risk in the chronic state.
   -          Hold for now
   -          Guaiac stools next bowel movement
   #DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine
   (65U), Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration (FSBS in the low 100s)
    - Monitor blood sugar today and consider giving glargine this evening
   as patient may need basal coverage.
    - FSBG and HISS
    - Encourage PO intake
   .
   #. Acute on CKI:  The patient presented with Cr of 1.6, with baseline
   of 1.3.  Likely pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low CI);
   based on BUN/Cr ratio >20/1 and FeUn = 28.15%; Also with a history of
   intrinsic chronic renal disease as patient has long standing diabetes
   and hypertension.
   -          Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.
   -          Continue Lasix gtt as patient is fluid overloaded and
   # Social Issues: Social work consult pending

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2.
- He presented with chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, and ST depressions in leads II, III, AVF, and V2-V4.
- He has occluded saphenous vein grafts to the omohyoid muscles and one of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.
- He is not a surgical or PCI candidate, so he is being medically managed.
- His troponin levels have increased more than 20% from yesterday, indicating another infarct.
- He has not experienced chest pain in the past 24 hours, and his enzymes are trending down.
- He is stable and on medical management.
- He has been oliguric for the past 16 hours, so his Lasix gtt has been increased to reduce preload.
- He is on carvedilol 3.125 mg and will be held for MAP < 65.
- He is also taking ASA 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily.
- His atorvastatin 80 mg daily has been changed to pravastatin 40 mg daily.
- He is being monitored on telemetry.
- Surgery consult has been considered, but re-operation is a high-risk surgery, and medical management seems more appropriate at this time.

   Coreg 3.125.  Holding Lasix until SBP>90.
   - Speech/Swallow said he is coughing while eating, but also coughing at
   other times.  ?GERD cough vs stricture? Recommended soft and thin diet,
   and if he's still here on Monday, can do a video swallow study.
   - Switched to pravastatin 40mg po daily
   -
    Given Lasix bolus and gtt - put out 400 in first hour then nothing, so
   increased dose to 10mg/hr - put out 250 in first hour (patient wearing
   condom cath, so urinating in spurts)
   - 2pm lytes showed Cr 1.9 (down from 2.0 in the am)
   - Carvedilol decreased to 3.125mg po bid
   - Sugars 77-160's, decided to d/c glargine dose b/c only requiring 4
   units of insulin sliding scale a day
   - Brief apnic episodes overnight; sats in the 80

   to LBBB in setting of increased pulmonary HTN.   Patient is not as
   fluid overloaded as yesterday as LE edema has improved as well as JVD,
   but continues to have crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema.  His EF was 15-20% on recent TTE, and he

   NSVT since admission to the CCU, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10
   beats.  This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. Patient remains
   asymptomatic. Continues to have sinus rhythm with pvcs.

   #DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine
   (65U), Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration (FSBS in the low 100s)
    - Monitor blood sugar today and consider giving glargine this evening
   as patient may need basal coverage.
    - FSBG and HISS
    - Encourage PO intake
   .
   #. Acute on CKI:  The patient presented with Cr of 1.6, with baseline
   of 1.3.  Likely pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low CI);
   based on BUN/Cr ratio >20/1 and FeUn = 28.15%; Also with a history of
   intrinsic chronic renal disease as patient has long standing diabetes
   and hypertension.
   -          Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.
   -          Continue Lasix gtt as patient is fluid overloaded and

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented for medical management after experiencing a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2158**]. Currently, he is in the ICU for optimization of medical management due to occluded saphenous vein grafts to the obtuse marginal branches. The patient is not a candidate for surgical or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 

Assessment:
1. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient likely had another infarct as evidenced by an increase in troponin levels. He will continue to be monitored for any signs of chest pain or changes in cardiac enzymes.
2. Pump Failure: The patient does not have a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), but he had elevated right atrial (RA), pulmonary artery (PA), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) on cardiac catheterization. Physical examination revealed elevated jugular venous distention (JVD) and a widened split S2, which may be secondary to left bundle branch block (LBBB) in the setting of increased pulmonary hypertension. The patient continues to have crackles on physical examination and a cough, likely secondary to pulmonary edema. His ejection fraction (EF) was 15-20% on recent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and he needs continued diuresis to reduce preload.
3. Rhythm: The patient presented in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) but has had runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) since admission to the critical care unit (CCU). This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm, and the patient remains asymptomatic.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient with apical hypokinesis is at risk for blood pooling and clot formation. Since the patient had akinesis recorded on echo in [**2158**], he will not be anticoagulated at this time as he is at a lower risk in the chronic state.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine (65U), Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home. His fasting blood sugar levels are in the low 100s, so he will continue to monitor blood sugar and may need basal coverage with Glargine.
6. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient presented with a creatinine (Cr) level of 1.6, with a baseline of 1.3. He likely has pre-renal azotemia due to poor forward flow with low cardiac index (CI); this is supported by a BUN/Cr ratio >20/1 and Fe"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 68 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG
   in [**2158**], HTN, and DM2, who presented for medical management s/p NSTEMI.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed..  At this point troponin has increased
   more than 20% yesterday, and therefore he has likely had another
   infarct. Currently, has not had an episode of chest pain in the past 24
   hours. Will continue to monitor as he is stable and enzymes trending
   down, with last troponin T 4.18 which has decreased from 4.38 in the
   prior set.
   - Will continue to diurese with Lasix gtt
 will increase to 20mg/hr
   and aim for negative 1-2L today
   - Will hold ACE-I
   - Stop carvedilol in favor of metoprolol 12.5mg TID in order to
   increase BP
   - When BP stabilizes, will start him on a nitrate (short acting Isordil
   10mg po tid) to improve collateral flow in his coronaries
   - Start digoxin 0.25mg po x 2 today, and then 0.125mg po daily
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Pravastatin 40 mg daily -> continue to monitor for adverse
   reactions of leg pain, increased CK
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Pump:  The patient is slightly fluid overloaded with some improvement
   of his LE edema has improved as well as JVD, but continues to have
   crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely secondary to pulmonary
   edema.  His EF was 15-20% on recent TTE, and he likely needs continued
   diuresis to reduce preload.
    - Will continue to diurese as above
   - Start digoxin, metoprolol as above
   -  Consider fluid restriction
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10
   beats.  This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. Patient remains
   asymptomatic. Continues to have sinus rhythm with pvcs.
    - Continue to monitor on tele.
   .
   # ANTICOAGULATION: Patient with apical hypokinesis and at risk for
   blood pooling and clot formation. Since patient has had akinesis
   recorded on echo in [**2158**], will not anticoagulate at this time as
   patient is at lower risk in the chronic state.
   -          Hold for now
   -          Guaiac stools next bowel movement
   #DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine
   (65U), Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration (FSBS in the low 100s)
    - Monitor blood sugar today and consider giving glargine this evening
   as patient may need basal coverage.
    - FSBG and HISS
    - Encourage PO intake
   .
   #. Acute on CKI:  The patient presented with Cr of 1.6, with baseline
   of 1.3.  Likely pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low CI);
   based on BUN/Cr ratio >20/1 and FeUn = 28.15%; Also with a history of
   intrinsic chronic renal disease as patient has long standing diabetes
   and hypertension.
   -          Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.
   -          Continue Lasix gtt as patient is fluid overloaded and
   # Swallow: Patient had swallow consult and they felt he would benefit
   from soft and thin diet.  Possible video swallow study on Monday.
   # Social Issues: Social work working on rehab for him

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presented for medical management following a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2158. 

The patient presented with chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes, with ST depressions in leads II, III, AVF, and V2-V4. He was found to have occluded saphenous vein grafts to the omohyoid muscles, and one of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed. The patient is not a surgical or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) candidate, so he will be optimally medically managed.

The patient's troponin levels have increased more than 20% from yesterday, indicating another infarct. However, he has not experienced chest pain in the past 24 hours, and his cardiac enzymes are trending down. 

The patient has been diuresed with Lasix and will increase the dose to 20mg/hr to aim for a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters today. ACE inhibitors have been held, and carvedilol has been stopped in favor of metoprolol 12.5mg TID to increase blood pressure. Nitrate therapy will be initiated once blood pressure stabilizes to improve collateral flow in his coronaries"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 68 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG
   in [**2158**], HTN, and DM2, who presented for medical management s/p NSTEMI.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed..  At this point troponin has increased
   more than 20% yesterday, and therefore he has likely had another
   infarct. Currently, has not had an episode of chest pain in the past 24
   hours. Will continue to monitor as he is stable and enzymes trending
   down, with last troponin T 4.18 which has decreased from 4.38 in the
   prior set.
   - Will continue to diurese with Lasix gtt
 will increase to 20mg/hr
   and aim for negative 1-2L today
   - Will hold ACE-I
   - Stop carvedilol in favor of metoprolol 12.5mg TID in order to
   increase BP
   - When BP stabilizes, will start him on a nitrate (short acting Isordil
   10mg po tid) to improve collateral flow in his coronaries
   - Start digoxin 0.25mg po x 2 today, and then 0.125mg po daily
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Pravastatin 40 mg daily -> continue to monitor for adverse
   reactions of leg pain, increased CK
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Pump:  The patient is slightly fluid overloaded with some improvement
   of his LE edema has improved as well as JVD, but continues to have
   crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely secondary to pulmonary
   edema.  His EF was 15-20% on recent TTE, and he likely needs continued
   diuresis to reduce preload.
    - Will continue to diurese as above
   - Start digoxin, metoprolol as above
   -  Consider fluid restriction
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10
   beats.  This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. Patient remains
   asymptomatic. Continues to have sinus rhythm with pvcs.
    - Continue to monitor on tele.
   .
   # ANTICOAGULATION: Patient with apical hypokinesis and at risk for
   blood pooling and clot formation. Since patient has had akinesis
   recorded on echo in [**2158**], will not anticoagulate at this time as
   patient is at lower risk in the chronic state.
   -          Hold for now
   -          Guaiac stools next bowel movement
   #DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine
   (65U), Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration (FSBS in the low 100s)
    - Monitor blood sugar today and consider giving glargine this evening
   as patient may need basal coverage.
    - FSBG and HISS
    - Encourage PO intake
   .
   #. Acute on CKI:  The patient presented with Cr of 1.6, with baseline
   of 1.3.  Likely pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low CI);
   based on BUN/Cr ratio >20/1 and FeUn = 28.15%; Also with a history of
   intrinsic chronic renal disease as patient has long standing diabetes
   and hypertension.
   -          Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.
   -          Continue Lasix gtt as patient is fluid overloaded and
   # Swallow: Patient had swallow consult and they felt he would benefit
   from soft and thin diet.  Possible video swallow study on Monday.
   # Social Issues: Social work working on rehab for him

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2, presenting for medical management after a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has occluded saphenous vein grafts to the omohyoid muscles and one of the grafts appears to be acutely thrombosed. The patient is not a surgical or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) candidate and will be managed medically.

The patient's troponin levels have increased more than 20% from the previous day, indicating another infarct. He has not experienced chest pain in the past 24 hours, and his enzymes are trending down. He is currently stable, and his last troponin T level is 4.18.

The patient's vital signs include a blood pressure of 93/59 mmHg, heart rate of 58 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is on CPAP with an FiO2 of 35% and has a JVP of 18 cm.

His physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles at the lung bases, poor inspiratory effort, 1+ edema in both lower extremities, and soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated hemoglobin, elevated creatinine"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 68 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG
   in [**2158**], HTN, and DM2, who presented for medical management s/p NSTEMI.
   .
   #Left arm numbness: Unsure of etiology; Neurological vs. Cardiac vs.
   musculoskeletal;
   -          Neuro: no focal deficits found, but cannot exclude TIA; gave
   [**Year (4 digits) 119**] early and will continue to monitor
                              Also, patient slep with CPAP overnight and
   may have impinged a nerve as distribution was felt to be
                              dermatomal in origin
   -          Cardiac: Atypical presentation for ACS; 2 [**Year (4 digits) 7825**] helped his
   nausea, but not his arm numbness; ekg unchanged and cardiac enzymes
   pending;
   -          Will continue to monitor
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed..  Had a troponin increase of more than 20%
   Friday, and likely had another infarct. Currently, has not had an
   episode of chest pain in the past 24 hours. Now with left arm
   numbness/pain
   - Will Start Lasix 60mg PO Daily.
   - Will hold ACE-I  as patient has Acute on Chronic KD
   - Continue carvedilol in favor of metoprolol 12.5mg TID in order to
   increase BP
   - Continue Indur today.
   - Continue Digoxin 0.125mg po daily
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Pravastatin 40 mg daily -> continue to monitor for adverse
   reactions of leg pain, increased CK
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Pump:  The patient is slightly fluid overloaded with some improvement
   of his LE edema has improved as well as JVD, but continues to have
   crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely secondary to pulmonary
   edema.  His EF was 15-20% on recent TTE, and he likely needs continued
   diuresis to reduce preload.
   - Start Lasix 60mg PO Daily.
    - Will continue to diurese, with goal of net to -500cc.
   - continue digoxin, metoprolol as above
   -  Continue fluid restriction
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10
   beats.  This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. Patient remains
   asymptomatic. Continues to have sinus rhythm with pvcs.
   -          Continue to monitor on tele.
   -          Replete K this AM
   .
   # ANTICOAGULATION: Patient with apical hypokinesis and at risk for
   blood pooling and clot formation. Since patient has had akinesis
   recorded on echo in [**2158**], will not anticoagulate at this time as
   patient is at lower risk in the chronic state.
   -          Hold for now
   -          Guaiac stools next bowel movement
   #DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine
   (65U), Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration
    - Monitor BS and continue glargine 25 units for now. If BS is well
   above 250 throughout the day consider increasing the glargine dose to
   30 units qhs
    - FSBG and HISS
    - Encourage PO intake
   .
   #. Acute on CKI:  Cr of 1.7 this AM, with baseline of 1.3.  Likely
   pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low CI); based on BUN/Cr
   ratio >20/1 and FeUn = 28.15%; Also with a history of intrinsic chronic
   renal disease as patient has long standing diabetes and hypertension.
   Today improved Cr from 47/2.0 -> 43/1.7 likely secondary to diuresis
   -          Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.
   -          Start Lasix 60mg PO Daily.
   # Dysphagia: Patient noted to be choking on food; concern for dysphagia
   and aspiration
     -      Patient had swallow consult and they felt he would benefit
   from soft and thin diet.  Possible video swallow study on Monday.
   # Social Issues: Social work working on rehab for him

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented for medical management following a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient's current condition includes left arm numbness and coldness with nausea, which were given two tablets early. The EKG shows ST depression in II, III, AvF, and V4-V6, indicating possible ischemia. The patient used CPAP overnight due to desaturation and apnea episodes but tolerated it well.

His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/66-74/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is slightly fluid overloaded, as evidenced by crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely secondary to pulmonary edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin T levels. Renal function tests indicate a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. 

The assessment and plan include several components. Firstly, the patient's left arm numbness remains unclear in etiology, with possible causes including neurological, cardiac, or musculoskeletal"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 68 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG
   in [**2158**], HTN, and DM2, who presented for medical management s/p NSTEMI.
   .
   #Left arm numbness: Unsure of etiology; Neurological vs. Cardiac vs.
   musculoskeletal;
   -          Neuro: no focal deficits found, but cannot exclude TIA; gave
   [**Year (4 digits) 119**] early and will continue to monitor
                              Also, patient slep with CPAP overnight and
   may have impinged a nerve as distribution was felt to be
                              dermatomal in origin
   -          Cardiac: Atypical presentation for ACS; 2 [**Year (4 digits) 7825**] helped his
   nausea, but not his arm numbness; ekg unchanged and cardiac enzymes
   pending;
   -          Will continue to monitor
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed..  Had a troponin increase of more than 20%
   Friday, and likely had another infarct. Currently, has not had an
   episode of chest pain in the past 24 hours. Now with left arm
   numbness/pain
   - Will Start Lasix 60mg PO Daily.
   - Will hold ACE-I  as patient has Acute on Chronic KD
   - Continue carvedilol in favor of metoprolol 12.5mg TID in order to
   increase BP
   - Continue Indur today.
   - Continue Digoxin 0.125mg po daily
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Pravastatin 40 mg daily -> continue to monitor for adverse
   reactions of leg pain, increased CK
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Pump:  The patient is slightly fluid overloaded with some improvement
   of his LE edema has improved as well as JVD, but continues to have
   crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely secondary to pulmonary
   edema.  His EF was 15-20% on recent TTE, and he likely needs continued
   diuresis to reduce preload.
   - Start Lasix 60mg PO Daily.
    - Will continue to diurese, with goal of net to -500cc.
   - continue digoxin, metoprolol as above
   -  Continue fluid restriction
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10
   beats.  This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. Patient remains
   asymptomatic. Continues to have sinus rhythm with pvcs.
   -          Continue to monitor on tele.
   -          Replete K this AM
   .
   # ANTICOAGULATION: Patient with apical hypokinesis and at risk for
   blood pooling and clot formation. Since patient has had akinesis
   recorded on echo in [**2158**], will not anticoagulate at this time as
   patient is at lower risk in the chronic state.
   -          Hold for now
   -          Guaiac stools next bowel movement
   #DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine
   (65U), Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration
    - Monitor BS and continue glargine 25 units for now. If BS is well
   above 250 throughout the day consider increasing the glargine dose to
   30 units qhs
    - FSBG and HISS
    - Encourage PO intake
   .
   #. Acute on CKI:  Cr of 1.7 this AM, with baseline of 1.3.  Likely
   pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low CI); based on BUN/Cr
   ratio >20/1 and FeUn = 28.15%; Also with a history of intrinsic chronic
   renal disease as patient has long standing diabetes and hypertension.
   Today improved Cr from 47/2.0 -> 43/1.7 likely secondary to diuresis
   -          Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.
   -          Start Lasix 60mg PO Daily.
   # Dysphagia: Patient noted to be choking on food; concern for dysphagia
   and aspiration
     -      Patient had swallow consult and they felt he would benefit
   from soft and thin diet.  Possible video swallow study on Monday.
   # Social Issues: Social work working on rehab for him

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presented for medical management after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2018. Currently, he is in the ICU for optimal medical management due to occluded saphenous vein grafts to the omohyoid muscles and one acutely thrombosed graft.

The patient has been experiencing left arm numbness and coldness with nausea. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST depressions in leads II, III, AVF, and V2-V4. Troponin levels increased by more than 20% on Friday, indicating another possible infarct. The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated throughout the day. He also presented with dysphagia, and a swallow consult recommended a soft and thin diet with a possible video swallow study on Monday.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/66 mmHg to 74/23 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological examination revealed no focal deficits, but there was some weakness in the left hand squeeze."

                              Also, patient slep with CPAP overnight and
   may have impinged a nerve as distribution was felt to be
                              dermatomal in origin
   -          Cardiac: Atypical presentation for ACS; 2 [**Year (4 digits) 7825**] helped his
   nausea, but not his arm numbness; ekg unchanged and cardiac enzymes
   pending;
   -          Will continue to monitor
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with a 12 hour
   history of chest pain, elevated CEs, ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
   and V2-V4.  He was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and one
   of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  The patient is not a
   surgical or PCI candidate, and thus it was determined that he will be
   optimally medically managed..  Had a troponin increase of more than 20%
   Friday, and likely had another infarct. Currently, has not had an
   episode of chest pain in the past 24 hours. Now with left arm
   numbness/pain
   - Will continue to diurese with Lasix gtt
 Will transition to Lasix
   bolus as patient appears to be less fluid overloaded today
   - Will hold ACE-I  as patient has Acute on Chronic KD
   - Continue carvedilol in favor of metoprolol 12.5mg TID in order to
   increase BP
   - Continue Isordil 10mg po tid to improve collateral flow in his
   coronaries
   - Continue Digoxin 0.125mg po daily
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Pravastatin 40 mg daily -> continue to monitor for adverse
   reactions of leg pain, increased CK
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Pump:  The patient is slightly fluid overloaded with some improvement
   of his LE edema has improved as well as JVD, but continues to have
   crackles on physical exam and a cough, likely secondary to pulmonary
   edema.  His EF was 15-20% on recent TTE, and he likely needs continued
   diuresis to reduce preload.
    - Will continue to diurese as above
   - continue digoxin, metoprolol as above
   -  Continue fluid restriction
    - Continue to monitor UOP and Cr
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in NSR; however, he has had runs of
   NSVT since admission to the CCU, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10
   beats.  This is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. Patient remains
   asymptomatic. Continues to have sinus rhythm with pvcs.
   -          Continue to monitor on tele.
   -          Replete K this AM
   .
   # ANTICOAGULATION: Patient with apical hypokinesis and at risk for
   blood pooling and clot formation. Since patient has had akinesis
   recorded on echo in [**2158**], will not anticoagulate at this time as
   patient is at lower risk in the chronic state.
   -          Hold for now
   -          Guaiac stools next bowel movement
   #DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which he takes Glargine
   (65U), Metformin, Glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home.
    - Hold Metformin and Glyburide in the setting of recent contrast
   administration
    - Monitor BS and continue glargine 25 units for now. If BS is well
   above 250 throughout the day consider increasing the glargine dose to
   30 units qhs
    - FSBG and HISS
    - Encourage PO intake
   .
   #. Acute on CKI:  Cr of 1.7 this AM, with baseline of 1.3.  Likely
   pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low CI); based on BUN/Cr
   ratio >20/1 and FeUn = 28.15%; Also with a history of intrinsic chronic
   renal disease as patient has long standing diabetes and hypertension.
   Today improved Cr from 47/2.0 -> 43/1.7 likely secondary to diuresis
   -          Continue to monitor Cr and UOP with diuresis.
   -          Lasix gtt delivered approximately 160 mg lasix; consider 80
   mg PO BID
   # Dysphagia: Patient noted to be choking on food; concern for dysphagia
   and aspiration
     -      Patient had swallow consult and they felt he would benefit
   from soft and thin diet.  Possible video swallow study on Monday.
   # Social Issues: Social work working on rehab for him

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented for medical management after experiencing a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient's current condition includes left arm numbness and coldness with nausea, which may be due to neurological, cardiac, or musculoskeletal causes. The EKG showed ST depressions in II, III, AvF, and V4-V6, but the cardiac enzymes were not significantly elevated. 

The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 15-20% on recent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), indicating reduced cardiac function. He is slightly fluid overloaded but has shown some improvement in his lower extremity edema and jugular venous distention (JVD). Crackles on physical examination and cough are likely secondary to pulmonary edema. 

The patient has had runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) since admission to the critical care unit (CCU), but remains asymptomatic. His rhythm is currently sinus with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). 

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, likely due to pre-renal azotemia secondary to poor forward flow with"
