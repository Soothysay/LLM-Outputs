   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 67 yo M w/ vague past medical hx who
   presented to the ED and was found to have acute kidney injury,
   hyperkalemia, and anemia, of unclear etiology.
   .
   #acute kidney injury: Given hx of chronic fatigue over last few months,
   anemia, and Pt's relative stability in context of highly elevated
   BUN/Creatinine, suspect that Pt'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] likely represents acute worsening
   of chronic renal insufficiency, rather than a completely new acute
   event. Acute causes of creatinine elevation to this degree would
   include sepsis, hypovolemic shock, renal infarct, TTP-HUS, none of
   which appear consistent w/ the Pt's presentation.  If Pt has chronic
   renal insufficiency, possible etiologies could be obstruction, likely
   from benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
   renal artery stenosis. Other potential causes for Pt's acute kidney
   injury which will be evaluated include multiple myeloma, goodpasture's
   syndrome.
   - Renal u/s to eval for hydronephrosis w/ doppler studies to eval for
   renal artery stenosis
   - Urine lytes, UPEP
   - Serum [**Doctor First Name **], anti-GBM, ASO, CK, complement, Hgb A1C
   - Will d/c Vancomycin and Zosyn as no evidence of acute infectious
   process
   - Renal consult
   - Pt to IR for placement of temporary dialysis line and plan for
   dialysis for Saturday. Will make NPO after midnight.
   .
   #Hyperkalemia
   - Will recheck K on floor
   - Kayexelate PRN
   - Plan for HD on Saturday
   - Serial EKGs
   .
   # Anemia: Most likely chronic and related to suspected chronic renal
   failure, especially considering Pt's hx of medication to increase blood
   counts. However, given Pt's age, tobacco hx, and lack of access to
   routine medical care, other causes of anemia must be ruled out,
   particularly malignancy
   - SPEP, guiac all stools, iron studies, check smear, retic count
   - hemolysis labs sent
 initial results show no indication of hemolysis
   - Pt will need age appropriate cancer screening as outpatient, or as
   inpatient if medically unstable
   - will send PSA
   .
   #Hypocalcemia: Likely related to acute renal failure
   - Will replete calcium PRN
   .
   # Abdominal distention: Pt's abdomen notably distended although
   non-tender
   - F/u LFTs
   - Can consider CT scan of abdomen as inpt if clinically warranted

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a vague medical history who presented to the emergency department with acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, and anemia of unclear etiology. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient appears well-nourished and shows no signs of acute distress. Physical examination reveals normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin without rashes or lesions. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury with elevated BUN and creatinine levels, as well as hyperkalemia and anemia. Other lab values are within normal limits. The assessment and plan include further evaluation for potential causes of acute kidney injury, such as obstruction due to benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or renal artery stenosis. Additional tests and consultations have been ordered to investigate these possibilities. The patient will undergo dialysis on Saturday and will have a temporary dialysis line placed by interventional radiology. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute worsening of chronic renal insufficiency.
2. Chronic renal insufficiency itself may"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 9842**] presents with acute on CRF given his history of worsening
   malaise and fatigue since the last 2 months. He had left sided
   hydronephrosis on renal USG today and has clear copious urine from his
   foley catheter. His Hct is 19.7 but there is no eveidence for active
   blood loss. There is no uremic rub on exam
   He will need HD in the next 24 hours and workup for renal failure (
   possibly biopsy later this week). We will plan on transferring out of
   ICU today if there is no hemodynamic setback. PSA will also be checked
   and urology input may be useful if hydronephrosis resolves with foley
   decompression

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 67 yo M w/ vague past medical hx who
   presented to the ED and was found to have acute kidney injury,
   hyperkalemia, and anemia, of unclear etiology.
   #acute kidney injury: Given hx of chronic fatigue over last few months,
   anemia, and Pt's relative stability in context of highly elevated
   BUN/Creatinine, suspect that Pt'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] likely represents acute worsening
   of chronic renal insufficiency, rather than a completely new acute
   event. Acute causes of creatinine elevation to this degree would
   include sepsis, hypovolemic shock, renal infarct, TTP-HUS, none of
   which appear consistent w/ the Pt's presentation.  If Pt has chronic
   renal insufficiency, possible etiologies could be obstruction, likely
   from benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
   renal artery stenosis. Other potential causes for Pt's acute kidney
   injury which will be evaluated include multiple myeloma, goodpasture's
   syndrome.
   - Renal u/s to eval for hydronephrosis w/ doppler studies to eval for
   renal artery stenosis
   - Urine lytes, UPEP
   - Serum [**Doctor First Name **], anti-GBM, ASO, CK, complement, Hgb A1C
   - Will d/c Vancomycin and Zosyn as no evidence of acute infectious
   process
   - Renal consult
   - Pt to IR for placement of temporary dialysis line and plan for
   dialysis for Saturday. Will make NPO after midnight.
   .
   #Hyperkalemia
   - Will recheck K on floor
   - Kayexelate PRN
   - Plan for HD on Saturday
   - Serial EKGs
   .
   # Anemia: Most likely chronic and related to suspected chronic renal
   failure, especially considering Pt's hx of medication to increase blood
   counts. However, given Pt's age, tobacco hx, and lack of access to
   routine medical care, other causes of anemia must be ruled out,
   particularly malignancy
   - SPEP, guiac all stools, iron studies, check smear, retic count,
   hemolysis labs
   - Pt will need age appropriate cancer screening as outpatient, or as
   inpatient if medically unstable
   .
   #Hypocalcemia: Likely related to acute renal failure
   - Will replete calcium PRN
   .
   # Abdominal distention: Pt's abdomen notably distended although
   non-tender
   - F/u LFTs
   - Can consider CT scan of abdomen as inpt if clinically warranted

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with acute on chronic renal failure.
- He presented to the emergency department with vague medical history, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, and anemia of unclear etiology.
- The patient's current vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings, and no peripheral edema.
- Lab results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. Other lab results are within normal limits.
- Assessment and plan include the following:
   - Suspected acute worsening of chronic renal insufficiency rather than a new acute event.
   - Renal ultrasound to evaluate for hydronephrosis and Doppler studies to evaluate for renal artery stenosis.
   - Urine analysis for electrolytes and urine protein/creatinine ratio.
   - Serum tests including [doctor's name], anti-GBM, ASO, CK, complement, and Hgb A1C.
   - Discontinuation of Vancomycin and Zosyn as there is no evidence of an acute infectious process.
   - Renal consult, placement of a temporary dialysis line, and plan for dialysis on Saturday.
   - Rechecking potassium levels, Kayexelate administration for hyperkalemia, and serial EKGs.
   - Evaluation for other causes of anemia, including malignancy, through SPEP, guiac all stools, iron studies, check smear, retic count, and hemolysis labs.
   - Age-appropriate cancer screening as an outpatient or inpatient if medically unstable.
   - Repletion of calcium for hypocalcemia.
   - Further evaluation of abdominal distention with follow-up liver function tests and consideration of a CT scan of the abdomen if clinically warranted.
   - Nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and access information are also mentioned.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to worsening of chronic renal insufficiency.
2. Hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Anemia, which can cause fatigue and shortness of breath.
4. Hypocalcemia, which can result in muscle cramps, tetany, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Abdominal distention, which could be a sign of an underlying abdominal condition such as bowel obstruction or ascites.
6. Possible complications related to malignancy, considering the patient's age and tobacco history."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 9842**] is ready for transfer to the floor today and will initiate
   HD this weekend. He has been hemodynamicaly stable with adequate urine
   output. The workup for his CRF will continue as an outpatient and
   hopefully his HCT will respond too as renal function improves

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic fatigue, anemia, and acute kidney injury. The patient presented to the emergency department with hyperkalemia and anemia of unclear etiology. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and normal heart sounds with no murmurs or extra heart sounds. 

Laboratory results show elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. Other lab results include leukocytosis, anemia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's coagulation profile is within normal limits.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient likely represents acute worsening of chronic renal insufficiency rather than a completely new acute event. The possible etiologies of the patient's chronic renal insufficiency could include obstruction due to benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or renal artery stenosis. 

The patient's anemia is likely chronic and related to suspected chronic renal failure. However, other causes of anemia must be ruled out, particularly malignancy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 67 yo M w/ vague past medical hx who
   presented to the ED and was found to have acute kidney injury,
   hyperkalemia, and anemia, of unclear etiology.
   .
   #acute kidney injury: Given hx of chronic fatigue over last few months,
   anemia, and Pt's relative stability in context of highly elevated
   BUN/Creatinine, suspect that Pt'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] likely represents acute worsening
   of chronic renal insufficiency, rather than a completely new acute
   event. Acute causes of creatinine elevation to this degree would
   include sepsis, hypovolemic shock, renal infarct, TTP-HUS, none of
   which appear consistent w/ the Pt's presentation.  If Pt has chronic
   renal insufficiency, possible etiologies could be obstruction, likely
   from benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
   renal artery stenosis. Other potential causes for Pt's acute kidney
   injury which will be evaluated include multiple myeloma, goodpasture's
   syndrome.
   - f/u renal recs
   - f/u studies including UPEP, anti-GBM, CK
   - temporary dialysis line placed
 per renal, will get HD today
   -consider repeat renal ultrasound to evaluate for resolution of
   hydronephrosis
   .
   #Hyperkalemia
   - Will recheck K on floor
   - Kayexelate PRN
   - Plan for HD on Saturday
   - Serial EKGs
   .
   # Anemia: Most likely chronic and related to suspected chronic renal
   failure, especially considering Pt's hx of medication to increase blood
   counts. However, given Pt's age, tobacco hx, and lack of access to
   routine medical care, other causes of anemia must be ruled out,
   particularly malignancy
   - SPEP, guiac all stools, iron studies, check smear, retic count,
   hemolysis labs
   - Pt will need age appropriate cancer screening as outpatient, or as
   inpatient if medically unstable
   - will transfuse patient 1 unit today
   .
   #Hypocalcemia: Likely related to acute renal failure
   - Will replete calcium PRN
   .
   # Abdominal distention: Pt's abdomen notably distended although
   non-tender
   - F/u LFTs
   - Can consider CT scan of abdomen as inpt if clinically warranted

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute on chronic renal failure. He is experiencing nausea and headache with one episode of yellow emesis, for which he was given Zofran and Tylenol. The patient has no known drug allergies. His last dose of antibiotics was on [date]. He is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,927 mL, including 929 mL of IV fluids. Output includes 1,770 mL of urine, 200 mL of NG output, and 957 mL of drain output. The patient has received a total of 1,970 mL of blood products and has had 1,150 mL of urine output.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. His cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or irregularities. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds and symmetric chest expansion. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. There is no peripheral edema or rash noted. Neurological examination is not assessed due to language barrier.
