","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented to the emergency room with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and witnessed aspiration during intubation.

The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She has a central line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line in place.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 6.9 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 130 mEq/L, and hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.7 mg/dL. Her blood glucose level is within normal range at 120 mg/dL.

The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, nausea, and vomiting. She has a known large hiatal hernia and her differential diagnosis includes viral syndrome, gastric outlet obstruction, or nausea related to the primary pulmonary process. She also has metabolic alkalosis, likely secondary to vomiting and dehydration.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, related to her pneumonia, aspiration, and possibly mucous plugging acutely. She"

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old female with grade III
   infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast, hypertension and
   obstructive sleep apnea who presented to the emergency room with
   nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration and witnessed
   aspiration during intubation.
   .
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient with respiratory failure in the
   setting of nausea, vomiting, leukocytosis and likely aspiration
   pneumonia on CXR.  Hypoxia despite non-rebreather on the floor.
   Patient required intubation and is now satting well on the ventilator.
   Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear and likely multifactorial
   realted to her pneumonia, aspiration and possibly mucous plugging
   acutely.  Patient has known large hiatal hernia that may be her
   etiology of aspiration.
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - levofloxacin and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia
   - NPO, OGT to suction for now
   - maximize metabolic abnormalities to improve metabolic alkalosis and
   hypokalemia
   - Wean vent and extubate if RSBI less than 100
   .
   Hypotension: Transient in the setting of initiating sedation with
   likely vasodilatory effects.  Now improved with normal saline and
   transient peripheral dopamine.  Was on levophed which was turned off
   0300 [**12-6**]
   - NS fluid boluses for UOP < 50 cc/hr, MAP < 65
   - holding all blood antihypertensives
   .
   Nausea/Vomiting: Patient with known large hiatal hernia.  Unclear
   etiology of these symptoms.  Differential diagnosis includes viral
   syndrome, gastric outlet obstruction, or nausea related to primary
   pulmonary process.  KUB this morning with no evidence of free air,
   dilated bowel loops.  Contrast seen in the colon from prior CT scan.
   - OGT in place to suction
   - Once extubated will hold off on on NG tube unless clinically
   indicated
   - consider gastroenterology consult
   .
   Metabolic Alkalosis:  Likely secondary to vomiting and subsequent
   dehydration.
   - as above, received 2 L NS on arrival
   .
   Leukocytosis:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs.
   pneumonitis. Blood cultures from admission negative.
   - repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - levofloxacin and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia
   .
   Hypokalemia:  Likely secondary to vomiting but per notes concern that
   may be chronic.
   - IV repletion throughout the day
   .
   Hypertension: Transient hypotensive in the setting of intubation.
   - holding all antihypertensives
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease: No echocardiograms in our system.  Has q waves
   inferiorly.  No symptoms of angina, PND or orthopnea on admission H+P.
   Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - holding aspirin given guaiac positive emesis and NPO
   - holding statin
   .
   Breast cancer: Currently in remission.
   - holding arimidex while NPO
   .

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented to the emergency room with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient required intubation and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has a known large hiatal hernia, which may be the cause of her aspiration. The patient's hypoxia has improved with supplemental oxygen. She is being treated with levofloxacin and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia. The plan is to wean off the ventilator and consider extubation if the respiratory system resistance and compliance index (RSBI) is less than 100. The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to her large hiatal hernia, viral syndrome, gastric outlet obstruction, or a primary pulmonary process. Metabolic alkalosis is likely secondary to vomiting and dehydration. Leukocytosis could be due to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. Hypokalemia may be chronic or secondary to vomiting. Hypotension was initially transient but has improved with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, and a history of hiatal hernia. She presented with respiratory failure secondary to presumed aspiration. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/77 mmHg to 105/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

The patient's physical examination shows that she is awake and alert, with chest crepitations bilaterally. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, as well as her peripheral vascular examination. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities are warm with good pulses. Neurologically, she has no focal neuro findings.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 177 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 91 to 120 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including sodium of 130 mEq/L, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, and chloride of 98 mEq/L.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and nausea/vomiting. The plan is to extubate the patient, continue antibiotic coverage, monitor for hypotension, and re-evaluate the hiatal hernia/nausea/vomiting after extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, atelectasis, stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and nosocomial infections."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female who presented with nausea and vomiting. The note details various events, medications, vital signs, and lab results. 

The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone multiple procedures including the insertion of an arterial line and multi-lumen catheter. There was also a slight hematoma at the insertion site of the multi-lumen catheter.

The patient's respiratory status improved with the use of mechanical ventilation. She has been receiving antibiotics (levofloxacin and metronidazole) and other ICU medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. However, there was an episode of hypotension requiring levophed but is now off again.

The lab results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a slight respiratory alkalosis with compensated metabolic acidosis.

The assessment and plan include acute respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and nausea/vomiting. The respiratory failure is being managed with plans for extubation and continued antibiotic coverage. The hypotension is being monitored and anti-hypertensives are being held.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated at 1400 hours. After extubation, the patient had an aspiration event, leading to the decision of making the patient NPO (nothing by mouth) and requesting a swallow consult. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 162/79 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP. The patient has mild left hand swelling but has good pulses and is non-tender. The patient is still mildly hypoxic and is being treated with 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and decannulated. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,572 mL and output of 1,173 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 152 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and low potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old female with grade III
   infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast, hypertension and
   obstructive sleep apnea who presented to the emergency room with
   nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration and witnessed
   aspiration during intubation. S/p Extubation [**12-6**].
   .
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration: Patient with respiratory
   failure in the setting of nausea, vomiting, leukocytosis and likely
   aspiration pneumonia on CXR.  Hypoxia despite non-rebreather on the
   floor.  Patient required intubation and ventilation x 1day and is now
   extubated.  Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear and likely
   multifactorial realted to her pneumonia, aspiration and possibly mucous
   plugging acutely.  Patient has known large hiatal hernia that may be
   her etiology of aspiration. Was advanced to clears last night, but had
   witnessed aspiration event and was thus made npo again.
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - levofloxacin and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia
   - NPO
   - S and S eval requested
   .
   Hypotension: Transient in the setting of initiating sedation with
   likely vasodilatory effects.  Now improved with normal saline and
   transient peripheral dopamine.  Was on levophed which was turned off
   0300 [**12-6**]
   - NS fluid boluses for UOP < 50 cc/hr, MAP < 65
   - holding all blood antihypertensives
   .
   Nausea/Vomiting: Patient with known large hiatal hernia.  Unclear
   etiology of these symptoms.  Differential diagnosis includes viral
   syndrome, gastric outlet obstruction, or nausea related to primary
   pulmonary process.  KUB this morning with no evidence of free air,
   dilated bowel loops.  Contrast seen in the colon from prior CT scan.
   - gastroenterology consult
   - change antiemetics to prn
   .
   Metabolic Alkalosis:  Likely secondary to vomiting and subsequent
   dehydration.
   - as above, received 2 L NS on arrival
   .
   Leukocytosis:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs.
   pneumonitis. Blood cultures from admission negative.
   - repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - levofloxacin and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia
   .
   Hypokalemia:  Likely secondary to vomiting but per notes concern that
   may be chronic.
   - IV repletion throughout the day
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease: No echocardiograms in our system.  Has q waves
   inferiorly.  No symptoms of angina, PND or orthopnea on admission H+P.
   Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - holding aspirin given guaiac positive emesis and NPO
   - holding statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient was extubated and advanced to clear fluids, but experienced an aspiration event, leading to the decision of making the patient NPO (nothing by mouth) and requesting a swallow consult.
- The patient's blood gases improved after extubation, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 164.
- The patient was noted to have left hand swelling, good pulses, and non-tender.
- The patient was mildly hypoxic while on CPAP and had crackles on examination.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 71-88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110-163 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%.
- The patient's weight is currently 60 kg, with a change from admission weight of 56.5 kg.
- The patient received a total of 3,572 mL of fluids, including 205 mL of blood products, and had a total output of 1,173 mL.
- The patient's respiratory support includes being on a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 98% and ABG results showing a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 164.
- The patient's physical examination revealed clear lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, and edematous left hand.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count of 15.2 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, elevated blood glucose of 101 mg/dL, and abnormal electrolyte levels including sodium of 28 mEq/L, potassium of 0.6 mg/dL, chloride of 101 mg/dL, and magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL.
- Radiology images are included.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, electrolyte and fluid disorder, nausea/vomiting, and has various lines and probes in place for monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen due to aspiration events or inadequate oxygenation.
2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The abnormal electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium, indicate a potential electrolyte imbalance that needs correction to maintain proper bodily functions.
3. Nausea/vomiting: The patient's ongoing nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and potential aspiration pneumonia if not managed appropriately.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection, which needs to be further evaluated and treated if necessary.
5. Fluid overload: The significant fluid intake compared to output may indicate fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
6. Edema: The patient's left hand edema could be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old female with grade III
   infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast, hypertension and
   obstructive sleep apnea who presented to the emergency room with
   nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration and witnessed
   aspiration during intubation. S/p Extubation [**12-6**].
   .
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration: Patient with respiratory
   failure in the setting of nausea, vomiting, leukocytosis and likely
   aspiration pneumonia on CXR.  Hypoxia despite non-rebreather on the
   floor.  Patient required intubation and ventilation x 1day and is now
   extubated.  Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear and likely
   multifactorial realted to her pneumonia, aspiration and possibly mucous
   plugging acutely.  Patient has known large hiatal hernia that may be
   her etiology of aspiration. Was advanced to clears last night, but had
   witnessed aspiration event and was thus made npo again.
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - levofloxacin and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia
   - NPO
   - S and S eval requested
   .
   Hypotension: Transient in the setting of initiating sedation with
   likely vasodilatory effects.  Now improved with normal saline and
   transient peripheral dopamine.  Was on levophed which was turned off
   0300 [**12-6**]
   - NS fluid boluses for UOP < 50 cc/hr, MAP < 65
   - holding all blood antihypertensives
   .
   Nausea/Vomiting: Patient with known large hiatal hernia.  Unclear
   etiology of these symptoms.  Differential diagnosis includes viral
   syndrome, gastric outlet obstruction, or nausea related to primary
   pulmonary process.  KUB this morning with no evidence of free air,
   dilated bowel loops.  Contrast seen in the colon from prior CT scan.
   - OGT in place to suction
   - Once extubated will hold off on on NG tube unless clinically
   indicated
   - consider gastroenterology consult
   .
   Metabolic Alkalosis:  Likely secondary to vomiting and subsequent
   dehydration.
   - as above, received 2 L NS on arrival
   .
   Leukocytosis:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs.
   pneumonitis. Blood cultures from admission negative.
   - repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - levofloxacin and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia
   .
   Hypokalemia:  Likely secondary to vomiting but per notes concern that
   may be chronic.
   - IV repletion throughout the day
   .
   Hypertension: Transient hypotensive in the setting of intubation.
   - holding all antihypertensives
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease: No echocardiograms in our system.  Has q waves
   inferiorly.  No symptoms of angina, PND or orthopnea on admission H+P.
   Cardiac enzymes negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration. She required intubation and ventilation but is now extubated. The patient has known large hiatal hernia, which may be the etiology of her aspiration. She was advanced to clears last night but had a witnessed aspiration event and was made NPO again.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia, possibly exacerbated by her known large hiatal hernia. She may continue to experience hypoxia and require supplemental oxygen.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis likely secondary to vomiting and subsequent dehydration. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances and should be monitored closely.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be secondary to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. Blood cultures from admission were negative, but repeat cultures are needed to monitor for any changes.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient has hypokalemia, likely secondary to vomiting. IV repletion throughout the day is recommended to correct this imbalance.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and proton pump inhibitors. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/69 mmHg to 143/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has shown improvement in their condition, as they are now tolerating advances in their diet.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially admitted with respiratory failure, and there is a risk of worsening or development of new respiratory issues while in the ICU.
2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient's labs show imbalances in sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and magnesium (Mg++). These imbalances can lead to various complications if not corrected.
3. Nausea/vomiting: The patient continues to experience nausea and vomiting, which may be related to the stress ulcer prophylaxis or other underlying conditions.
4. Infection: The presence of central line and Foley out, along with the urine culture pending, suggests the possibility of infection. This needs to be monitored closely.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on DVT prophyl"

The plan is to start home antihypertensives and PO medications when they go to the floor. An EGD and upper endoscopy have been scheduled for tomorrow, along with precautions to prevent aspiration. The central line and Foley catheter have been removed. Urine culture PND has been done.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/69 to 143/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. They are on nasal cannula for respiratory support.

Physical examination shows no abnormalities in the general or HEENT assessments. The cardiovascular examination reveals regular heart rhythm with no murmurs or bruits. The respiratory examination is clear, and the gastrointestinal examination shows soft, non-tender abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds. The gu examination reveals clear yellow urine drainage from the Foley catheter. The extremity examination shows edema in the left hand.

Laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, glucose, and other electrolytes. The creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.9 mg/dL. The platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR"

   extubated.  Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear and likely
   multifactorial realted to her pneumonia, aspiration and possibly mucous
   plugging acutely.  Patient has known large hiatal hernia that may be
   her etiology of aspiration. Was advanced to clears last night, but had
   witnessed aspiration event and was thus made npo again.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with grade III infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented to the emergency room with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration and witnessed aspiration during intubation. She has been extubated.

The patient has the following medical complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration: The patient required intubation and ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia, aspiration, and possibly mucous plugging acutely. She has a known large hiatal hernia that may be her etiology of aspiration. She was advanced to clears last night but had a witnessed aspiration event and was made NPO again. She will be weaned off oxygen as tolerated and will continue nectar-thick liquids. An EGD will be done as an outpatient, and she will follow up with GI recommendations.

2. Hypotension: The patient had transient hypotension in the setting of initiating sedation with likely vasodilatory effects. It improved with normal saline and transient peripheral dopamine. She was on levophed, which was turned off at 0300 on 12-6. She will receive NS fluid boluses for UOP < 50 cc/hr, MAP < 65, and all blood antihypertensives will be held.
