","The patient is a 53-year-old male who presented with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He was admitted to the hospital and received tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for acute ischemic stroke. The patient is now in the ICU with worsening aphasia, and a head CT scan has been ordered to rule out any bleeding post-TPA.

The patient's medical history includes alcohol abuse, and he is being treated with lorazepam as needed for possible withdrawal. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/70 to 165/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild confusion, worsening dysarthria, right facial droop, and tongue deviation to the right. Neurological examination shows absent right and left radial pulses, absent right distal pulses, and normal breath sounds with symmetric chest expansion. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and he has normal bowel sounds. The patient's skin is warm, and he has mild right facial droop with normal movement and tone.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 6.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, platelet count of 396 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of stroke and alcohol abuse, currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient presented with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He received tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) at another hospital and was transferred for further management. The patient is being treated for possible alcohol withdrawal with lorazepam (Ativan) as needed and is also receiving a ""banana bag"" treatment. His worsening aphasia prompted a head CT scan to rule out any bleeding post-TPA.

The patient's medical history includes known drug allergies, but they were not specified in the note. The last dose of antibiotics was not mentioned. The patient is receiving various ICU medications and other medications, but specific details were not provided.

Review of systems revealed no constitutional symptoms such as fatigue or fever, no chest pain, respiratory distress, abdominal pain, or numbness/tingling. However, the patient experienced mild confusion, dysarthria/worse aphasia, and right facial droop.

Flowsheet data showed stable vital signs with a temperature within normal range, heart rate slightly on the lower side, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 95%. Hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance were also within normal limits.

Physical examination revealed the patient to be well-nourished with normal eyes/conjunctiva, head/ears/nose/throat, cardiovascular assessment, peripheral vascular assessment, respiratory"
