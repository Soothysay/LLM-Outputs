","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, currently admitted to the ICU. They have been receiving various treatments and interventions, including the placement of a PICC line, administration of antibiotics (Cefazolin), heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and initiation of the CHOP regimen. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is positive for hypokalemia and lysis labs are being checked every 6 hours. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,610 mL and output of 1,065 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,545 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic status, and other physical examination findings are not assessed. Laboratory results indicate abnormalities in potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver enzymes. The patient's coagulation profile shows elevated PT/PTT/INR levels. Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with newly diagnosed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) involving the lung, pericardium, heart, adrenals, and kidneys. He is set to undergo chemotherapy. The patient also has significant hypercalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercalcemia: The patient has an elevated calcium level, which can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, renal dysfunction, and neurologic disturbances.

2. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion, for which he underwent a pericardial window procedure. There is a chest tube draining to water seal, and cardiac follow-up recommendations have been given.

3. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing tachycardia, which has been managed with Lopressor. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rate and blood pressure to ensure adequate hemodynamic stability.

4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored due to the ongoing IVF hydration with NS and the previous pericardial effusion. Fluid overload or dehydration can have various consequences on the patient's condition.

5. Chemotherapy: The patient is scheduled to undergo chemotherapy for his NHL. It is crucial to monitor for any potential side effects or complications associated with chemotherapy, such as myelosuppression, mucositis, and immunosuppression.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) involving the lung, pericardium, heart, adrenals, and kidneys. The patient is set to undergo chemotherapy and is currently experiencing significant hypercalcemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.2°C (97.1°F)
- Heart rate: 99 bpm (97-107 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 98/60 mmHg (68-109/44-53 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (12-20 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on nasal cannula

The patient has a pericardial effusion with a pericardial window drain noted anteriorly, serosanguinous fluid observed, and a pericardial friction rub auscultated.

Laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 31.0%
- White blood cell count: 13.7 thousand/mm3 (11.6-15.7 thousand/mm3)
- Platelet count: 195 thousand/mm3 (155-198 thousand/mm3)
- Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL (1.2-1.7 mg/dL)
- Blood glucose: 84 mg/dL (97-134 mg/dL)
- Calcium level: 14.0 mg/dL
- Magnesium level: 2.3 mg/dL
- Phosphate level: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes aggressive intravenous fluid hydration with normal saline, holding lasix until volume is repleted, receiving pamidronate, and continuing decadron 20mg IV bid for the next 24 hours.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the provided information include:
1. Pericardial effusion with potential cardiac tamponade.
2. Hypercalcemia, which may lead to renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological disturbances.
3. Potential infection due to the presence of a pericardial window drain and central venous catheter (PICC line).
4. Chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, leading to an increased risk of infection.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheter use.
6. Stress ulcers due to critical illness and steroid use.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to mechanical ventilation.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed accordingly to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) involving the lung, pericardium, heart, adrenals, and kidneys. He is set to undergo chemotherapy. The patient also has significant hypercalcemia, pericardial effusion, and tachycardia. He was admitted with hypokalemia, which has been repleted. Lysis labs are being checked every 6 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercalcemia: The patient's high calcium levels may lead to complications such as renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, neurologic symptoms, and bone pain.
2. Pericardial Effusion: The presence of fluid around the heart can potentially cause cardiac tamponade, leading to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may increase the risk of myocardial ischemia and infarction.
4. Chemotherapy Side Effects: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for NHL, which can cause various side effects including immunosuppression, mucositis, myelosuppression, and potential infections.
5. Hypokalemia: Although the patient's potassium levels have been repleted, there is still a risk of recurrent hypokalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient"

   dose of CHOP.  Remains encephalopathic and hypovolemic by exam.
   1)       Non-Hodgkin
 Status post CHOP.  Continue to follow tumor
   lysis labs.  Prednisone.
   2)      Hypovolemia
 Continue NS at 250 cc / hr plus boluses for UOP <
   40 cc / hr.
   3)      Hypercalcemia
 Likely secondary to metastatic disease and
   immobilization.  Aggressive IV hydration as above.  Holding lasix given
   low UOP, elevated creatinine.
   4)      Encephalopathy
 Likely secondary to hypernatremia,
   hypercalcemia.  Will try haldol rather than ativan for agitation as
   benzodiazepenes may contribute to ICU delirium.  Check ammonia.  No
   obvious signs of infection though WBC up to 21K after prednisone.
   Start thiamine, folate.  Check vitamin B12, folate levels.
   5)      ARF
 Stable and likely pre-renal in nature.  Hydration as
   above.
   6)      Pericardial effusion
 Drain remains in place.  Follow output.
   Cardiac surgery following.
   7)      Atrial tachycardia
 Lopressor with hold parameters given
   borderline BP.
   8)      Anemia
 Hct stable.  Vit B12, folate levels as above.
   9)      FEN
 NPO.  Maintenance fluids.  Follow lytes.
   I as physically present with the ICU fellow for presentation and
   discussion of the patient
s course.  I agree in full with the history,
   exam, ROS and plan of the above note of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  I would add
   Patient with initial Rx for NHL with CHOP and has persistent altered
   mental status with question raised as to possible CNS involvement.  He
   is now s/p pericardial window for drainage of effusion.
   Exam
patient with response to voice but only intermittently following
   commands.  He does move all extremities.  He has persistent rub
   appreciated anteriorly.
   Will continue to attempt to optimize lytes and look so see improvement
   in mental status.  If able
will pursue LP for evaluation of CNS
   involvment with NHL.  IVF to be changed to
 NS given hypernatremia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, complicated by hypercalcemia and pericardial effusion. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing concerns including hypovolemia, hypercalcemia, encephalopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), pericardial effusion, atrial tachycardia, anemia, and fluid electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient's underlying condition may progress or lead to further complications.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient is at risk of continued fluid loss and potential cardiovascular collapse.
3. Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, renal dysfunction, and neurologic complications.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, potentially leading to increased agitation or even coma.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Pre-renal causes of ARF should be managed promptly to prevent further kidney damage.
6. Pericardial Effusion: Continued accumulation of fluid around the heart can compromise cardiac function and necessitate surgical intervention.
7. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient's"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/63 to 111/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen. 

Physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, diminished breath sounds at the left base, and the presence of a pericardial drain. Neurologically, the patient is not assessed for orientation or movement, and his extremities show absent pulses on the right side and decreased pulses on the left side.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 13.7 to 21.3 thousand/mm³, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count ranging from 155 to 198 thousand/mm³, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated potassium levels. Other lab values include hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, and altered liver function tests.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who presented with pericardial effusion and altered mental status. He has hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, and hypovolemia, which are likely contributing to his encephalopathy. The patient underwent pericardial window drainage due to the effusion.

The patient's 24-hour events include improvement in hypernatremia with half-normal saline, ongoing improvement in hypercalcemia, unrevealing encephalopathy work-up, and agitation overnight requiring haloperidol.

The patient's medical history is significant for NHL, pericardial effusion, and hypercalcemia. Allergies include no known drug allergies. Current medications include allopurinol, CHOP chemotherapy, steroids, famotidine, heparin sodium, haloperidol, and solumedrol.

Physical examination findings include dry mucous membranes, diminished breath sounds at the left base, and a pericardial drain in place. Neurological examination shows that the patient is not assessed for movement, tone, or orientation.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 127 K/u"

The patient is a 60-year-old male diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) involving the lung, pericardium, heart, adrenals, and kidneys. He is scheduled to undergo chemotherapy and has also been dealing with significant hypercalcemia. The patient underwent an IR-guided PICC line placement, received chemotherapy as recommended by the BMT team, and had a pericardial window performed due to pericardial effusion. He also received pamidronate on 7/25 for hypercalcemia and continued with decadron 20mg IV bid for the next 24 hours before readdressing with the BMT team. The patient was experiencing tachycardia and was started on lopressor 12.5mg, with the dose lowered from previous due to low MAP. His diet is to be progressed to regular, and he will have EJ and PIVx1 access with plans for a PICC line in IR today. Additionally, he received pneumoboots and sq heparin until platelet drop, as well as H2 blockers given on steroids. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU."

   60 yom newly diagnosed lymphoma, now with encephalopathy
   ENCEPHALOPHATHY -- no improvement of encephalopathy with correction of
   metabolic disturbances.  Would perform LP to r/o CNS lymphoma (may
   require  intrathecal chemoRx)
   TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME -- no overt evidence.  Monitor.
   LYMPHOMA -- newly diagnosed this admission.  Completed chemotherapy
   (CHOP).  Continue prednisone
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- continues to drain (300 ml over past 24 hrs).
   Maintain drain, monitor output.
   Right Upper Extremity swelling -- concern for thrombosis related to
   PICC.
   ANEMIA -- anticipate further reduction with chemoRx.  Stable
   currently.  Monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with newly diagnosed lymphoma, currently experiencing encephalopathy and tumor lysis syndrome. He has a history of pericardial effusion, right upper extremity swelling, and anemia. The patient is receiving chemotherapy (CHOP) and is on prednisone. He is in the ICU for critical care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: This is a potential complication in patients undergoing chemotherapy, especially for lymphomas. It occurs when cancer cells release their contents into the bloodstream, leading to electrolyte imbalances and kidney damage. Monitoring and management of electrolyte levels and kidney function are crucial.

2. CNS Lymphoma: Encephalopathy that does not improve with correction of metabolic disturbances raises concern for CNS involvement of lymphoma. A lumbar puncture (LP) may be necessary to rule out CNS lymphoma and potentially require intrathecal chemotherapy.

3. Thrombosis: The right upper extremity swelling raises concern for thrombosis related to the PICC line. Monitoring for signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and considering anticoagulation prophylaxis may be necessary.

4. Anemia: Anticipated further reduction in hemoglobin levels due to chemotherapy. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and blood counts is essential to manage anemia.

5. Pericardial Effusion: Although the effusion is being drained, ongoing monitoring is required"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yom newly diagnosed lymphoma, now with encephalopathy
   ENCEPHALOPHATHY -- no improvement of encephalopathy with correction of
   metabolic disturbances.  Would perform LP to r/o CNS lymphoma (may
   require  intrathecal chemoRx)
   TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME -- no clinical evidence at this time.  Monitor
   blood testing serially.
   LYMPHOMA -- newly diagnosed this admission.  Completed chemotherapy
   (CHOP).  Continue prednisone
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- continues to drain (300 ml over past 24 hrs).
   Maintain drain, monitor output.
   Right Upper Extremity swelling -- concern for thrombosis related to
   PICC.  Check U/S to exclude DVT.
   ANEMIA -- anticipate further reduction with chemoRx.  Stable
   currently.  Monitor.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lymphoma and currently experiencing encephalopathy. The patient underwent chemotherapy (CHOP) and is being treated with prednisone.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: This is a condition that can occur after chemotherapy, particularly in patients with high tumor burden or rapidly proliferating tumors. It is characterized by the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream, leading to metabolic abnormalities such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and acute kidney injury.

2. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion that continues to drain. This could potentially lead to cardiac tamponade if the effusion increases in size, which can compromise cardiac output and lead to hemodynamic instability.

3. Thrombosis: The patient's right upper extremity swelling raises concern for thrombosis, possibly due to the peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line. If confirmed, this could lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, both of which can be life-threatening.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is anticipated to further reduce with chemotherapy. Anemia can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and tissue hypoxia.

5. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy has not improved despite correction of metabolic disturbances. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause, with consideration of CNS lymphoma and the possibility of performing a lumbar puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy if necessary.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and prompt management of these potential complications to prevent further deterioration."

1. Encephalopathy: The patient has persistent encephalopathy, which is a condition characterized by brain dysfunction. It can be caused by various factors such as infections, metabolic abnormalities, or drug toxicity. The patient's medications may be contributing to this condition.

2. Pain management: The patient has a pericardial drain in place, indicating a procedure that may cause pain. Optimal pain management is crucial to improve the patient's comfort.

3. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: The patient has a history of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This indicates an underlying malignancy, which can lead to various complications due to the disease itself or the treatment received.

4. Pericardial effusion: The patient has persistent pericardial effusion, which is an accumulation of fluid around the heart. This condition can lead to cardiac tamponade, compromising heart function and circulation.

5. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient has resolved tumor lysis syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs after the treatment of certain types of cancer. It is characterized by the rapid breakdown of tumor cells, leading to the release of their contents into the bloodstream and causing metabolic abnormalities.

6. Fluid balance: The patient is hypovolemic but trending towards euvolemia. Maint"

   Assessment and Plan
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- No significant improvement with correction of
   electrolyte disturbance.  Medications may be contributing.  Plan for LP
   to r/o CNS lymphoma --> may require intubation and sedation to allow
   LP.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- pericardial drain.  Optimize
   LYMPHOMA, non-Hodgkin's --  s/p chemo and XRT
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- windowdrain in place, maintain tube.
   Persistent.
   TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME -- resolved.  Continue allopurinol
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic but tranding towards euvolumic;  maintain balance
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- encourage PO, suppliments.
   RUE SWELLING -- check vascular U/S to assess for DVT
   ANEMIA -- likely due to chemoRx

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical conditions and potential complications. Here is a summary of the information:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient remains encephalopathic with variable improvement using medications such as ativan and haldol. The cause of encephalopathy is not identified, but medications may be contributing to it. A lumbar puncture (LP) is planned to rule out CNS lymphoma.

2. Pain Management: The patient is experiencing discomfort from the pericardial drain. Pain management strategies should be optimized.

3. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient has a history of chemotherapy and radiation treatment for lymphoma.

4. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a persistent pericardial effusion with a window drain in place. The drain needs to be maintained.

5. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient has resolved tumor lysis syndrome, but allopurinol should be continued.

6. Fluids: The patient is hypovolemic but trending towards euvolumic. Fluid balance should be maintained.

7. Nutritional Support: Encourage oral intake and provide nutritional supplements.

8. RUE Swelling: Check for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by performing a vascular ultrasound.

9. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia due to chemotherapy.

10. ICU Care: The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU"

   Assessment and Plan
   Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, persistent encephalopathy
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- persistent, no significant improvement with
   improvement of electrolyte and metabolic derrangements.  Concern
   remains for CNS involvement of lymphoma.  CSF cytology pending.
   Neurotoxicity of chemoRx?  Consider head MRI.  Consider EEG to r/o
   seizures and post-ictal state.  Consider Haldol, but need to check EKG
   (Qt interval).
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic.  Follow I/O.  Maintain balance.
   LYMPHOMA, non-HODGKIN""S -- s/p chemoRx.  Plan for reimaging of torso to
   assess adenopathy.  Will likely need intubation to allow procedures.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- s/p window, drain in place --> continues to
   drain substantially.  Pain control for pericardial drain --> morphine.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- PO, need to assess whether adequate intake.
   Assess adequacy for swallowing.  Would initiate NGT with TF.
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression s/p chemoRx.  Transfuse to >21.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, persistent encephalopathy, and a history of chemotherapy treatment. The patient remains encephalopathic with no significant improvement despite correction of electrolyte and metabolic imbalances. There are concerns about central nervous system involvement of lymphoma, with cerebrospinal fluid cytology pending. Neurotoxicity from chemotherapy is also being considered. The patient is euvolemic, and fluid balance is being maintained. Pain control for pericardial effusion and drain is provided with morphine. Nutritional support through oral intake is being assessed, and a nasogastric tube with total parenteral nutrition may be initiated. Anemia due to bone marrow suppression post-chemotherapy is present, and transfusion to a hemoglobin level greater than 21 g/dL is planned. The patient has a pericardial effusion that has been drained and continues to drain substantially. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Encephalopathy
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- improved.  Suspect toxic-metabolic, possibly related
   to chemoRx, metabolic derrangements and infection (PICC line)
   LYMPHOMA -- s/p chemotherapy.  For torso CT to assess adenopathy.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- s/p window.  Drain remains in place, still
   draining.
   ANEMIA -- related to chemoRx.  Acute drop in Hct yesterday represented
   lab error.  Monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- encourage PO as mental status improves.
   Continue TF (deficient).
   BACTEREMIA -- likely line-related infection (PICC).  PICC d/c'd.
   Empirical antibiotics pending culture results.
   RUE DVT -- likely related to PICC.  Line d/c'd, No anticoagulation in
   presence of bloody pericardial effusion.
   LLL INFILTRATE -- possible atalectasis or new infiltrate (aspiration
   risk).  Low threshold for empirical treatment for aspiration pneumonia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has a diagnosis of encephalopathy. The patient's symptoms include agitation and confusion. The patient's medical history includes lymphoma, for which they have undergone chemotherapy, and a pericardial effusion that required a window procedure. 

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, and a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 100% and the patient is not in acute distress.

The physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 122 K/uL. The platelet count is within normal range at 130 K/uL. Liver enzymes are slightly elevated, with AST and ALT levels at 10-8, and there is evidence of renal dysfunction with elevated creatinine levels. Electrolytes show mild imbalances, with hyponatremia (sodium 122 mEq/L) and hyperkalemia (potassium 4.6 mEq/L). 

The patient has multiple lines and tubes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of encephalopathy. The patient has a history of lymphoma and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. He also has a pericardial effusion with a drain in place, anemia related to chemotherapy, and likely line-related infections (PICC line). The patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeding due to his mental status and inability to eat by mouth. Blood cultures were obtained from the PICC line, and the line has been discontinued. Empirical antibiotics have been started pending culture results. The patient is at risk for aspiration pneumonia, so there is a low threshold for treatment. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to chemotherapy, making him more susceptible to infections. The presence of bacteremia and a likely line-related infection indicates a current risk.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, which is a potential complication in critically ill patients, especially those with prolonged immobility or central venous catheters.
4. Pulmonary embolism: A possible complication of DVT, especially if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving regular insulin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of lymphoma status post chemotherapy, presenting with encephalopathy. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is receiving various treatments including antibiotics (Vancomycin), anticoagulation (Heparin), and sedation (Haloperidol).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), blood pressure ranging from 136/74 to 162/84 mmHg, heart rate between 79-120 bpm, respiratory rate of 10-18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient has a pericardial effusion with ongoing drainage, likely secondary to his lymphoma. He also has a history of bacteremia related to a central line, which has resulted in the discontinuation of the PICC line and continuation of vancomycin.

The patient's laboratory values indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows improvement in the chest X-ray.

The patient's plan includes continued pharmacological control of encephalopathy, consideration for head MRI, assessment of lymphadenopathy with torso CT, maintenance of pericardial effusion drainage, nutritional support through PO and TF, and treatment for right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy. The patient has a history of lymphoma and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. He also has a pericardial effusion and is on a pericardial drain. The patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeds and is being monitored for DVT prophylaxis. There is a concern for line-related bacteremia, and the patient's PICC line has been discontinued. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 136/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination is notable for no acute distress, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's ongoing encephalopathy can lead to further cognitive decline and potential respiratory compromise.
2. Line-related bacteremia: The patient's current bacteremia may result in sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Pericardial effusion: The patient's pericardial effusion could lead to cardiac tamponade if the fluid accumulation worsens.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's risk of developing DVT due to immobility and indwelling lines should be closely monitored.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) involving the lung, pericardium, heart, adrenals, and kidneys. He is set to undergo chemotherapy and has also experienced significant hypercalcemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing encephalopathy despite correction of calcium levels. His head CT is negative for any bleeding, and other potential causes of encephalopathy include CNS lymphoma or an infectious cause. He is being managed with soft restraints and ativan for agitation and will undergo a lumbar puncture today to evaluate for cell count and workup of infectious/malignant causes.

The patient has completed the first cycle of CHOP therapy for NHL and is scheduled for additional chemotherapy as per the BMT team. He is also on DIC/TLS labs every 6 hours, allopurinol 300mg daily, and prednisone 100mg daily. The patient has right upper extremity swelling, which is being evaluated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with a lower extremity venous ultrasound. He has undergone a pericardial window due to pericardial effusion and is now on chest tube drainage to water seal. Cardiac follow-up recommendations have been provided.

The patient's hypercalcemia has been corrected, and lasix has been withheld. He received pamidronate on [**7"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) involving the lung, pericardium, heart, adrenals, and kidneys. He is scheduled to undergo chemotherapy. The patient also has significant hypercalcemia. 

The patient's current condition includes encephalopathy that continues despite correction of calcium levels, negative head CT for bleed, and other potential etiologies such as CNS lymphoma or infectious cause. The plan is to continue soft restraints and ativan PRN for agitation and perform a lumbar puncture today for cell count and workup of infectious/malignant cause of encephalopathy, premedicating with Versed.

Other plans include completing first TX of CHOP therapy on [**2126-7-26**], chemotherapy per BMT team, DIC/TLS labs q6h, allopurinol increased to 300mg daily, discontinuing IV fluids, and prednisone 100mg daily.

The patient has RUE swelling with right greater than left, and an upcoming LENI to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient previously had a pericardial effusion that underwent pericardial window and is now monitored with a chest tube draining to water seal. Follow-up cardiac recommendations are pending.

The patient's hypercalcemia has been corrected, lasix has been held, and he"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of lymphoma, who was admitted to the ICU due to encephalopathy. The patient underwent pericardial drain placement and had intrathecal methotrexate instilled into the CSF. The patient remains encephalopathic and is currently on antibiotics for Streptococcus viridens bacteremia. The patient also has a history of sepsis, pericardial effusion, and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 126/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has been placed on systemic anticoagulation. The patient's code status is full code, and the plan is to transfer him to the floor once his condition improves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CNS Lymphoma: The patient has a history of lymphoma, which can potentially lead to CNS involvement and further neurological complications.
2. Streptococcus viridens Bacteremia: The patient is currently on antibiotics for bacteremia caused by Streptococcus viridens. If the infection spreads or becomes resistant to the antibiotics, it can lead to severe complications.
