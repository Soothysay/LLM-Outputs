   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, toxins. Acute hearing loss makes viral etiology
   or intracranial microvascular event more likely.
   - Empiric treatment for meningitis in ED (received ctx, vanc,
   acyclovir, steroids on [**4-17**]); will stop antibacterials but continue
   acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending CSF HSV
   PCR results
   - LP performed in ED; results unconcerning for infection or
   inflammation; follow culture
   - Head CT: no acute process
   - Reassess mental status when no longer sedated
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking
   - Obtain brain MRI with contrast when renal function improved
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2.
   - Check K q6h until remains normal X 24 hours
   - Treat ARF as below
   .
   # TROPONIN LEAK: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but more
   likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST depressions
   when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, then decreased to
   0.92 by [**4-18**] morning.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight; will
   discontinue (and restart SCH for prophylaxis) after repeat cardiac labs
   this afternoon show continued decline in enzymes
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission
   - IVF (bolus to maintain BP > 120 systolic, UOP > 50 cc/hr); urine
   lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN 51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Repeat BUN/Cr in afternoon, follow-up urine sediment
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.
   - LP as above, follow up HSV PCR
   - Blood cx, CSF cx, sputum cx, urine cx (though UA benign)
   - CXR: follow up final read
   - Continue empiric acyclovir (day 1
 [**4-17**]) as above for possible
   encephalitis; continue levofloxacin (day 1
 [**4-17**]) empirically for
   possible community-acquired PNA given concerning CXR (no known risk
   factors for MRSA); course to be determined pending clinical course
   - Foilow up urine legionella
   .
   # TACHYPNEA. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in setting of
   agitation/change in mental status. Pt now on PSV 5/5 FiO2 50%.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation this morning
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - Follow up TSH
   - MRI with contrast when possible
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving
   - IV fluids
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # Elevated coags/LFTs. Unclear etiology, will recheck this afternoon or
   tomorrow morning.
   .
   # Hypertension. Hold home meds for now (lasix, diltiazem, isosorbide
   mononitrate)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia. High dose statin as above.
   .
   # GERD. Continue home PPI.
   .
   # Agitation/discomfort. Morphine prn pain.
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: On heparin drip for possible ACS, pneumoboots; PPI
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Son, [**Name (NI) 2476**] [**Name (NI) 14418**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14419**]
   # Code: Presumed full per initial discussion with family, unable to
   discuss with patient.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the hospital with confusion, complaints of inability to hear, and fever. He was intubated for agitation and tachypnea. The patient has multiple medical complications including hyperkalemia, troponin leak, acute kidney injury, fever with possible pneumonia, tachypnea, sudden hearing loss, hyponatremia, elevated coagulation and liver function tests, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Change in Mental Status: The patient's confusion and headache could be due to sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia, or electrolyte imbalance.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level requires careful monitoring and treatment with insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, and kayexalate.
3. Troponin Leak: Elevated troponin levels indicate possible myocardial injury. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, which could be due to new acute ischemia or increased cardiac demand.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, possibly secondary to prerenal causes and/or ATN in the setting of possible sepsis.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in
   setting of agitation/change in mental status/tachypnea. Pt now on PSV
   [**5-18**] FiO2 50%.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation pending MRI as discussed below
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, toxins.  LP performed in ED does not show a
   pattern typical for bacterial infection.
   Acute hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious
   etiology. Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.
   - hold antibiotics for now
   - continue acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending CSF HSV
   PCR results
   - check cortisol level for adrenal insufficiency
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking
   - Obtain brain MRI with contrast when renal function improved
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2.
   - Check K q6h until remains normal X 24 hours
   - Treat ARF as below
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but
   more likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST
   depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, then
   decreased to 0.92 by [**4-18**] morning.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight; will
   discontinue (and restart SCH for prophylaxis) after repeat cardiac labs
   this afternoon show continued decline in enzymes
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE today
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission
   - IVF (bolus to maintain BP > 120 systolic, UOP > 50 cc/hr); urine
   lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN 51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Repeat BUN/Cr in afternoon, follow-up urine sediment
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Blood cx, CSF cx,
   - sputum cx
   - urine cx (though UA benign)
   - F/U  CXR: follow up final read
   - Continue empiric acyclovir (day 1
 [**4-17**]) as above for possible
   encephalitis;
   - Continue levofloxacin (day 1
 [**4-17**]) empirically for possible
   community-acquired PNA given concerning CXR (no known risk factors for
   MRSA); course to be determined pending clinical course. Dose adjust
   based on renal function
   - Follow up urine legionella
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - Follow up TSH
   - MRI with contrast when possible

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with confusion, complaints of inability to hear, and fever. The patient was intubated for agitation and tachypnea and admitted to the MICU.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a FiO2 of 50%. He is also on HOB precautions and VAP precautions.

2. Change in mental status: The patient is confused with a headache and complains of an inability to hear. Differential diagnoses include sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalance, and toxins. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed and did not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection. Acyclovir was started empirically for possible HSV-1 encephalitis, and further testing is pending.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated at 6.7 with EKG changes. Insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, and kayexalate have been given to address this issue. Regular monitoring of potassium levels is required.

   opacities are seen in almost unchanged manner. These opacities could
   reflect both atelectasis and pneumonia. No evidence of newly appeared
   parenchymal opacities. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no
   pulmonary edema. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Unchanged
   position of the endotracheal tube, the tip projects 1.7 cm above the

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in
   setting of agitation/change in mental status/tachypnea. Pt now on PSV
   [**5-18**] FiO2 50%. Pt unable to tolerate trial of pressure support,
   requiring increased sedation.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation today
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in
   ED does not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.
   Acute hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious
   etiology. Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.
   - pt with abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test: continue hydrocortisone
   - hold antibiotics for now
   - continue acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending negative
   CSF HSV PCR results or normal MRI
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking, read pending
   - Brain MRI with contrast, read pending
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. Likely secondary to
   acute on chronic kidney disease
   - Normalized now that pt is at baseline creatinine. Will follow results
   of daily labs.
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but
   more likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST
   depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, now
   normalizing.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE shows EF 55-60%, possible inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis but
   otherwise normal
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission; urine lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN
   51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98. Urine sediment benign.
   - Now at baseline creatinine, Creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-gault
   is 41.
   - IVF (bolus to maintain UOP > 50 cc/hr)
   - Renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine
   legionella negative.  TTE negative for vegetations. Urine cx negative.
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Follow blood cx, CSF cx
   - sputum cx contaminated
   - Continue empiric acyclovir (day 1
 [**4-17**]) as above for possible
   encephalitis
   - Continue levofloxacin (day 1
 [**4-17**]) empirically for possible
   community-acquired PNA given concerning CXR (no known risk factors for
   MRSA); course to be determined pending clinical course.
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - TSH low; will start thyroxine.
   - Follow-up MRI
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving; ?adrenal insufficiency given low cortisol
   - IV fluids
   - Follow-up ACTH/renin
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # Elevated coags/LFTs. Unclear etiology, will recheck.
   .
   # Hypertension. Hold home meds for now (lasix, diltiazem, isosorbide
   mononitrate)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia. High dose statin as above.
   .
   # GERD. Continue home PPI.
   .
   # Agitation/discomfort. Morphine prn pain.
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: On heparin drip for possible ACS, pneumoboots; PPI
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Son, [**Name (NI) 2476**] [**Name (NI) 14418**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14419**]

   discuss with patient.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the hospital with confusion, inability to hear, and fever. The patient was intubated for agitation and tachypnea. He has been admitted to the MICU.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is on pressure support ventilation with FiO2 50%. He was unable to tolerate a trial of pressure support and required increased sedation.
2. Change in Mental Status: The patient is confused with headache and complaining of inability to hear. Differential diagnosis includes sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins. LP performed in the ED does not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level was elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes. He received insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. The high potassium is likely secondary to acute on chronic kidney disease.
4. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated to 1.08, now normalizing. It is unclear if this is due to new acute ischemia or demand in the setting of an acute infection.

   change. The lung volumes have minimally decreased. There is no evidence
   of pleural effusion. However, subtle predominantly basal opacities are
   seen in almost unchanged manner. These opacities could reflect both
   atelectasis and pneumonia. No evidence of newly appeared parenchymal
   opacities. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no pulmonary
   edema. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Unchanged position of
   the endotracheal tube, the tip projects 1.7 cm above the carina and

   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in
   ED does not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.
   Acute hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious
   etiology. Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.

   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able

 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process (found to have
   multi-embolic stroke on MRI), seizure, infectious
   meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia (e.g. from arrhythmia), electrolyte
   imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in ED does not
   show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.  Acute hearing loss may
   be more consistent with viral infectious etiology. Non-infectious
   etiology including vasculitis or microvascular thrombosis/TIA could
   also cause acute hearing loss.  Given low TSH, abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   suspect panhypopituitarism related to ? central process; however as pt
   received high-dose dexamethasone in ED for empiric meningitis
   treatment, his decreased pituitary axis is likely related to that
   rather than a pre-existing proceess. His low response to the [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim
   test is somewhat surprising though and he may have underlying primary
   (adrenally mediated, not pituitary-mediated) adrenal insufficiency.
   - Endocrine following; appreciate recs.
   - Start to taper hydrocort today if clinically stable (go to 25 IV
   q8h).
   - No need to pursue further pituitary fxn testing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with confusion, headache, and complaints of inability to hear. The patient was found to be febrile in the emergency department and was intubated for agitation and tachypnea. He is currently admitted to the MICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis/infection: The patient has a fever and confusion, which could indicate an underlying infection. The differential diagnosis includes meningitis or encephalitis.
2. Acute intracranial process: The patient has shown changes in mental status and acute hearing loss, which could be due to a stroke or multiple embolic strokes as indicated by the MRI findings.
3. Seizure: The patient's agitation and confusion could be attributed to seizures, although this has not been confirmed yet.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient may have experienced hypoxemia due to an arrhythmia, which can lead to confusion and changes in mental status.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has had episodes of hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, which may require close monitoring and correction.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's low cortisol levels suggest possible primary adrenal insufficiency, which should be further evaluated.
7. Endocarditis: Although the blood cultures were negative, the patient's clinical presentation could"

 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in
   setting of agitation/change in mental status/tachypnea. Pt now on PSV
   [**5-18**] FiO2 50%. Pt unable to tolerate trial of pressure support,
   requiring increased sedation. Remains intubated in setting of
   agitation; may be difficult to extubated for this reason.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation today
   - Trial of Precedex
   - Consider Haldol PRN for agitation
   - Attempt to wean from other sedation
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in
   ED does not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.  Acute
   hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious etiology.
   Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.  Given low TSH,
   abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test suspect panhypopituitarism related to ? central
   process.
   - hold antibiotics for now
   - continue acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending negative
   CSF HSV PCR results or normal MRI
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking, read pending
   - F/U brain MRI with contrast, read pending
   - Continue hydrocortisone
   - Check T3/T4 given low TSH (likely related to panhypopituitarism)
   - Check IGF level
   - F/U endocrine recs
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but
   more likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST
   depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, now
   normalizing. Repeat EKG ~unchanged.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight (continue for

   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine
   legionella negative.  TTE negative for vegetations. Urine cx negative.
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Follow blood cx, CSF cx

   - Stop levofloxacin, acyclovir given clear CXR, lack of compelling
   evidence for infectious process
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not

   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with confusion, inability to hear, and fever. He was intubated due to agitation and tachypnea. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute Infarcts: The patient has small acute infarcts in the left occipital and right posterior temporal lobes, indicating possible stroke. Embolic etiology should be considered.

2. Panhypopituitarism: The patient has low TSH and abnormal cortisol levels, suggesting panhypopituitarism. This condition requires further evaluation and management.

3. Possible HSV-1 Encephalitis: The patient is being treated with acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis. This diagnosis needs to be confirmed or ruled out.

4. Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss: The patient has sudden hearing loss, which can be caused by various factors such as viral infection, microvascular events, or autoimmune disorders. Treatment with prednisone and valacyclovir has been initiated.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient had elevated potassium levels, which have since normalized. This may be related to acute on chronic kidney disease.

6. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

7. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has a history of CKD, which is worsening.

8. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has experienced hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, which require close monitoring and management.

9. Infection: The patient initially had fever, and the source of infection is still unclear. Further evaluation is needed to determine the specific infectious agent.

10. Elevated Coags/LFTs: The patient's coagulation and liver function tests are elevated, but the cause is unclear and requires further investigation.

11. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his home medications have been withheld.

12. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, and a high-dose statin has been prescribed.

13. GERD: The patient has a history of GERD, and he will continue taking a proton pump inhibitor.

14. Agitation/Discomfort: The patient is experiencing agitation and discomfort, for which morphine has been given as needed.

15. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving various prophylactic treatments, including heparin drip for possible acute coronary syndrome, pneumoboots, and proton pump inhibitor.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided progress note."

 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process (found to
   have multi-embolic stroke on MRI), seizure, infectious
   meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalance, adrenal
   insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in ED does not show a pattern
   typical for bacterial infection.  Acute hearing loss may be more
   consistent with viral infectious etiology. Non-infectious etiology
   including vasculitis or microvascular thrombosis could also cause acute
   hearing loss.  Given low TSH, abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test suspect
   panhypopituitarism related to ? central process; however as pt received
   high-dose dexamethasone in ED for empiric meningitis treatment, his
   decreased pituitary axis is likely related to that rather than a
   pre-existing proceess. His low response to the [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test is
   somewhat surprising though and he may have underlying primary
   (adrenally mediated, not pituitary-mediated) adrenal insufficiency.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the emergency department with confusion, inability to hear, and fever. He was intubated for agitation and tachypnea and admitted to the medical ICU. The patient has had multiple medical complications including stroke, possible primary adrenal insufficiency, elevated troponin levels, fever with possible pneumonia, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, sudden hearing loss, and elevated coagulation and liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient has small acute infarcts in the left occipital and right posterior temporal lobes, indicating an embolic etiology.
2. Primary Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's symptoms of hypotension and hyperkalemia suggest primary adrenal insufficiency rather than secondary or panhypopituitarism.
3. Elevated Troponin Levels: The elevated troponin levels may be due to myocardial injury, possibly secondary to sepsis or an acute infection.
4. Fever with Possible Pneumonia: The patient's fever and confusion could be indicative of pneumonia. Further workup is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may be related to dehydration, possible sepsis, or an underlying chronic kidney disease.

   MRI head
 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process (found to have
   multi-embolic stroke on MRI), seizure, infectious
   meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia (e.g. from arrhythmia), electrolyte
   imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in ED does not
   show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.  Acute hearing loss may
   be more consistent with viral infectious etiology. Non-infectious
   etiology including vasculitis or microvascular thrombosis/TIA could
   also cause acute hearing loss.  Given low TSH, abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   suspect panhypopituitarism related to ? central process; however as pt
   received high-dose dexamethasone in ED for empiric meningitis
   treatment, his decreased pituitary axis is likely related to that
   rather than a pre-existing proceess. His low response to the [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim
   test is somewhat surprising though and he may have underlying primary
   (adrenally mediated, not pituitary-mediated) adrenal insufficiency.
   - Endocrine following; appreciate recs.
   - Continue hydrocort 50 IV q8h while in ICU, start to taper [**4-20**] if
   clinicall stable (go to 25 IV q8h).
   - No need to pursue further pituitary fxn testing.
   - Consider CT of adrenals to check for atrophied glands
   - Neuro following for stroke; believes triggering event may have been
   paroxysmal arrhythmia that led to multiple emboli to brain. See below
   for recs.
   - Antibiotics/acyclovir stopped yesterday (HSV PCR negative in CSF)
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)

   # STROKE. MR head final read: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should

   - HbA1c and lipid panel pending
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - F/U telemetry for signs of A-fib (if develops, will need
   anticoagulation)
   - Maintain euglycemia/euthermic
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: likely demand in the setting of an acute
   infection.  Had ST depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins
   elevated to 1.08, now normalizing. Repeat EKG ~unchanged.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE shows EF 55-60%, possible inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis but
   otherwise normal

   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness but normal LP and
   HSV PCR, possible LUL PNA given CXR findings, viral infection (URI),
   endocarditis but negative blood cultures and TTE, abdominal process (eg
   diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine legionella
   negative.  Urine cx negative.
   - Follow blood cx, CSF cx
   - sputum cx contaminated
   - Levofloxacin stopped [**4-19**], acyclovir stopped [**4-19**] given lack of
   compelling evidence for infectious process
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission; urine lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN
   51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98. Urine sediment benign.
   - Now at baseline creatinine; creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-gault
   is 41.
   - IVF (bolus to maintain UOP > 50 cc/hr)
   - Renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins

   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving; ?adrenal insufficiency.
   - IV fluids as needed for UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Follow-up ACTH/renin
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. Likely secondary to

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the MICU with confusion, fever, and complaints of inability to hear. The patient was intubated for agitation and tachypnea. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure of 92/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is receiving IV fluids and medications as needed.

The patient has several medical complications, including small acute infarcts in the left occipital and right posterior temporal lobes, likely due to an embolic etiology. There is also a possibility of primary adrenal insufficiency. The patient's electrolyte imbalance, such as hyperkalemia, is likely secondary to acute on chronic kidney disease. His elevated troponin levels are likely due to an acute infection. The patient's elevated coagulation and liver function tests are unclear and pending further results.

The patient's hearing loss has resolved, and his renal function has improved to baseline creatinine levels. His agitation and discomfort are being managed with morphine as needed. The patient's code status is presumed full, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Stroke: The patient has small acute infarcts in the left occipital"
