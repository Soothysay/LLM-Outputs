   # Hypernatremia:  Likely due to poor free water intake.  As per
   previous note, free water deficit is about 7.6-9.2L.  We will correct
   with D5W and monitor serial sodiums.  Ideally, patient should be
   corrected at a rate of 0.5mEq/hour over a 3 day period.
   - 1000ml D5W at 100cc/hour
   - monitor Q4H serum sodium
   - appreciate input from renal
   # Altered mental status:  At baseline according to daughter.  Though
   also exacerbated by abnormal electrolytes.
   - Contact [**Name (NI) 122**] for further information on baseline mental status
   - Treat hypernatremia and UTI
   - Avoid sedating meds
   - Monitor for delirium
   # Acute renal failure:  baseline Cr 1.3-1.7, current Cr 2.4
   Suspect that patient is dehydrated, and lasix and lisinopril may have
   contributed to the toxicity of her prerenal state.  We will hold
   nephrotoxic agens (lasix and lisinopril), trend cr, and continue IVF.
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI
   - f/u urine culture
   - leave in foley now due to hyponatremia
   # HTN:
   - hold lisinopril and lasix for now given ARF
   - continue ASA
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely due to poor access to free water in this demented elderly
   woman.  Other possibilities include central or nephrogenic DI, though
   these are considerably less likely.  Her free water deficit is 7.6-9.2L
   (depending on whether her water is 50-60% of her body weight).  This
   should be given over a 3 day period to correct her at 0.5mEq/hour.
   Thus, D5W at just over 100cc/hr should correct her at the appropriate
   rate.  Per renal recs, we will start with 1/2 NS and monitor serial
   sodiums so as not to correct her too quickly
   - 1/2 NS at 100cc/hr, adjust prn
   - monitor Q4H serum sodium for now
   - appreciate input from renal
   - check Posm, Uosm, UNa
   # Altered mental status:
   Most probably from her hypernatremia and dehydration superimposed on
   abnormal mental status at baseline.
   - contact [**Name (NI) 122**] for further information as to her baseline
   - treat hypernatremia and likely UTI
   - avoid sedating meds
   - monitor for delirium
   # Acute renal failure:  baseline Cr 1.3-1.7, current Cr 2.4
   Suspect that patient is dehydrated, and lasix and lisinopril may have
   contributed to the toxicity of her prerenal state.  She received 1L of
   NS in the ED.
   - recheck Cr in AM
   - send urine lytes
   - hold lisinopril
   # Possible UTI:
   - continue ceftriaxone started in the ED (day 1 = [**1-30**])
   - f/u urine culture
   - patient's foley was placed in ED; will leave in for now given
   hypernatremia
   # Macrocytosis:  check folate and B12
   # Abnormal CXR:
   Noted to possibly have widened mediastinum and possible hiatal hernia
   on recent CXR.
   - recheck PA/lat CXR in AM

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a demented elderly woman with a chief complaint of change in mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and medications.

From the note, it appears that the patient has several medical complications. These include:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level in her blood. This could be due to poor access to free water or other conditions such as central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The patient has a free water deficit of 7.6-9.2L, which needs to be corrected slowly over a period of three days at a rate of 0.5mEq/hour. The plan is to administer D5W at a rate of just over 100cc/hr to correct the sodium levels appropriately.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely due to hypernatremia and dehydration, on top of an abnormal mental status at baseline. Treating the hypernatremia and suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) is important, and sedating medications should be avoided.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.3-1.7, but now it has increased to 2.4. Dehydration and the use of lasix and lisinopril may have contributed to the renal failure. It is recommended to recheck the creatinine levels in the"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with worsening mental status and hypernatremia (high sodium levels). She has a history of dementia and was found to have severe hypernatremia due to inadequate fluid intake, diuretic use, and volume depletion. The patient is currently receiving 1/2 normal saline at 100 cc/hour to restore adequate volume, and her electrolytes will be rechecked every 3-4 hours. 

The patient also has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). There is evidence of a urinary tract infection (UTI) with moderate bacteria in the urine analysis. The UTI is being treated with antibiotics, and the patient's mental status is likely nearing baseline, although it may be affected by the UTI and hypernatremia.

The patient's chest X-ray shows a widened mediastinum, which could be due to various causes such as aortic aneurysm, mediastinal mass, or other conditions. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for UTI prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a H2 blocker, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin. 

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI). She is critically ill and will remain in the ICU, possibly being transferred to the floor if her sodium levels correct."

   # Hypernatremia:  Likely due to poor free water intake in setting of
   furosemide.  Free water deficit was about 7.6-9.2L upon admission, now
   about 2 liters.  Appreciate renal recs, will change IVF to 1/2NS at
   100cc/hr.  Ideally, patient should be corrected at a rate of
   0.5mEq/hour over a 3 day period, goal of 10 mEq drop today to around
   160.
   - 1/2NS 100 cc/hr
   - monitor Q4-6 hour serum sodium -> PICC request for access
   - appreciate input from renal
   # Altered mental status:  At baseline according to daughter.  Though
   also exacerbated by abnormal electrolytes.
   - Treat hypernatremia and UTI
   - Avoid sedating meds
   - Monitor for delirium
   # Acute renal failure:  baseline Cr 1.3-1.7, current Cr 1.7
   Suspect that patient was dehydrated, and lasix and lisinopril may have
   contributed to the toxicity of her prerenal state.  We will hold
   nephrotoxic agens (lasix and lisinopril), trend cr, and continue IVF.
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI
   - f/u urine culture
   - leave in foley now due to hypernatremia
   - will send VBG with next lab draw to eval low bicarb
   # HTN:
   - cont to hold lisinopril given labile BP, hold lasix given euvolemia
   - cont ASA
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypernatremia. The patient has a history of baseline dementia and was unable to provide her medical history. She has allergies to Levaquin and an unknown allergy. The patient is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium for DVT and famotidine for stress ulcers. She is also on other ICU medications and has been receiving D5W at 50 cc/hr, which was restarted due to a slow correction rate.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37Â°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/119 to 173/133 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,273 mL, output of 965 mL, and a balance of 1,308 mL. The patient is not receiving respiratory support.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she appears well-nourished without acute distress. Her cardiovascular and respiratory systems are clear, and she has symmetric breath sounds. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. There is no lower extremity edema observed. The patient's skin is warm, and she intermittently follows commands with altered mental status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypernatremia. The note documents the patient's sodium levels, which were initially high but have been gradually brought down through intravenous fluids. The patient also has a history of dementia and is unable to provide any history themselves.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature within normal range, a heart rate within the normal range for age, blood pressure on the higher side but fluctuating, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 97%.

The patient is on prophylactic heparin for thromboembolic disease and has a history of allergy to levoquin. There is no mention of any other allergies. The patient was previously on ceftriaxone, an antibiotic, until the last dose was given at 08:37 AM on [**2190-1-31**].

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted hypernatremia. The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 2,273 mL of fluids since midnight, with 1,273 mL being IV fluids and 343 mL being TF (total fluid) intake. The total output has been 965 mL of urine and 220 mL of blood products. The balance shows a positive fluid balance of 1,308 mL with 124 mL lost through drains.

The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is admitted with hypernatremia, which is likely due to poor free water intake. A free water deficit of 7.6-9.2L is estimated, and the patient will be corrected with D5W while monitoring serial sodium levels.
- The patient has altered mental status at baseline, according to the daughter, and may also be affected by abnormal electrolytes.
- The patient has acute renal failure, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.3-1.7 and current creatinine level of 1.7. It is suspected that dehydration, possibly exacerbated by medications such as lasix and lisinopril, may have contributed to renal failure. Nephrotoxic agents will be held, and the patient's condition will be monitored.
- The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia, with plans to restart lisinopril given the improvement in serum creatinine and continue statin therapy.
- Foley catheter is in place due to acute renal failure.
- The patient is on various prophylactic measures, including heparin sodium for DVT, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prophylaxis.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) / DNI (do not intubate).
- The patient's disposition is pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypernatremia. She has a history of baseline dementia and is currently in the ICU. The patient has allergies to levaquin and an unknown allergy. She is on prophylactic heparin sodium and other medications. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Vital signs show sinus bradycardia, high blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination findings include symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and warm skin. Neurologic examination reveals intermittent ability to follow commands. Lab results indicate hypernatremia, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels, as well as other abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which can lead to dehydration, seizures, and neurological complications if not corrected properly.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's baseline mental status is altered, and it may be exacerbated by abnormal electrolyte levels.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, indicating possible acute renal failure. This can be caused by factors such as dehydration and nephrotoxic medications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, which could increase the risk of cardiovascular complications if not managed appropriately.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of dementia, admitted to the ICU with hypernatremia and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/31-173/140 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin and has been on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to baseline compromise and significant hypernatremia. Close monitoring and correction of sodium levels are necessary.
2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has a remarkable elevation in sodium, with urine osmolarity >600. This indicates poor urine output and significant volume depletion.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with dementia, admitted for hypernatremia and AMS.
   # Hypernatremia:  Likely due to poor free water intake in setting of
   furosemide.  Free water deficit was about 7.6-9.2L upon admission,
   today is 3.5 L.  Ideally, patient should be corrected at a rate of
   0.5mEq/hour over a 3 day period, goal of 10 mEq drop per 24 hours.
   - Give decrease of only 1 mEq in 8 hrs, will change to D5W at 75cc/hr
   and recheck Na in 6 hours
   - monitor Q6 hour serum sodium -> PICC requested for access
   - appreciate input from renal
   # Altered mental status:  At baseline according to daughter.  Though
   also exacerbated by abnormal electrolytes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, admitted for hypernatremia and altered mental status. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal failure. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection and acute renal failure. The patient's sodium levels need to be corrected cautiously due to her age and pre-existing medical conditions. She requires close monitoring of her renal function, electrolyte levels, and hydration status. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is being considered for discharge to a nursing home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which can lead to various complications such as dehydration, seizures, and organ dysfunction. It is crucial to correct the sodium levels carefully to avoid sudden shifts that could cause harm.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has a history of renal failure and is currently experiencing worsening renal function. This can lead to further deterioration of kidney function, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is being treated for a UTI caused by Proteus species. If not appropriately managed, the infection can worsen, leading to sepsis or other complications.

4. Pressure Injuries: Due to the patient's immobility and altered mental status, she is at risk of developing pressure injuries. Regular turning"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a chief complaint of altered mental status. She has a history of hypertension, renal failure, hyperlipidemia, and an allergy to levoquin (levofloxacin). The patient was admitted to the ICU due to hypernatremia, which is likely caused by poor free water intake in the setting of furosemide. She also has acute renal failure, with baseline creatinine levels ranging from 1.3-1.7 and a current level of 1.5.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/63 mmHg to 117/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 82%. The patient's rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,672 mL and an output of 725 mL, resulting in a balance of 947 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate hypernatremia with a sodium level of 162 mEq/L, as well as elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal chest and cardiac findings. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended, and there"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted with hypernatremia and altered mental status. She has a history of a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Proteus, for which she received treatment. The patient's sodium levels have improved from 161 mEq/L to 133 mEq/L, and her mental status has also improved, as she is now responsive to verbal questions and can follow some limited commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's initial high sodium level indicates hypernatremia. This condition can lead to neurological symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, and seizures if not corrected properly. The patient's current sodium level is improving, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications.

2. UTI: The patient has a known UTI caused by Proteus. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this infection can lead to worsening symptoms, such as increased confusion, fever, and kidney dysfunction.

3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a free water deficit of 3 liters. Improper management of fluid balance may result in dehydration or overhydration, which can contribute to electrolyte imbalances and further complications.

4. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range, but it is important to maintain tight glycemic control to prevent complications like hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

5. Pressure Ulcers: Due to the patient's immob"
