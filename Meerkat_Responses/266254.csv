","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of COPD, CAD, and post-myocardial infarction cardiomyopathy. He presented with cough, shortness of breath for three days, and hemoptysis. The patient has been admitted multiple times before, with the last admission being six weeks ago. He was started on levofloxacin at home but did not experience any relief. In the emergency department, a negative CT angiography (no clot, no infiltrate) was performed. 

The patient has several ongoing issues including acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), hypertension, benign peripheral vascular disease (PVD) without critical limb ischemia, diabetes mellitus (DM) type II, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He also has a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a right-sided pneumonectomy. 

The patient's current vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals diffuse expiratory wheeze, some rhonchi, no accessory muscle use, and a systolic murmur at the apex. 

Lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated troponin-T, low glucose, prolonged PT/PTT/INR, and other electrolyte imbalances. Imaging shows moderate pulmonary edema and a right-sided effusion but no pulmonary embolism. 

The patient's plan includes changing antibiotics to vancomycin and levofloxacin, starting prednisone, providing standing nebulizers, and following up with cultures. He will continue his home dose of milrinone and receive Lasix. The heart failure service will be consulted, and the patient's INR will be monitored due to potential elevation from antibiotic use. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, PICC line, prophylactic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease post-stroke, previous myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) status post left pneumonectomy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and hypertension. He presented with cough and shortness of breath for three days. On admission, he was able to ambulate within the room but experienced dyspnea while walking across the room. He also had cough productive of blood-tinged sputum. Nebulizers, antibiotics, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) were administered in the emergency department.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), current temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 103-117 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 85/52-104/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has a history of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, but it is not currently active. His last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin on January 29th at 6:00 AM, and vancomycin was administered on January 29th at 9"

   cancer s/p left pneumonectomy presents with respiratory distress x 3
   days
   .
   1) Respiratory distress: Patient with new productive cough in the
   absence of clear pulmonary infiltrate, failed levofloxacin x 3 days at
   home as empiric treatment for community acquired pneumonia. Suspect
   infectious etiology given elevated lactate, chills, and sputum
   production; however, cannot rule out multifactorial picture given his
   history of COPD and CHF. PE ruled out by CTA in ED. Patient with
   chronic emphysematous changes and superimposed pulmonary edema on chest
   CT. Patient is at notable risk for nosocomial infections given
   protracted hospitalization in [**Month (only) 25**] followed by rehab stay. Was
   started on vanc/levo, but now w/ + RSV, abx d/c'd.
   - continue steroids, and begin to taper tomorrow
   - repeat induced sputum for culture, first was contaminant
   - Urine legionella negative
   - BNP at baseline
   - continue Spiriva with PRN albuterol
   - Guaifenesin q6h as mucolytic

   2) Cardiac:
   (a) Pump: most recent EF 15-20%, with severe systolic dysfunction.
   - Will continue patient's milrinone drip
   - Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - appears that patient's baseline SBP is 85-95
   - HF fellow was paged and emailed yesterday w/ no reply
   (b) Rhythm: patient with h/o PAF, on amiodarone 200 mg daily,
   anticoagulated on coumadim, currently supratherapeutic.
   (c) Vessels: Known severe multi-vessel disease.
   - continue ASA, plavix
   .
   3) ARF: Patient presented with creatinine 1.8 up from baseline of 1.2,
   was down to 1.4 w/ hydration, and believed to be likely prerenal in the
   setting of intravascular volume depletion, superimposed on mild chronic
   renal insufficiency. Now up to 1.7 w/ new hyponatremia. Will check PO
   lytes.
   - gentle PO rehydration
   .
   4) DM2: Glyburide held in the setting of acute illness.
   - SSI with goal for BG<150
   - sugars up today while using steroids, and SS was increased.
   .
   5) Supratherapeutic INR: INR of 7.2 on presentation on stable dose,
   elevated in setting of abx. Coumadin being held. was 7.9 today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and remote history of lung cancer who underwent left pneumonectomy. He presents with respiratory distress for the past three days and has been diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The patient also has elevated lactate levels, chills, and sputum production, indicating a possible infectious etiology. His condition is complicated by chronic emphysematous changes and superimposed pulmonary edema. He has been hospitalized for a prolonged period, increasing his risk for nosocomial infections. 

The patient's medical history includes severe systolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%, h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and severe multi-vessel disease. His current medications include milrinone, amiodarone, aspirin (ASA), and clopidogrel (plavix).

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as an increase in creatinine from his baseline value. His electrolytes are also imbalanced, with hyponatremia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a remote history of lung cancer who underwent a left pneumonectomy.
- He presents with respiratory distress for the past three days, characterized by a productive cough, elevated lactate levels, chills, and sputum production.
- Initial suspicion is an infectious etiology, but other factors such as COPD and CHF cannot be ruled out.
- A computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the emergency department ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient has chronic emphysematous changes and superimposed pulmonary edema on chest CT.
- He has been hospitalized for a prolonged period, which puts him at risk for nosocomial infections.
- Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is confirmed.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated for nosocomial pneumonia.
- Additional tests include induced sputum for culture, repeat urine legionella test, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) at baseline, and continued use of Spiriva with rescue albuterol as needed.
- The patient's cardiac function is severely compromised, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and severe systolic dysfunction.
- Milrinone drip will continue, and Lasix 100 mg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with severe cardiomyopathy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with an acute exacerbation of COPD in the setting of a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The patient has a history of pneumonectomy, heart failure (systolic, chronic), peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease.

24-hour events include RSV positivity, blood and urine cultures taken, and a change in antibiotic therapy. The patient is currently receiving various medications such as piperacillin, vancomycin, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is not in acute distress, with vital signs showing tachycardia, hypotension, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient has diminished breath sounds bilaterally and trace bilateral edema. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and troponin-T levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation due to RSV infection, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient's medications are being adjusted, and he is receiving nebulizer treatments, spirometer use, and other respiratory support measures.
