   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 64 M w/ pmh of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder,
   increasing debilitation presents from a nursing home with lethargy,
   admitted to medicine and treated for PNA, now s/p an episode of
   tonic-clonic seizures and intubation for airway protection.
   .
   # Status epilpeticus: Has a 3-year history of intermittent seizures w/o
   obvious cause.  Was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission and keppra
   was just being added today.  Does not appear to be seizing any longer.
   Head CT on admission unchanged from prior.
   - appreciate neuro recs, will bolus w/ dilantin and LeVETiracetam and
   continue to follow.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Witnessed apnea in the setting of continued
   sezures so was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation (O2
   sats always okay).  Also being treated for a health-care acquired PNA.
   Blood cx from admission w/ NGTD.
   - Will change from linezolid to vancomycin given leukopenia and concern
   for BM supression and change from flagyl/ceftriaxone to zosyn for broad
   coverage of possible HAP
   - sputum cx
   .
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Appears mildly dry by exam/cr/lytes so will bolus IVF and follow
   urine output.
   - hold metoprolol for now as pressures have been lower (SBP 100s
   post-intubation)
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - hold blood pressure meds for now as above.
   .
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   - follow clinically, no recent lipids, not on ASA, statin
   .
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - check an ammonia level given presentation w/ altered mental status
   - lactulose, rifaxamin
   .
   # Thromobocytopenia: Likely secondary to cirrhosis but given that he
   has been on linezolid, also concerning for some BM supression.
   - trend for now
   .
   # Leukopenia: Concerning for BM supression given that he is on
   linezolid.
   - will switch to vancomycin as above
   - trend for now
   .
   # Anemia: Macrocytic. Hct is close to baseline.
   - guiac stools
   .
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG
   (failed s/s eval while here)
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: R femoral line placed peri-code, will need a PICC in am

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder, increasing debilitation, and other comorbidities. He was admitted to the hospital with lethargy and treated for pneumonia (PNA). The patient experienced an episode of tonic-clonic seizures and was intubated for airway protection.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:

1. Status Epilepticus: The patient has a history of intermittent seizures without an obvious cause. He was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission, and keppra was being added today. There are no signs of seizures at the moment. The head CT on admission showed no changes from prior imaging. The plan is to bolus with dilantin and LeVETiracetam and continue to follow neurology recommendations.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient witnessed apnea during continued seizures and was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation. He is also being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Blood cultures from admission showed no growth. The plan is to change from linezolid to vancomycin due to leukopenia and concern for bone marrow suppression. From flagyl/ceftriaxone to Zosyn for broad coverage of possible HAP. A sputum culture is pending.

3. Stage IV Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: An X-ray of the sacral area did not suggest"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 64 M w/ pmh of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder,
   increasing debilitation presents from a nursing home with lethargy,
   admitted to medicine and treated for PNA, now s/p an episode of
   tonic-clonic seizures and intubation for airway protection.
   .
   # Status epilpeticus: Has a 3-year history of intermittent seizures w/o
   obvious cause.  Was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission and keppra
   was just being added today.  Head CT on admission unchanged from prior.
   - appreciate neuro recs,
   - pt received bolus of dilantin and LeVETiracetam on transfer.
   - continue on topamax, zonisamide, keppra, and dilantin
   - will change doses based on neuro recs to eventually taper dilantin
   off.  Will increase keppra tomorrow to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] for two days, then
   increase to 2250mg [**Hospital1 **].  When increase to that dose of keppra will
   increase topamax to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].  During that time we will decrease
   dilantin.  Also, depending on level of sedation, patient may require
   additional antiseizure meds.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Witnessed apnea in the setting of continued
   sezures so was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation (O2
   sats always okay).  Also being treated for a health-care acquired PNA.
   Blood cx from admission w/ NGTD.
   - Will continue vancomycin and zosyn for possible HAP
   - f/u sputum cx
   - will attempt to wean tomorrow
   .
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Appears mildly dry by exam/cr/lytes so will bolus IVF and follow
   urine output.
   - hold metoprolol for now as pressures have been lower (SBP 100s
   post-intubation)
   - will attempt to diurese today to get the patient even
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - hold blood pressure meds for now as above.
   .
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   - follow clinically, no recent lipids, not on ASA, statin
   .
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - check an ammonia level given presentation w/ altered mental status
   - lactulose, rifaxamin
   .
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG
   (failed s/s eval while here)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), seizure disorder, increasing debilitation, and other comorbidities such as chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypothyroidism.

The patient presented with lethargy and was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia. He subsequently experienced a tonic-clonic seizure and was intubated for airway protection. The patient also has a history of intermittent seizures without an obvious cause and was on topiramate and zonisamide before admission. On transfer, he received a bolus of phenytoin and levetiracetam.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to witnessed apnea during seizures, health-care acquired pneumonia (HAP), stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, cirrhosis, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics for HAP, antiepileptic drugs, antihypertensives, antidiabetics, and medications for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 101/60 mmHg, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits at 36.7Â°C.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 69 K/uL, sodium of 113 mg/dL, potassium of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 173 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:
- Status epilepticus: Continue on topiramate, zonisamide, keppra, and dilantin. Adjust doses based on neurologic recommendations.
- Respiratory failure: Continue mechanical ventilation and wean off tomorrow.
- Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer: Continue wound care with packing daily.
- Chronic diastolic heart failure: Bolus IV fluids and monitor urine output. Hold metoprolol for now.
- Hypertension: Hold blood pressure medications for now.
- Coronary artery disease: Follow clinically and consider stress MIBI.
- Diabetes mellitus type 2: Continue current regimen of lantus and humalog, and titrate up as needed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), seizure disorder, increasing debilitation, and other comorbidities such as chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypothyroidism.

The patient presented with lethargy, was admitted to the medicine service for pneumonia (PNA), experienced an episode of tonic-clonic seizures, and subsequently required intubation for airway protection. He also has a history of intermittent seizures without an obvious cause and is currently on topiramate, zonisamide, and keppra.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including respiratory failure, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, CAD, DM2, cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, hypothyroidism, and impaired skin integrity.

He is currently receiving various treatments including antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia, antiepileptic drugs, IV fluids, tube feeds via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 101/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient remains intubated and sedated.

Further diagnostic tests and consultations are pending, including a stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MIBI) for CAD, abdominal ultrasound for liver evaluation, ammonia level for altered mental status, and stool guaiac for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient is facing multiple medical challenges requiring ongoing management and monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU)."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 64 M w/ pmh of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder,
   increasing debilitation presents from a nursing home with lethargy,
   admitted to medicine and treated for PNA, now s/p an episode of
   tonic-clonic seizures and intubation for airway protection.
   .
   # Status epilpeticus: Has a 3-year history of intermittent seizures w/o
   obvious cause.  Was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission and keppra
   was just being added today.  Head CT on admission unchanged from prior.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - will change doses based on neuro recs to eventually taper dilantin
   off.  Continue Keppra at 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] day [**1-20**], then increase to 2250mg
   [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow for 2 days.  When increase to that dose of keppra will
   increase topamax to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].  During that time we will decrease
   dilantin.  Also, depending on level of sedation, patient may require
   additional antiseizure meds, and will contact neuro regarding this
   issue.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Witnessed apnea in the setting of continued
   siezures so was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation
   (O2 sats always okay).  Also being treated for a health-care acquired
   PNA.  Blood cx from admission w/ NGTD.
   - Will discontinue antibiotics as no clear source for infection
   - f/u sputum cx
   - will attempt to change to PS
   - Will consider diuresis to improve ventilation, but will check urine
   lytes first, may be limited by blood pressures
   .
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Appears mildly dry by exam/cr/lytes so will bolus IVF and follow
   urine output.
   - hold metoprolol for now as pressures have been lower (SBP 100s
   post-intubation)
   - will attempt to diurese today to get the patient even
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - hold blood pressure meds for now as above.
   .
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   - follow clinically, no recent lipids, not on ASA, statin
   .
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - check an ammonia level given presentation w/ altered mental status
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   .
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG
   (failed s/s eval while here)
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: PICC placed, will need fem line removed

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a medical history of cirrhosis, seizure disorder, increasing debilitation, and other chronic conditions. She presented to the hospital with lethargy, was treated for pneumonia, experienced an episode of tonic-clonic seizures, and required intubation for airway protection. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic diastolic heart failure, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, hypertension, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to witnessed apnea during continuous seizures. She was intubated for airway protection and ventilation. Oxygen saturation levels are always okay.
2. Healthcare-associated Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is being treated for HAP. Antibiotics will be discontinued as no clear source of infection is identified. Follow-up sputum culture will be done.
3. Seizures: The patient has a history of intermittent seizures without an obvious cause. She is currently on topiramate, zonisamide, and keppra. The doses will be changed based on neurologic recommendations to eventually taper off dilantin. Keppra will be continued at 1500 mg for the next few days and then increased to 2250 mg. Topamax will be increased to 200 mg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 81-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various medical interventions. The patient has a history of impaired skin integrity, seizure without status epilepticus, hypotension (not in shock), and oliguria/anuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of the ventilator increases the risk of VAP, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheter use increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
4. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infections and other complications.
5. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Seizure recurrence: The patient's history of seizure increases the risk of recurrent seizures, especially if there are imbalances in electrolytes or medication errors.
7. Renal dysfunction: Oliguria/anuria suggests potential renal dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 64 M w/ pmh of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder,
   increasing debilitation presents from a nursing home with lethargy,
   admitted to medicine and treated for PNA, now s/p an episode of
   tonic-clonic seizures and intubation for airway protection.
   .
   # Status epilpeticus: Has a 3-year history of intermittent seizures w/o
   obvious cause.  Was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission and keppra
   was just being added today.  Head CT on admission unchanged from prior.
   - appreciate neuro recs,
   - pt received bolus of dilantin and LeVETiracetam on transfer.
   - continue on topamax, zonisamide, keppra, and dilantin
   - will change doses based on neuro recs to eventually taper dilantin
   off.  Will increase keppra tomorrow to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] for two days, then
   increase to 2250mg [**Hospital1 **].  When increase to that dose of keppra will
   increase topamax to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].  During that time we will decrease
   dilantin.  Also, depending on level of sedation, patient may require
   additional antiseizure meds.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Witnessed apnea in the setting of continued
   sezures so was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation (O2
   sats always okay).  Also being treated for a health-care acquired PNA.
   Blood cx from admission w/ NGTD.
   - Will continue vancomycin and zosyn for possible HAP
   - f/u sputum cx
   - will attempt to wean tomorrow
   .
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Appears mildly dry by exam/cr/lytes so will bolus IVF and follow
   urine output.
   - hold metoprolol for now as pressures have been lower (SBP 100s
   post-intubation)
   - will attempt to diurese today to get the patient even
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - hold blood pressure meds for now as above.
   .
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   - follow clinically, no recent lipids, not on ASA, statin
   .
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - check an ammonia level given presentation w/ altered mental status
   - lactulose, rifaxamin
   .
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG
   (failed s/s eval while here)
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: R femoral line placed peri-code, will need a PICC in am

","The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications. The patient's condition has been closely monitored, and several interventions have been performed.

24-hour events:
- The patient underwent a multi-lumen central venous catheter placement on [**2199-12-26**] 06:17 PM. The hepatology team was consulted, but the patient declined treatment until they were more awake.
- Neurologic recovery was delayed due to midazolam infusion. It was decided to hold off on decreasing the midazolam until the morning when the EEG could be more readily monitored.
- Urine electrolytes were concentrated, but the patient's hypernatremia improved.
- A trial of pressure support (PS) ventilation was successful.
- The patient's right femoral line was pulled.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), seizure disorder, increasing debilitation, and previous nursing home stay. He presents with lethargy and was admitted to the medicine service for pneumonia. He experienced an episode of tonic-clonic seizures and required intubation for airway protection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to a witnessed apnea during continued seizures, leading to intubation for both airway protection and ventilation. He is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia, and blood cultures from admission show NGTD. Antibiotics will be discontinued as there is no clear source of infection, and follow-up sputum cultures will be done. Pressure support will continue, and consideration will be given to diuresis to improve ventilation, but urine electrolytes will be checked first.
2. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of intermittent seizures without an obvious cause. He was on topiramate and zonisamide on admission, and keppra was being added today. Phenytoin 100mg PO TID is planned for tapering, and keppra 1500mg PO BID will be increased to 2250mg at [Hospital1] for two days. Topamax will be increased to 200mg PO BID in two days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), seizure disorder, increasing debilitation, and chronic illnesses. He presents with lethargy, admitted to medicine for pneumonia (PNA), and now experiences an episode of tonic-clonic seizures, leading to intubation for airway protection. The patient has multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, cirrhosis, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and is on various medications. The patient is currently being treated for healthcare-acquired pneumonia, seizure disorder, and has ongoing management of his chronic conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and potential complications related to sedation and paralysis.
2. Seizure Disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may continue or recur, leading to further complications such as status epilepticus or postictal state. Management of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) needs to be carefully monitored.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis may progress, resulting in complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 64 M w/ pmh of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder,
   increasing debilitation presents from a nursing home with lethargy,
   admitted to medicine and treated for PNA, now s/p an episode of
   tonic-clonic seizures and intubation for airway protection.
   # Seizure disorder: Has a 3-year history of intermittent seizures w/o
   obvious cause.  Was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission and keppra
   was just being added today.  Head CT on admission unchanged from prior.
   - Phenytoin taper to 100mg PO BIDx3 days, then QD 3days then d/c.
   - Keppra 1500mg PO BID to 2250 [**Hospital1 **] today
   - Increase Topamax to 200mg PO BID once Keppra uptitrated.
   # Respiratory failure: Witnessed apnea in the setting of continued
   seizures so was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation
   (O2 sats always okay).  Also being treated for a health-care acquired
   PNA.  Blood cx from admission w/ NGTD.
   - Will discontinue antibiotics as no clear source for infection
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Continue Pressure Support
   - Will consider diuresis to improve ventilation, but will check urine
   lytes first, may be limited by blood pressures
   - Wean fentanyl/midazolam
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Appears mildly dry by exam/cr/lytes so will bolus IVF and follow
   urine output.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with a medical history of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder, increasing debilitation, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and feeding tube (FEN).

The patient was admitted to the medicine department for pneumonia (PNA) and later experienced an episode of tonic-clonic seizures, resulting in intubation for airway protection. She has a history of intermittent seizures without an obvious cause and was on topiramate, zonisamide, and keppra before admission. The head CT on admission showed no significant changes.

The patient's current conditions and plans include:

1. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure medications are being adjusted, with phenytoin tapering off and keppra being uptitrated. Topamax dosage is increased once keppra is uptitrated.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation due to witnessed apnea during seizures. She is being treated for healthcare-acquired PNA. Antibiotics will be discontinued as there is no clear source for infection. Further evaluation of sputum culture and continued pressure support are planned. Weaning of fentanyl/midazolam is also considered.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has"

   This is a 64 M w/ pmh of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder,
   increasing debilitation presents from a nursing home with lethargy,
   admitted to medicine and treated for PNA, now s/p an episode of
   tonic-clonic seizures and intubation for airway protection.
   # Seizure disorder: Has a 3-year history of intermittent seizures w/o
   obvious cause.  Was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission and keppra
   was just being added today.  Head CT on admission unchanged from prior.
   - Phenytoin taper to 100mg PO BIDx3 days, then QD 3days then d/c.
   - Keppra 1500mg PO BID to 2250 [**Hospital1 **] today
   - Increase Topamax to 200mg PO BID once Keppra uptitrated.
   # Respiratory failure: Witnessed apnea in the setting of continued
   seizures so was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation
   (O2 sats always okay).  Also being treated for a health-care acquired
   PNA.  Blood cx from admission w/ NGTD.
   - Will discontinue antibiotics as no clear source for infection
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Continue Pressure Support
   - Will consider diuresis to improve ventilation, but will check urine
   lytes first, may be limited by blood pressures
   - Wean fentanyl/midazolam
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Appears mildly dry by exam/cr/lytes so will bolus IVF and follow
   urine output.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder, increasing debilitation, and other comorbidities. The patient presented with lethargy, was admitted to the medicine service, treated for pneumonia, experienced an episode of tonic-clonic seizures, and subsequently required intubation for airway protection.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of intermittent seizures without an obvious cause. He is currently on keppra, phenytoin, and topiramate. The plan is to taper phenytoin and increase the dose of keppra.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection and ventilation due to witnessed apnea during seizures. He is also being treated for healthcare-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotics will be discontinued as there is no clear source of infection, and follow-up sputum culture will be done.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has NASH-related cirrhosis, but liver function tests, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters have not been elevated. An abdominal ultrasound showed normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall flow, and no ascites were identified.

4. Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a chronic sacral decubitus ulcer, and daily wound care with packing is being continued.

   obvious cause.  Was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission and keppra
   added on admission.  Head CT on admission unchanged from prior.
   - Phenytoin taper to 100mg PO BIDx3 days, then QD 3days then d/c.
   - Increased Keppra initially up to 1500mg PO BID and now currently at
   2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Increased Topamax to 200mg PO BID now
   - S/W Neurology regarding titrating down midazolam, they are OK with
   the other antiseizure medications he is currently getting, no need to
   uptitrate
   - monitor closely for seizure activity with continuous EEG monitoring.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder, increasing debilitation, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and a feeding tube (PEG) in place. The patient was admitted to the medicine service for pneumonia (PNA) and subsequently experienced an episode of tonic-clonic seizures, leading to intubation for airway protection.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypernatremia, cirrhosis, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic diastolic heart failure, HTN, CAD, DM2, pancytopenia, and hypothyroidism. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and continuous EEG monitoring should be maintained to promptly detect any seizure activity.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, possibly secondary to the witnessed apnea during seizures. Weaning off ventilation and sedation should be done cautiously.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male admit with pneumonia and with respiratory failure in the
   setting of recurrent seizure activity and known seizure disorder.  He
   does have ongoing input from Neurology in regards to management of
   seizure disorder and by their report there is not evidence of current
   active seizure.  His intubation was in large part related to seizure
   activity and altered mental status but has been slow to be able to move
   to weaning in large part due to altered mental status.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with CMV support in place
he has plateau
   at 24 suggesting reasonable compliance with PEEP=8 and Vt=500.  Would
   favor move to PSV this morning.
   -Continue PSV wean
   -Move to SBT and Extubation to be limited by mental status
   -Will wean Versed as possible given agitation
   -Repeat CXR in morning
   -Minimal secretions
   -Goal is to be able to move to extubation tomorrow
   2)Seizure Disorder-
   -Versed 2mg/hr
   -Thiamine/Folate
   -Keppra
   -Dilantin
   -Topomax to increase today to 200mg today

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 64 M w/ pmh of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder,
   increasing debilitation presents from a nursing home with lethargy,
   admitted to medicine and treated for PNA, now s/p an episode of
   tonic-clonic seizures and intubation for airway protection.
   # Seizure disorder: Has a 3-year history of intermittent seizures w/o
   obvious cause.  Was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission and keppra
   added on admission.  Head CT on admission unchanged from prior.
   - Phenytoin taper to 100mg PO BIDx3 days, then QD 3days then d/c.
   - Increased Keppra initially up to 1500mg PO BID and now currently at
   2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Increased Topamax to 200mg PO BID now
   - S/W Neurology regarding titrating down midazolam, they are OK with
   the other antiseizure medications he is currently getting, no need to
   uptitrate
   - monitor closely for seizure activity with continuous EEG monitoring.
   # Respiratory failure: Witnessed apnea in the setting of continued
   seizures so was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation
   (O2 sats always okay).  Also being treated for a health-care acquired
   PNA.  Blood cx from admission w/ NGTD.
   - Will discontinue antibiotics as no clear source for infection
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Will attempt to wean sedation and wean off ventilation as tolerated
   - Wean fentanyl/midazolam
   # Hypernatremia:  Improved with free water flushes with TF.   Will
   continue q4h for tonight, and reassess Na level this afternoon and
   tomorrow.
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Appears mildly dry by exam/cr/lytes so will bolus IVF and follow
   urine output.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), seizure disorder, increasing debilitation, and previous nursing home stay. He presented with lethargy and was admitted to the medicine service for pneumonia. He subsequently experienced an episode of tonic-clonic seizures and required intubation for airway protection.

The patient has been treated for a healthcare-associated pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His seizure medications include topiramate, zonisamide, and keppra, with phenytoin being tapered off. There are plans to continue monitoring for seizure activity with continuous EEG monitoring.

The patient also has hypernatremia, which has improved with free water flushes through the tube feeding (TF) route. He will continue with q4h free water flushes for tonight and reassessment of the sodium level this afternoon and tomorrow.

Other medical conditions include cirrhosis, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and fecal incontinence. The patient is receiving tube feeds through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off mechanical ventilation suggests ongoing respiratory failure. The RS"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 64 M w/ pmh of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder,
   increasing debilitation presents from a nursing home with lethargy,
   admitted to medicine and treated for PNA, now s/p an episode of
   tonic-clonic seizures and intubation for airway protection.
   # Seizure disorder: Has a 3-year history of intermittent seizures w/o
   obvious cause.  Was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission and keppra
   added on admission.  Head CT on admission unchanged from prior.
   - Phenytoin taper to 100mg PO BIDx3 days, then QD 3days then d/c.
   - Increased Keppra initially up to 1500mg PO BID and now currently at
   2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Increased Topamax to 200mg PO BID now
   - S/W Neurology regarding titrating down midazolam, they are OK with
   the other antiseizure medications he is currently getting, no need to
   uptitrate
   - monitor closely for seizure activity with continuous EEG monitoring.
   # Respiratory failure: Witnessed apnea in the setting of continued
   seizures so was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation
   (O2 sats always okay).  Also being treated for a health-care acquired
   PNA.  Blood cx from admission w/ NGTD.
   - Will discontinue antibiotics as no clear source for infection
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Will attempt to wean sedation and wean off ventilation as tolerated,
   but patient appears to have some air trapping and may not tolerate
   wean.
   - Wean fentanyl/midazolam
   - Diuresis-20 lasix IV, titrate to 1.5 L negative today
   -PM lytes
   # Hypernatremia:  Improved with free water flushes with TF.   Continue
   to monitor
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Stable on exam.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, admitted with respiratory failure and significant seizure activity. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving antiseizure medications. The patient's condition is complicated by impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), seizure, hypotension, oliguria/anuria, and oligoanuria. The patient's vital signs show tachypnea, sinus rhythm, and normal blood pressure. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,850 mL and total output of 1,868 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and increased creatinine levels. Imaging shows no significant change in chest X-ray, and microbiology reveals rare oral flora in sputum. The patient's plan includes continued assisted ventilation, weaning of sedation, and attempts to liberate from mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is critical. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may progress if not properly managed, leading to further compromise in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can lead to pressure ulcers or infections, which can worsen his overall condition.
3. Seizure Activity: Continued seizure activity can impact the patient's neurological function and increase the risk of further complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may indicate poor"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 year old gentleman with NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder and
   increasing debilitation continues in the ICU after a seizure.  He
   remains intubated for airway protection and unsuccessfully weaned from
   ventilation.
   # Respiratory failure:  Witness apnea during code and recent HCAP.
   Still requires ventilatory support.  Sputum culture negative.
   - Will attempt to wean sedation and wean off ventilation as tolerated,
   but patient appears to have some air trapping and may not tolerate
   wean.
   - Wean fentanyl/midazolam
   # Seizure disorder:
   - Phenytoin taper- currently QD x3 days
   - Keppra 2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Topamax 200mg PO BID
   # Hypernatremia:  Improved with free water flushes with TF.   Continue
   to monitor
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Stable on exam.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder, and increasing debilitation. He remains in the ICU after experiencing a seizure and requires ventilatory support. The patient's medical history includes chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and fatty liver disease.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypernatremia, cirrhosis, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, pancytopenia, and hypothyroidism.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient requires ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. There is a concern about weaning him off ventilation as he appears to have some air trapping.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels. Monitoring and free water flushes will be necessary to manage this condition.

3. Cirrhosis: Although the patient's liver function tests, bilirubin, and coagulation profile are within normal limits, ongoing monitoring is required due to his underlying cirrhosis.

4. Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a severe pressure ulcer on the sacrum. Daily wound care with packing is being performed, but further management may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an unresponsive individual with encephalopathy admitted to the ICU. The patient received a trial of prone positioning overnight, which was unsuccessful. The patient has a history of medical records but is unable to provide their own history due to the encephalopathy and unresponsiveness. There are no known drug allergies.

Infusions and medications include midazolam, furosemide, fosphenytoin, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications are also being administered.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.3Â°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/56 mmHg to 91/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,978 mL, including 872 mL by mouth, 1,802 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 795 mL through intravenous fluids. Output includes 3,170 mL of urine, 500 mL of nasal gastric drainage, and 400 mL of stool. The overall fluid balance is 808 mL positive.

The patient's blood products show an output of 970 mL. The respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode, assisted/supported spontaneous breaths, and auto-flow. The ventilator settings include a set volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 185. The plateau pressure is 28 cmH2O, and the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 31 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 99%.

Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin, and neurologic examination. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The blood glucose levels are elevated. Other lab results include elevated lactate levels and abnormal electrolyte levels such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The imaging shows bilateral lower lobe opacities with an endotracheal tube that appears kinked but in place. The microbiology report indicates the presence of gram-negative rods and yeast in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder, and increasing debilitation. He is currently in the ICU after experiencing a seizure and remains intubated for airway protection and unsuccessfully weaned from ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, seizure disorder, hypernatremia, cirrhosis, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and feeding tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to breathe independently and reliance on mechanical ventilation indicates respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and support are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of pulmonary edema suggests fluid accumulation in the lungs, potentially due to heart failure or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring of fluid balance and respiratory status is required to manage this complication.
3. Seizure Disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder indicates a predisposition to recurrent seizures. Ensuring proper management of seizure medications and monitoring for any new seizure activity is crucial.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels require careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications related to electrolyte imbalances.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient's NASH cirrhosis may contribute to various complications such"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 year old gentleman with NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder and
   increasing debilitation continues in the ICU after a seizure.  He
   remains intubated for airway protection and unsuccessfully weaned from
   ventilation.
   # Respiratory failure:  Witnessed apnea during code and recent HCAP.
   Still requires ventilatory support for what appears to be pulmonary
   edema.  Tolerated PS trial in AM, but still tachypneic
   - Lasix gtt to goal output of 1 liter by afternoon
   - Wean as tolerated, with hope to extubate this afternoon.
   - Hold TF in anticipation of extubation
   # Seizure disorder:  Keppra order had expired, will restart today.
   - Phenytoin taper- currently QD x3 days (ending [**2200-1-1**])
   - Keppra 2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Topamax 200mg PO BID
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved.
   - D/C free water flushes as attempting to reduce volume.
   - Check PM lytes given diuresis
   .
   # Hypogylcemia
   -  currently resolved and trending up.  Will give
 dose of insulin
   today as
 dose yesterday still made patient hypoglycemic and currently
   hold TF
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Stable on exam.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG-Held
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with a history of NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder, and increasing debilitation. He is currently in the ICU after experiencing a seizure and remains intubated for airway protection and unsuccessfully weaned from ventilation. The patient has multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, seizure disorder, hypernatremia, hypoglycemia, cirrhosis, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still requiring ventilatory support for what appears to be pulmonary edema. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening pulmonary edema.
2. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is currently on phenytoin and topiramate. Restarting Keppra has been ordered. There is a risk of recurrent seizures or medication-related side effects.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were elevated, but have since resolved. There is a risk of electrolyte imbalances if fluid management is not carefully monitored.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced a hypoglycemic episode and received dextrose. There is a risk of recurrent hypoglycemia, especially if insulin"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and requires ventilatory support due to pulmonary edema. This indicates a severe respiratory condition that requires close monitoring and intervention.

2. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and their current medication order for Keppra had expired. Restarting the medication is important to manage their seizures effectively.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient previously had an elevated sodium level, which has since resolved. However, monitoring for any potential electrolyte imbalances remains important.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although liver function tests, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters have not been elevated, ongoing monitoring of liver function is necessary.

5. Stage IV Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a severe pressure ulcer on their sacrum. Proper wound care management, including daily packing, is crucial to prevent further complications.

6. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has mild left ventricular hypertrophy and stable on exam. Regular monitoring of heart function and symptoms is essential.

7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled while in-house on metoprolol 12.5 mg. However, ongoing management of blood pressure is necessary to prevent hypertensive"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with a history of NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder, and increasing debilitation. He remains intubated in the ICU after experiencing a seizure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient still requires ventilatory support for what appears to be pulmonary edema. There is a plan to wean him from the ventilator as tolerated and potentially extubate this afternoon.

2. Seizure disorder: The patient's Keppra order had expired, so it will be restarted today. There is also a plan to taper phenytoin and start taking topiramate.

3. Hypernatremia: This condition has resolved, but the patient's sodium levels should continue to be monitored.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels are currently resolved, but there is a plan to give a dose of insulin today as the previous dose made the patient hypoglycemic.

5. Cirrhosis: The patient has NASH cirrhosis, and his liver function tests, bilirubin, and coagulation profile have not been elevated. An abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver flow without any signs of ascites.

6. Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a chronic wound care plan with daily packing, and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis based on an X-ray of the sac"

   Disposition:
","The patient has been intubated since December 25th and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 to 95/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving medications including fosphenytoin, furosemide, and dextrose 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and chloride. However, the patient has elevated glucose levels ranging from 162 to 209 mg/dL.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on invasive ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This may be due to the underlying condition or the patient's inability to maintain adequate breathing without mechanical support.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently low, which may indicate hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage if not managed appropriately.

3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes such as potassium and sodium, as well as abnormal fluid balance with a negative total fluid intake-output balance. These imbalances need to be corrected to prevent further complications.

4. Impaired skin integrity"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 year old gentleman with NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder and
   increasing debilitation continues in the ICU after a seizure.  He
   remains intubated for airway protection and unsuccessfully weaned from
   ventilation.
   # Respiratory failure:  Witnessed apnea during code and recent HCAP.
   Still requires ventilatory support for what appears to be pulmonary
   edema.  Tolerated PS trial in overnight, but still tachypneic with low
   tidal volumes
   - Lasix gtt to goal output of 1 liter by afternoon
   - Extubate this AM
   - Hold TF in anticipation of extubation
   - Sputum cultures positive for klebsiella, proteus, sensitive to
   meropenem, zosyn and tobra
   # Seizure disorder:  Finished phenytoin taper yesterday, and appears to
   have sz today
   - Give one time dose of Keppra, and some additional ativan
   - Keppra 2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Topamax 200mg PO BID
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved.
   - D/C free water flushes as attempting to reduce volume, will re-eval
   when starting TF
   - Check PM lytes given diuresis
   .
   # Hypogylcemia
   -  currently resolved and trending up.  Will hold insulin today as he
   has been sensitive, and not on TF given possible extubation
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Stable on exam.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG-Held
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PICC
   # Code: Full (confirmed w/ family)
   # Communication: Patient

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with a history of NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder, and increasing debilitation. He continues to be in the ICU after experiencing a seizure. The patient remains intubated for airway protection and has been unsuccessfully weaned from ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient still requires ventilatory support for what appears to be pulmonary edema. There is a need for ongoing monitoring and management of his respiratory status.

2. Seizure disorder: The patient appears to have had another seizure today despite finishing phenytoin taper yesterday. This indicates that further evaluation and management of his seizure disorder is necessary.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were elevated, but it has since resolved. Ongoing monitoring of electrolyte levels is important to prevent its recurrence.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia, which has been resolved. It is crucial to closely monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin administration accordingly.

5. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis due to NASH. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation profile is important to assess the progression of the disease.

6. Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a chronic wound care issue, specifically a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer. Proper wound care management is essential to prevent further complications"

   Still requires ventilatory support for what appears to be pulmonary
   edema.  Tolerated PS trial in AM, but still tachypneic
   - Lasix gtt to goal output of 1 liter by afternoon
   - Wean as tolerated, with hope to extubate this afternoon.
   - Hold TF in anticipation of extubation
   # Seizure disorder:  Keppra order had expired, will restart today.
   - Phenytoin taper- currently QD x3 days (ending [**2200-1-1**])
   - Keppra 2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Topamax 200mg PO BID
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved.
   - D/C free water flushes as attempting to reduce volume.
   - Check PM lytes given diuresis
   .
   # Hypogylcemia
   -  currently resolved and trending up.  Will give
 dose of insulin
   today as
 dose yesterday still made patient hypoglycemic and currently
   hold TF
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Stable on exam.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder, and increasing debilitation. He remains in the ICU after experiencing a seizure and unsuccessful weaning from ventilation. The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, seizure disorder, hypernatremia, cirrhosis, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition. The patient is currently on various medications and treatments for these conditions. He has been extubated without difficulty and will be transferred to the Neuro step-down unit today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure resolved after being intubated for airway protection and successfully extubated without difficulty. However, he remains on ventilatory support due to unsuccessful weaning attempts.
2. Seizure Disorder: The patient had seizure activity yesterday and overnight. Phenytoin has been restarted at a dose of 300mg per night, and other antiepileptic medications (Keppra, Topamax, Zonisamide) are being continued.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved. Diuretic free water flushes have been discontinued, and electrolyte levels will be checked due to ongoing diuresis.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 year old gentleman with NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder and
   increasing debilitation continues in the ICU after a seizure.  He
   remains intubated for airway protection and unsuccessfully weaned from
   ventilation.
   # Respiratory failure:  Witnessed apnea during code and recent HCAP.
   Still requires ventilatory support for what appears to be pulmonary
   edema.  Tolerated PS trial in overnight, but still tachypneic with low
   tidal volumes
   - Lasix gtt to goal output of 1 liter by afternoon
   - Extubate this AM
   - Hold TF in anticipation of extubation
   - Sputum cultures positive for klebsiella, proteus, sensitive to
   meropenem, zosyn and tobra
   # Seizure disorder:  Finished phenytoin taper yesterday, and appears to
   have sz today
   - Give one time dose of Keppra, and some additional ativan
   - Keppra 2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Topamax 200mg PO BID
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved.
   - D/C free water flushes as attempting to reduce volume, will re-eval
   when starting TF
   - Check PM lytes given diuresis
   .
   # Hypogylcemia
   -  currently resolved and trending up.  Will hold insulin today as he
   has been sensitive, and not on TF given possible extubation
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Stable on exam.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder, and increasing debilitation. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and has been unsuccessfully weaned from ventilation. He also has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient's recent medical events include hypoglycemia, alteration in nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, seizure, hypotension, oliguria/anuria, and hypernatremia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pulmonary edema. If not properly managed, this can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and recent witnessed seizure activity. If not adequately controlled, seizures can lead to further neurological damage and increase the risk of falls and other complications.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced hypoglycemia, which if not managed appropriately, can result in serious neurological complications.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte disorder, specifically hypernatremia. If left uncorrected, this can lead to dehydration, neurological dysfunction, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer. If not properly managed, this can progress to deeper tissue damage and increase the risk of infection.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia, characterized by low white blood cell count, low red blood cell count, and low platelet count, increases the risk of infections, bleeding, and anemia.
7. Hypothyroidism: If not treated, hypothyroidism can lead to a range of symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and cognitive impairment.
8. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure can worsen over time if not managed appropriately, leading to increased fluid retention, pulmonary congestion, and reduced cardiac output.
9. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease increases the risk of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events.
10. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, and long-term complications like nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was successfully extubated but remains on invasive ventilation due to persistent seizure activity, which is worsening per neuro assessment. Zonisamide was increased to 600 mg QD, and consideration is being given to a phenytoin load if the seizures do not improve. The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently receiving furosemide infusion at 10 mg/hour. Other medications include fosphenytoin and heparin sodium. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/59-116/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,084 mL with 524 mL given through PO, 1,594 mL through IVF, and 524 mL through NG. Total output includes 4,790 mL of blood products and 1,130 mL of urine. The overall fluid balance is -2,706 mL.

Respiratory support is provided through a face tent with PSV/SBT mode, set at a pressure support of 5 cmH2O. The patient's spontaneous tidal volume"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 year old gentleman with NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder and
   increasing debilitation continues in the ICU after a seizure.  He
   remains intubated for airway protection and unsuccessfully weaned from
   ventilation.
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved.  The patient had witnessed apnea
   during code and recent HCAP.  Extubated without difficulty.
   - Continue lasix gtt for diuresis
   - Sputum cultures positive for klebsiella, proteus, sensitive to
   meropenem, zosyn and tobra however most likely contaminent not
   infection
   # Seizure disorder:  The patient had seizure activity yesterday and
   overnight.  He had finished phenytoin taper, but Neurology recommended
   restarting phenytoin.
   - Load of phenytoin of 500mg, then start 300mg per night
   - Continue Keppra 2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue Topamax 200mg PO BID
   - Continue increased dose of Zonisamide
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved.
   - D/C
ed free water flushes yesterday
   - Check PM lytes given diuresis
   .
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose
   stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Stable on exam.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2:   The patient was having episodes of hypoglycemia, which have
   resolved.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - continue to trend
   - guaiac stools
   # Hypothyroid: continue levothyroxine
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG-Held

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder, and increasing debilitation. He is currently in the ICU after experiencing a seizure and remains intubated for airway protection. The patient's recent events include hypotension, restarted dilantin load, and likely acceptance in the morning. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/43 mmHg to 73/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, ETT in place, disconjugate gaze improved, subconjunctival hemorrhages bilaterally, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and warm well-perfused extremities with edema to midcalf. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, seizure disorder, hypernatremia, cirrhosis, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and fecal incontinence.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 year old gentleman with NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder and
   increasing debilitation continues in the ICU after a seizure.  He
   remains intubated for airway protection and unsuccessfully weaned from
   ventilation.
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved.  The patient had witnessed apnea
   during code and recent HCAP.  Extubated without difficulty.
   - Continue lasix gtt for diuresis
   - Sputum cultures positive for klebsiella, proteus, sensitive to
   meropenem, zosyn and tobra however most likely contaminent not
   infection
   # Hypotension:  Likely multifactorial including when the patient is
   sleeping and secondary to decreased intake and increased stool output.
   Not likely secondary to infectious process given no other sign of
   infection, no increased WBC, no fevers or tachycardia.
   -          Restart Tube feeds with free water flushes, and pull NG Tube
   -          Decrease lactulose to 15ml
   # Seizure disorder:  The patient has had intermittent seizure
   activity.  He had finished phenytoin taper, but Neurology recommended
   restarting phenytoin.
   - Loaded with phenytoin of 500mg, then started 300mg per night,
   switched today to 150mg TID and gave an additional 500mg [**Last Name (LF) 774**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]
   check level in AM
   - Continue Keppra 2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue Topamax 200mg PO BID
   - Continue increased dose of Zonisamide
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved.
   .
   # Cirrhosis: [**1-20**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - Continue lactulose at decreased dose and rifaxamin-suspect this is
   contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 102**].  Mild
   LVH.  Stable on exam.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2:   The patient was having episodes of hypoglycemia, which have
   resolved.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - continue to trend
   - guaiac stools
   # Hypothyroid: continue levothyroxine
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG-Held
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PICC
   # Code: Full (confirmed w/ family)
   # Communication: Patient
s Family
   # Disposition: will transfer the patient to the Neuro step down unit
