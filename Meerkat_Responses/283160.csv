   Multifocal areas of restricted diffusion corresponding to the areas of
   abnormality seen on CT consistent with acute infarction, which given
   distribution is most suggestive of an embolic source.

   Assessment and Plan
   <I>ASSESSMENT:</I>54F with DM, known CAD admitted with VT arrest,
   hospital course complicated by difficult ventilation initially now with
   persistent ventilator dependence, hypertension and now evidence of
   embolic CVA on CT scan new from admission.
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I>Pt with persistent high PEEP
   requirements, due to this SBT have not been attempted. When sedation
   decreased pt becomes too agitated to tolerate vent weaning.  Unclear
   etiology for ventilator dependence, possible component of CHF in
   setting of recent MI with VF arrest, aspiration pneumonitis after
   aspirating during her code, COBD/reactive airways No evidence for PE.
   Minimal evidence for infections, has completed abx, cultures are
   negative, CXR fairly benign.
   -attempt to decrease Fi02 and PEEP overnight
   -Taper steroids as rapidly as tolerated, caution with steroids/risk for
   polyneuropathy esp in vented ICU patient at risk for neuropathy.
   -Continue MDIs
   -Check BNP, diurese prn
   -Currently on zosyn for ? aspiration PNA, day [**4-17**](?)
   .
   <I>## Stroke:</I>Pt had head CT in setting of persistently labile blood
   pressures.  Evidence for embolic strokes new from [**8-15**] with lesions in
   left occipital lobe and cerebellum with small lesions in frontal lobe.
   -? PFO vs clot in LV, consider repeat TTE vs TEE with contrast bubbles
   to evaluate for source of emboli, also could have occured during cath.
   -Continue ASA
   -f/u neuro recs
   -Maintain goal SBP 140-160 with nicardipine gtt and antihypertensive
   regimen as outlined below.
   -Check MRI, if unable to get tonight, will need 6am CT to r/o
   herniation as occipital infarct likely to swell and herniate.
   -Q2 hour neuro checks.
   .
   <I>## Hypertension:</I>No evidence of RAS.
   -continue nifedipine gtt
   -captopril
   -Nitro gtt prn goal BP 140-160s
   .
   <I>## CAD:</I>s/p VF arrest, presumed in setting of MI, s/p stent to
   OM1.
   -no BB due to concern for bronchospasm, can re-try after extubation
   -ASA, statin, plavix
   .
   <I>## CHF:</I>TTE showed some recovery of cardiac function
   -Continue ACEI, no BB as outlined above
   -spironolactone, monitor K
   -check CXR and BNP
   -pt appears total body overloaded, has been autodiuresing since
   transfer, closely monitor I/Os, electrolytes and weights.  [**Month (only) 60**] need
   add'l diuresis, CHF may be playing a role in pt's difficulty with vent
   weaning.
   .
   <I>## DM:</I>Holding metformin for now.
   -RISS
   .
   <I>## ID:</I>Leukocytosis, low grade fevers on transfer
   -on zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   -Repeat blood cx and UA since febrile to 100.8 tonight, has sterile
   pyuria recently possibly in setting of ongoing abx tx.
   -change foley

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM) and known coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted with ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest. The hospital course has been complicated by difficult ventilation initially, now with persistent ventilator dependence, hypertension, and evidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on CT scan since admission.

The patient's recent medical history includes a myocardial infarction (MI) with ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, for which she underwent stenting of the left omohyoid artery (OM1). She also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ischemic heart disease (IHD).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 153/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and sedated, with limited neurological function.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and blood glucose levels. Other notable lab results include an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin-T levels.

   distribution is most suggestive of an embolic source.
   No new culture data
   TEE Prelim report:
   The left atrium is normal in size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left
   atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent
   foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
   maneuvers. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for a ventricular tachycardia arrest. She has had a difficult time with ventilation and is still dependent on the ventilator. The patient also has hypertension and evidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident (stroke) on the CT scan.

24-hour events:
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed areas of restricted diffusion consistent with acute infarction, suggesting an embolic source.
- Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not reveal any left atrial thrombus but showed complex atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
- The patient tolerated weaning down pressure support and is currently at 10 cmH2O.
- TEE also showed no evidence of atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale.
- Blood cultures were negative.
- The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 50%.
- ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 194.
- Physical examination reveals intubation, a flushed face, sclera anicteric, and mild abdominal distension.
- Lab results indicate elevated WBC count, slightly low platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels.
- MRI and TEE reports are consistent with multifocal areas of restricted diffusion corresponding to acute infarction, most suggestive of an embolic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and cough. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Upon admission, he was intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is currently weaning off pressure support. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's urine output has been high but has slowed down recently. Neurology suggests performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out left ventricular thrombus and the patient will remain intubated for this procedure today. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including nicardipine, propofol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and lorazepam. 

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate ranging from 73 to 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90 to 153/47 to 64 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14 to 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a central venous pressure of 5 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,142 mL and output of 5,595 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -3,453 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   <I>ASSESSMENT:</I>54F with DM, known CAD admitted with VT arrest,
   hospital course complicated by difficult ventilation initially now with
   persistent ventilator dependence, hypertension and now evidence of
   embolic CVA on CT scan new from admission.
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I>Pt with persistent high PEEP
   requirements, due to this SBT have not been attempted. When sedation
   decreased pt becomes too agitated to tolerate vent weaning.  Unclear
   etiology for ventilator dependence, possible component of CHF in
   setting of recent MI with VF arrest, aspiration pneumonitis after
   aspirating during her code, COBD/reactive airways No evidence for PE.
   Minimal evidence for infections, has completed abx, cultures are
   negative, CXR fairly benign.
   -attempt to decrease Fi02 and PEEP overnight
   -Taper steroids as rapidly as tolerated, caution with steroids/risk for
   polyneuropathy esp in vented ICU patient at risk for neuropathy.
   -Continue MDIs
   -Check BNP, diurese prn
   -Currently on zosyn for ? aspiration PNA, day [**4-17**](?)
   .
   <I>## Stroke:</I>Pt had head CT in setting of persistently labile blood
   pressures.  Evidence for embolic strokes new from [**8-15**] with lesions in
   left occipital lobe and cerebellum with small lesions in frontal lobe.
   -? PFO vs clot in LV, consider repeat TTE vs TEE with contrast bubbles
   to evaluate for source of emboli, also could have occured during cath.
   -Continue ASA
   -f/u neuro recs
   -Maintain goal SBP 140-160 with nicardipine gtt and antihypertensive
   regimen as outlined below.
   -Check MRI, if unable to get tonight, will need 6am CT to r/o
   herniation as occipital infarct likely to swell and herniate.
   -Q2 hour neuro checks.
   .
   <I>## Hypertension:</I>No evidence of RAS.
   -continue nifedipine gtt
   -captopril
   -Nitro gtt prn goal BP 140-160s
   .
   <I>## CAD:</I>s/p VF arrest, presumed in setting of MI, s/p stent to
   OM1.
   -no BB due to concern for bronchospasm, can re-try after extubation
   -ASA, statin, plavix
   .
   <I>## CHF:</I>TTE showed some recovery of cardiac function
   -Continue ACEI, no BB as outlined above
   -spironolactone, monitor K
   -check CXR and BNP
   -pt appears total body overloaded, has been autodiuresing since
   transfer, closely monitor I/Os, electrolytes and weights.  [**Month (only) 60**] need
   add'l diuresis, CHF may be playing a role in pt's difficulty with vent
   weaning.
   .
   <I>## DM:</I>Holding metformin for now.
   -RISS
   .
   <I>## ID:</I>Leukocytosis, low grade fevers on transfer
   -on zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   -Repeat blood cx and UA since febrile to 100.8 tonight, has sterile

","Summary:
- The patient presented with a ventricular fibrillation arrest and subsequent cardiogenic shock, leading to acute respiratory failure and intubation.
- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and extensive atherosclerosis in the aortic arch and descending aorta.
- The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving various medications including nicardipine, propofol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and midazolam.
- Vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and mild hypoxemia.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 83 and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%.
- Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated troponin T, and elevated lactate levels.
- Imaging shows an acute infarct consistent with an embolic source.
- The patient is critically ill, with ongoing management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: Due to the patient's COPD exacerbation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of pneumonia, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of ventricular fibrillation arrest and extensive atherosclerosis, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a complex medical history. The chief complaint is vfib arrest, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has experienced multiple medical complications and interventions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Acute CVA: The patient has had a recent stroke, which is likely due to atheroembolic peri-catheterization. The stroke consult team is against anticoagulation due to severe hypertension.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is associated with COPD exacerbation. There is a possibility of weaning off from mechanical ventilation if the patient's condition stabilizes.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has significant coronary artery disease, and measures such as aspirin (ASA), statin therapy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) are being implemented.

4. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient is on the last day of antibiotic therapy for pneumonia. All cultures obtained thus far have been negative.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to immobility and critical illness. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous low"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus and known coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) arrest. The hospital course has been complicated by difficult ventilation initially, persistent ventilator dependence, hypertension, and evidence of embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on CT scan. The patient has been intubated, sedated, and receiving invasive ventilation. She is also on multiple medications including antibiotics, antihypertensives, antiplatelet agents, statins, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on the ventilator and there is a plan to extubate her once her respiratory status improves. The plan includes decreasing PEEP, checking ABG after an hour, and if it is within normal limits, turning off sedation and attempting extubation.
2. Stroke: The patient had evidence of embolic strokes with lesions in the left occipital lobe, cerebellum, and frontal lobe. The transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not show any left ventricular thrombus but revealed significant aortic atherosclerosis, which is a strong contender for the embolic etiology. The plan includes continuing aspirin (ASA) and considering anticoagulation at any point.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being maintained at 140-160"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM) and known coronary artery disease (CAD) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) arrest. The hospital course has been complicated by difficult ventilation initially, persistent ventilator dependence, hypertension, and now evidence of embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on CT scan.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is doing well with minimal oxygen requirement. However, she still has wheezing on examination, which is suspected to be bronchospasm from recent aspiration. The plan is to decrease steroids tomorrow to 40mg daily, switch albuterol to nebs, and continue zosyn for aspiration pneumonia.

2. Stroke: The patient had a head CT that showed evidence of embolic strokes with lesions in the left occipital lobe and cerebellum, as well as small lesions in the frontal lobe. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed, which did not reveal any evidence of left ventricular thrombus but did show significant aortic atherosclerosis.

   atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses
   or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
   regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen. Complex atheroma in the
   descending aorta. The aortic arch was not well visualized but probably
   also has atheroma.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM) and known coronary artery disease (CAD) admitted to the ICU for ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest. The hospital course has been complicated by difficult ventilation initially, persistent ventilator dependence, hypertension, and evidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on CT scan.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 143/64 to 174/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula, and a CVP of 8 mmHg.

The patient is intubated and sedated, with limited neurological examination due to the sedation. Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, mild distention of the abdomen, anasarca (generalized swelling), and telangiectasias on the chest.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.7, slightly elevated glucose levels, elevated troponin-T levels, and normal kidney function. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of a cardiac source of embolism, but there was complex atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current health status, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Right-sided visual field deficit: The patient is experiencing some right-sided visual field deficit. This may indicate a neurological issue or an injury to the visual pathways in the brain.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient's ECG changes and the use of nitroglycerin suggest underlying cardiac issues. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and function closely for any signs of cardiac complications.

3. Respiratory support: The patient is still receiving respiratory support through CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, indicating ongoing respiratory distress or impaired lung function. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to prevent further respiratory complications.

4. Infection risk: The elevated white blood cell count (WBC) suggests an ongoing infection or inflammation in the body. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and symptoms is necessary to identify and manage any potential infections promptly.

5. Coagulation abnormalities: The prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and low international normalized ratio (INR) indicate a potential bleeding risk due to impaired blood clotting. Monitoring for signs of bleeding or abnormal bleeding patterns is essential.

6. Fluid balance: The fluid balance sheet shows an overall negative fluid balance, indicating ongoing fluid losses. Careful monitoring and management of fluid administration and output are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unspecified medical condition. They have been receiving invasive ventilation since [**2119-8-23**] 12:15 PM. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.1 C (97 F), heart rate of 93 bpm with a range of 75-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/53 mmHg to 170/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with a range of 13-22, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is on a nasogastric tube and receiving multiple medications including nicardipine, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on invasive ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular chest X-rays may be necessary to detect any signs of infection.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT, which may lead to a potentially life-threatening PE if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs. Prophylactic measures such as intermittent compression devices and early mobilization should be implemented.

3. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged stay in"

   ## Respiratory failure: Succesfully extubated yesterday. Doing well
   with minimal 02 requirement. Still with wheezing on exam, while has a
   history of COPD, suspect current wheeze is bronchospasm from recent
   aspiration.
   -Decrease steroids tomorrow to 40mg daily
   -Switch albuterol to nebs
   -Currently on zosyn for  aspiration PNA, day [**6-11**]

   pressures.  Evidence for embolic strokes new from [**8-15**] with lesions in
   left occipital lobe and cerebellum with small lesions in frontal lobe.
   -TEE with no evidence LV thrombus, did see evidence of significant
   aortic atherosclerosis which is strong contender for embolic etiology
   -Continue [**Month/Year (2) 369**]

   today keeping BPs 140-160s
   -captopril 75 TID
   -Start PO HCTZ today in attempt to wean off nicardipine
   -d/c a-line
   .
   ## CAD: s/p VF arrest, presumed in setting of MI, s/p stent to OM1.
   -no BB due to concern for bronchospasm, can re-try after wheezing
   resolves
   -[**First Name3 (LF) 369**], statin, [**First Name3 (LF) 1495**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, known coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of COPD. She was admitted with a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest and had a difficult initial ventilation due to aspiration. She now shows signs of persistent ventilator dependence, hypertension, and evidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on CT scan.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, as she successfully extubated yesterday but still experiences wheezing on exam. Her steroids are being decreased tomorrow to 40mg daily, and she will switch from albuterol to nebulized treatments. She has been on Zosyn for aspiration pneumonia for the past six days.

Regarding the stroke, the patient had a head CT showing evidence of embolic strokes with lesions in the left occipital lobe and cerebellum, as well as small lesions in the frontal lobe. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed significant aortic atherosclerosis, which is a strong contender for the embolic etiology. The plan is to follow up with neurologic recommendations, expect continued improvement in right upper extremity functioning, and unlikely recovery of visual field deficit. No plan for anticoagulation has been made, but it is okay to continue with current anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's hypertension is being managed by maintaining goal systolic blood pressure"

- She was admitted with ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest, which required resuscitation and intubation.
- The patient's hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, hypertension, and evidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on CT scan.
- She has been successfully extubated but remains dependent on the ventilator.
- The patient has shown signs of leukocytosis, low-grade fevers, and an increase in white blood cell count despite tapering down of steroids.
- There are plans to obtain cultures from arterial and central venous lines, as well as a CT abdomen to evaluate for possible mesenteric ischemia.
- No evidence of renal artery stenosis (RAS) has been found.
- The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the right omohyoid artery (OM1) due to presumed myocardial infarction (MI).
- Her transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed some recovery of cardiac function.

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. However, there are several important events documented:

1. EKG at 05:31 PM on [**2119-8-24**]
2. Arterial line stop at 06:58 PM on [**2119-8-24**]
3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at 10:00 PM on [**2119-8-24**]

The patient had chest pain (CP) yesterday without any EKG changes. An MRI of the thorax was performed to rule out aortic dissection, especially considering the patient's history of diabetes, large blood pressure difference between arms, CP, and poorly controlled blood pressure. The preliminary read was negative for dissection.

The patient started on HCTZ (a diuretic) and received prn (as needed) ativan and simethicone for abdominal pain, which provided good relief.

The patient has allergies to codeine and an unknown allergen. The last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) given at 12:38 AM on [**2119-8-25**].

Infusions include nicardipine at 1.3 mcg/Kg/min and heparin sodium for prophylaxis, also started at 12:38 AM on [**2119-8-25**]. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old diabetic male admitted to the ICU with an acute onset of chest pain and suspected aortic dissection. The patient has a history of poorly controlled blood pressure and a large blood pressure difference between arms. An MRI of the thorax was performed to rule out aortic dissection, but preliminary results are negative. The patient is currently on several medications including HCTZ, Nicardipine, Pantoprazole, and Heparin Sodium.

Vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate between 74-108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128-168/48-81 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm with a central venous pressure of 11 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,643 mL and output of 4,140 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,497 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels have been consistently high. Other lab values such as creatinine, TCO2, and calcium are within normal ranges. The patient's PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, while CK/CKMB/Troponin-T levels are within normal limits.

   Disposition :ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and known coronary artery disease (CAD). She was admitted with a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest and had a hospital course complicated by aspiration and subsequent difficulty with ventilation, hypertension, and evidence of embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on CT scan.

The patient is currently experiencing rising white blood cell (WBC) count, low-grade fevers, and new abdominal pain on steroids. These symptoms are concerning for an abdominal process given the patient's use of steroids and embolic disease. A CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast has been ordered, and the central line will be pulled and cultured. Stool samples will also be sent for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and occult blood.

In terms of medical complications, the patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Infection: The patient has an elevated WBC count, low-grade fevers, and abdominal pain, which could indicate an infection. Further investigation with cultures, a chest X-ray, and a CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is necessary to identify the source of infection.

2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD needs to be managed appropriately. This may involve restarting low-dose beta-blockers and following for signs of reactive airway disease. Medications such as aspirin (ASA) and Plavix should also be continued.

3. Respiratory: Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, continued nebulizer treatments (nebs) and steroid tapering are recommended.

4. Renal: The patient is being diuresed off spironolactone, indicating a need for renal management and possibly adjustment of fluid balance.

5. Neurological: The patient has had an embolic CVA, and appropriate management for stroke includes continuing ASA and Plavix, pain control, and physical therapy consultation.

6. Feeding: The patient's diet has been advanced to provide adequate nutrition.

7. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care: The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and pneumonia. Communication with the patient and her husband is essential, and the patient's code status is full code. The disposition is currently the ICU pending the CT abdomen."
