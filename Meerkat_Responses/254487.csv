   Assessment and Plan
 FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER
   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was likely 'cold' and 'wet' from a heart failure
   perspective, with severe volume overload and poor forward flow,
   resulting in hypoperfusion, liver shock, renal failure, possible
   ischemic colitis and now very decompensated heart failure with about 10
   kg of additional volume, poorly responsive to Lasix and transferred to
   the CCU for more agressive diuresis.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.</i>
   Decompensated at present, worsened over the course of admission so far.
   Now non-responsive to Lasix and transferred for vasodilator, milrinone,
   Lasix and pressor treatment to attempt diuresis. Again, nonresponsive
   to inotropes, milrinone and Correction of volume overload will likely
   improve systolic function and MR.
   - Would recommend restarting Lasix at 12 mg/hr gtt and uptitrating once
   PICC line is placed
   - Would recommend STARTING Dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min (renal dosing)
   - Would recommend HOLDING Milrinone
   - Wean off phenylephrine now that Dopamine is on board
   - Renal recs re CVVH although pt has been hesitant re this
   - Recall palliative care to help readdress goals of care (pt has been
   quite ambivalent on her goals of care)
   - Hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic dopamine
   - Avoid albuterol
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
     Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin in present setting (GIB and elevated INR)
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   - ICD not an option given DNR status and wishes to die peacefully
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Could be responsible for chest pressure,
   although ischemia and stomach or other organs possible. Chest pressure
   had possibly been coincident with SVT and therefore possible that pain
   was strain and ischemia.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow, somewhat decompensated (though not as severely as
   now) with poor PO intake also. Also rapid ventricular rates may have
   contributed. Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures in 80s at
   clinic).
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine normalizing now that cardiogenic shock resolved. Possible
   prerenal component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with
   intravascular depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I but can restart if BP can tolerate
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   - Trend LFTs
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - Switch IV PPI (pantoprazole) to PO (omeprazole)
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Consider restarting xopenex now that milrinone has been discontinued
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, INR elevated - previously on coumadin and
   now thought to have shock liver.
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, lactulose.
   Access: 2 peripherals
   Communication: Patient
   CODE: DNR/DNI - BUT if in malignant rhythm, okay to shock if she can
   get midazolam. No breathing tube or chest compressions (see OMR note
   [**5-12**] by PCP [**Doctor Last Name **] for full discussion).
     Ms [**Known lastname 14467**] has been very clear on multiple occasions that she feels
   so uncomfortable in recent months she accepts mortality if this happens
   naturally. She wishes to pass away at home rather than in a hospital or
   nursing home and to be comfortable at that time. She has had aversion
   to ""hospice care"" and even rehab in the past though states she wishes
   to be comfortable and is tired of being so uncomfortable. She is aware
   she has severe cardiopulmonary disease. Unfortunately she lives in pain
   as she has been unable to tolerate multiple pain medications.
   - is DNR/DNI (compressions/intubation/cardiopulmonary support not
   appropriate)

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure, mitral regurgitation, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. She was admitted with symptoms of dyspnea and found to have severe volume overload, leading to hypoperfusion, liver shock, renal failure, and ischemic colitis. The patient's condition has deteriorated over the course of admission and she is now in the critical care unit (CCU) for aggressive diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is decompensated, and she has poor forward flow with significant volume overload. This can lead to further hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels. If not managed properly, this can progress to chronic renal failure.
3. Hepatitis: The patient had elevated liver enzymes indicating hepatitis, which may be due to shock liver or another underlying cause. Monitoring liver function is important.
4. Ischemic Colitis: The patient likely has ischemic colitis, as evidenced by abdominal pain and guaiac-positive stools. This condition requires monitoring and management.
5. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient experienced tachyarrhythmias, specifically supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Monitoring on telemetry is necessary, and medications such as metoprolol and amiodarone have been started.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea. She has a history of multiple medical conditions and allergies. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including diuretics, blood transfusions, and consideration for dialysis. Her vital signs are stable, but she experienced hypotension earlier. Fluid balance and respiratory support are being monitored closely. The patient's lab results show some abnormalities, such as elevated potassium levels and decreased hemoglobin. Imaging reveals no hydronephrosis and limited Doppler examination of the kidneys. The patient has a fungal infection and is being managed for heart failure. She is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating that she does not wish to be resuscitated and wishes to refrain from invasive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, some potential medical complications that could arise include worsening heart failure, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, infections, and complications related to the patient's allergies. It is crucial to monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and lab results closely to identify and manage these complications promptly."

   Assessment and Plan
 FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER
   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was likely 'cold' and 'wet' from a heart failure
   perspective, with severe volume overload and poor forward flow,
   resulting in hypoperfusion, liver shock, renal failure, possible
   ischemic colitis and now very decompensated heart failure with about 10
   kg of additional volume, poorly responsive to Lasix and transferred to
   the CCU for more agressive diuresis.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.</i>
   Decompensated at present, worsened over the course of admission so far.
   Now non-responsive to Lasix and transferred for vasodilator, milrinone,
   Lasix and pressor treatment to attempt diuresis. Again, nonresponsive
   to inotropes, milrinone and Correction of volume overload will likely
   improve systolic function and MR.
   - Would recommend restarting Lasix at 12 mg/hr gtt and uptitrating once
   PICC line is placed
   - Would recommend STARTING Dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min (renal dosing)
   - Would recommend HOLDING Milrinone
   - Wean off phenylephrine now that Dopamine is on board
   - Renal recs re CVVH although pt has been hesitant re this
   - Recall palliative care to help readdress goals of care (pt has been
   quite ambivalent on her goals of care)
   - Hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic dopamine
   - Avoid albuterol
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
     Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin in present setting (GIB and elevated INR)
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   - ICD not an option given DNR status and wishes to die peacefully
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Could be responsible for chest pressure,
   although ischemia and stomach or other organs possible. Chest pressure
   had possibly been coincident with SVT and therefore possible that pain
   was strain and ischemia.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow, somewhat decompensated (though not as severely as
   now) with poor PO intake also. Also rapid ventricular rates may have
   contributed. Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures in 80s at
   clinic).
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine normalizing now that cardiogenic shock resolved. Possible
   prerenal component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with
   intravascular depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I but can restart if BP can tolerate
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   - Trend LFTs
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - Switch IV PPI (pantoprazole) to PO (omeprazole)
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Consider restarting xopenex now that milrinone has been discontinued
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, INR elevated - previously on coumadin and
   now thought to have shock liver.
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, lactulose.

     Ms [**Known lastname 14467**] has been very clear on multiple occasions that she feels
   so uncomfortable in recent months she accepts mortality if this happens
   naturally. She wishes to pass away at home rather than in a hospital or
   nursing home and to be comfortable at that time. She has had aversion
   to ""hospice care"" and even rehab in the past though states she wishes
   to be comfortable and is tired of being so uncomfortable. She is aware
   she has severe cardiopulmonary disease. Unfortunately she lives in pain
   as she has been unable to tolerate multiple pain medications.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of multiple medical conditions including heart failure, mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease, tachyarrhythmia, NSTEMI, renal failure, hepatitis, abdominal pain, anxiety, and heel pain. She is currently admitted to the ICU for aggressive diuresis due to severe volume overload and poor forward flow resulting in hypoperfusion, liver shock, renal failure, and ischemic colitis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/45 to 142/122 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals mild dyspnea, alert and oriented mood, supple neck, enlarged point of maximal impulse (PMI), normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without murmurs, rales, or lifts, some kyphosis, labored respirations with very poor air entry and no breath sounds at the bases, wheezes and ronchi above, slightly distended abdomen with palpable stool in the large bowel on the right, mild tenderness particularly in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), very severe lower extremity edema, cool extremities, and mild statis dermatitis. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was likely 'cold' and 'wet' from a heart failure
   perspective, with severe volume overload and poor forward flow,
   resulting in hypoperfusion, liver shock, renal failure, possible
   ischemic colitis and now very decompensated heart failure with about 10
   kg of additional volume, poorly responsive to Lasix and transferred to
   the CCU for more agressive diuresis.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.</i>
   Decompensated at present, worsened over the course of admission so far.
   Now non-responsive to Lasix and transferred for vasodilator, milrinone,
   Lasix and pressor treatment to attempt diuresis. Again, nonresponsive
   to inotropes, milrinone and Correction of volume overload will likely
   improve systolic function and MR.
   - Would recommend restarting Lasix at 12 mg/hr gtt and uptitrating once
   PICC line is placed
   - Would recommend restarting Milrinone, 50 mcg/kg bolus then infusion
   at 0.375 to 0.5
   - Phenylephrine as required to maintain systolics between 90 and 100
   mmHg, however needs PICC line first to receive pressor
   - Renal recs re CVVH although pt has been hesitant re this
   - Recall palliative care to help readdress goals of care
   - Hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic milrinone
   - Avoid albuterol
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
     Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin in present setting (GIB and elevated INR)
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   - ICD not an option given DNR status and wishes to die peacefully
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Could be responsible for chest pressure,
   although ischemia and stomach or other organs possible. Chest pressure
   had possibly been coincident with SVT and therefore possible that pain
   was strain and ischemia.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow, somewhat decompensated (though not as severely as
   now) with poor PO intake also. Also rapid ventricular rates may have
   contributed. Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures in 80s at
   clinic).
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine normalizing now that cardiogenic shock resolved. Possible
   prerenal component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with
   intravascular depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I but can restart if BP can tolerate
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   - Trend LFTs
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - Switch IV PPI (pantoprazole) to PO (omeprazole)
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Hold xepenex given milrinone (concern for arhythmia)
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, INR elevated - previously on coumadin and
   now thought to have shock liver.
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, lactulose.

   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was likely 'cold' and 'wet' from a heart failure
   perspective, with severe volume overload and poor forward flow,
   resulting in hypoperfusion, liver shock, renal failure, possible
   ischemic colitis and now very decompensated heart failure with about 10
   kg of additional volume, poorly responsive to Lasix and transferred to
   the CCU for more agressive diuresis.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.</i>
   Decompensated at present, worsened over the course of admission so far.
   Now non-responsive to Lasix and transferred for vasodilator, milrinone,
   Lasix and pressor treatment to attempt diuresis. Again, nonresponsive
   to inotropes, milrinone and Correction of volume overload will likely
   improve systolic function and MR.
   - Would recommend restarting Lasix at 12 mg/hr gtt and uptitrating once
   PICC line is placed
   - Would recommend restarting Milrinone, 50 mcg/kg bolus then infusion
   at 0.375 to 0.5
   - Phenylephrine as required to maintain systolics between 90 and 100
   mmHg, however needs PICC line first to receive pressor
   - Renal recs re CVVH
   - Hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic milrinone
   - Avoid albuterol
   - strict I/O and daily weights

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of multiple medical conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart failure (diastolic), tachyarrhythmia, NSTEMI, renal failure, hepatitis, abdominal pain, obstructive lung disease, allergic rhinitis, anxiety, and heel pain. She presented with dyspnea and was found to have severe volume overload and poor forward flow, resulting in hypoperfusion, liver shock, renal failure, and possible ischemic colitis. The patient has been decompensated and unresponsive to diuretics. She has a DNR/DNI code status and wishes to pass away at home. The patient is currently in the CCU for aggressive diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's decompensated heart failure may lead to further fluid accumulation and hypoperfusion.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's subacute renal failure could progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.
3. Ischemic Colitis: The patient's abdominal pain and guaiac positive stools suggest ischemic colitis, which can worsen if not treated promptly.
4. Hepatitis: The patient's resolving hepatitis may relapse if not monitored closely.
5. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient's history of tachyarrhythmia increases the risk of recurrent arrhythmias.

   Assessment and Plan
 FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER
   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was likely 'cold' and 'wet' from a heart failure
   perspective, with severe volume overload and poor forward flow,
   resulting in hypoperfusion, liver shock, renal failure, possible
   ischemic colitis and now very decompensated heart failure with about 10
   kg of additional volume, poorly responsive to Lasix and transferred to
   the CCU for more agressive diuresis.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.</i>
   Decompensated at present, worsened over the course of admission so far.
   Now non-responsive to Lasix and transferred for vasodilator, milrinone,
   Lasix and pressor treatment to attempt diuresis. Again, nonresponsive
   to inotropes, milrinone and Correction of volume overload will likely
   improve systolic function and MR.
   - Would recommend restarting Lasix at 12 mg/hr gtt and uptitrating once
   PICC line is placed
   - Would recommend STARTING Dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min (renal dosing)
   - Would recommend HOLDING Milrinone
   - Wean off phenylephrine now that Dopamine is on board
   - Renal recs re CVVH although pt has been hesitant re this
   - Recall palliative care to help readdress goals of care
   - Hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic dopamine
   - Avoid albuterol
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
     Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin in present setting (GIB and elevated INR)
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   - ICD not an option given DNR status and wishes to die peacefully
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Could be responsible for chest pressure,
   although ischemia and stomach or other organs possible. Chest pressure
   had possibly been coincident with SVT and therefore possible that pain
   was strain and ischemia.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow, somewhat decompensated (though not as severely as
   now) with poor PO intake also. Also rapid ventricular rates may have
   contributed. Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures in 80s at
   clinic).
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine normalizing now that cardiogenic shock resolved. Possible
   prerenal component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with
   intravascular depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I but can restart if BP can tolerate
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   - Trend LFTs
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - Switch IV PPI (pantoprazole) to PO (omeprazole)
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Consider restarting xopenex now that milrinone has been discontinued
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, INR elevated - previously on coumadin and
   now thought to have shock liver.
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, lactulose.

     Ms [**Known lastname 14467**] has been very clear on multiple occasions that she feels
   so uncomfortable in recent months she accepts mortality if this happens
   naturally. She wishes to pass away at home rather than in a hospital or
   nursing home and to be comfortable at that time. She has had aversion
   to ""hospice care"" and even rehab in the past though states she wishes
   to be comfortable and is tired of being so uncomfortable. She is aware
   she has severe cardiopulmonary disease. Unfortunately she lives in pain

","Summary:
The patient presented with hypotension, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, and a sore right heel. The patient became fluid overloaded and was transferred to the CCU for diuresis after diuresis failed on the floor. The patient declined to undergo TEE, met with palliative care, expressed interest in going home with hospice, requested the use of home nebs, and trialed albuterol. The patient also requested morphine and was started on heparin gtt. Good urine output was achieved with dopamine/Lasix. Renal issues were addressed, and the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for intravascular volume. Possible dialysis/ultrafiltration was evaluated for the next day but not initiated due to the patient's reluctance. The patient's blood pressure dropped to 60s systolic (assymptomatic), so milrinone was decreased and epi was uptitrated, resulting in stable pressures. A PICC line was started in the morning.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Fungal infection: The patient has a positive MRSA screen, indicating a possible fungal infection.
2. Heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute on chronic: The patient has moderate cardiomegaly, which suggests heart failure. The presence of bilateral pleural effusions also supports this diagnosis.
3. Constipation:"

   ECG: .
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was likely 'cold' and 'wet' from a heart failure
   perspective, with severe volume overload and poor forward flow,
   resulting in hypoperfusion, liver shock, renal failure, possible
   ischemic colitis and now very decompensated heart failure with about 10
   kg of additional volume, poorly responsive to Lasix and transferred to
   the CCU for more agressive diuresis.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.</i>
   Decompensated at present, worsened over the course of admission so far.
   Now non-responsive to Lasix and transferred for vasodilator, milrinone,
   Lasix and pressor treatment to attempt diuresis. Again, nonresponsive
   to inotropes, milrinone and Correction of volume overload will likely
   improve systolic function and MR.
   - Would recommend restarting Lasix at 12 mg/hr gtt and uptitrating once
   PICC line is placed
   - Would recommend STARTING Dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min (renal dosing)
   - Would recommend HOLDING Milrinone
   - Wean off phenylephrine now that Dopamine is on board
   - Renal recs re CVVH although pt has been hesitant re this
   - Recall palliative care to help readdress goals of care (pt has been
   quite ambivalent on her goals of care)
   - Hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic dopamine
   - Avoid albuterol
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
     Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin in present setting (GIB and elevated INR)
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   - ICD not an option given DNR status and wishes to die peacefully
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Could be responsible for chest pressure,
   although ischemia and stomach or other organs possible. Chest pressure
   had possibly been coincident with SVT and therefore possible that pain
   was strain and ischemia.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow, somewhat decompensated (though not as severely as
   now) with poor PO intake also. Also rapid ventricular rates may have
   contributed. Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures in 80s at
   clinic).
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine normalizing now that cardiogenic shock resolved. Possible
   prerenal component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with
   intravascular depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I but can restart if BP can tolerate
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   - Trend LFTs
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - Switch IV PPI (pantoprazole) to PO (omeprazole)
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Consider restarting xopenex now that milrinone has been discontinued
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, INR elevated - previously on coumadin and
   now thought to have shock liver.
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, lactulose.

   to ""hospice care"" and even rehab in the past though states she wishes
   to be comfortable and is tired of being so uncomfortable. She is aware
   she has severe cardiopulmonary disease. Unfortunately she lives in pain

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, mitral regurgitation, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. She presented with hypotension, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, and a sore right heel. The patient's condition has progressively worsened, leading to severe volume overload, poor forward flow, liver shock, renal failure, and ischemic colitis. She was transferred to the CCU for aggressive diuresis but remains non-responsive to Lasix and other treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has decompensated heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. This can lead to further hypotension, pulmonary edema, and worsening renal function.
2. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a history of tachyarrhythmia, which may recur due to her underlying coronary artery disease and decreased cardiac function. This can result in palpitations, chest pain, and potential hemodynamic instability.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a long-standing history of CAD, which can cause angina, myocardial infarction, or other cardiac events. These events can lead to further cardiac dysfunction and complications.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury on top of chronic kidney disease. This can result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload"

   ECG & telemetry
 no tachyarythmia overnight, EKG pending from this
   a.m.
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of
   30%.Decompensated at present, worsened over the course of admission so
   previously, now finally progress with reduced JVP and increased urine
   output with dopamine, lasix, phenylephrine. Previously no output to
   milrinone, lasix and phenylephrine. Will now continue diuresis with
   gentle goals off
 it is apparent that she is depleting intravascularly
   without good fluid shift from extravascular spaces given clinical
   observation of slowly improving edema and rapidly decreasing JVP.
   However, her blood pressure (now off pressor) indicates that she is
   tolerating this degree of diuresis.
   - Continue Lasix at 20 mg/hr for now, checking regularly throughout the
   day to adjust downward if pressure drops
   - Continue dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min (now good urine output at 1
   mcg/kg/min)
   - Hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic dopamine
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
     Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started. ICD not consistent with her goals of care.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Can restart albuterol now that she has been stably free of
   tachyarrhythmia on Amiodarone and metoprolol
   - Restart Coumadin now INR 1.8
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Could be responsible for chest pressure,
   although ischemia and stomach or other organs possible. Chest pressure
   had possibly been coincident with SVT and therefore possible that pain
   was strain and ischemia.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow, somewhat decompensated (though not as severely as
   now) with poor PO intake also. Also rapid ventricular rates may have
   contributed. Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures in 80s at
   clinic).
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary (not presently)
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine normalizing now that cardiogenic shock resolved. Possible
   prerenal component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of worsening heart failure due to mitral regurgitation. She presented with hypotension, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, and a sore right heel. The patient was initially fluid overloaded and required diuresis in the CCU after failing on the floor. Diuretics were unsuccessful with milrinone and Lasix, but dopamine was successful in improving urine output. The patient has a PICC line in place and has declined to undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). She has expressed interest in going home with hospice care if she can improve her ability to transfer before discharge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's history of worsening heart failure due to mitral regurgitation puts her at risk for further decompensation and fluid overload.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's subacute renal failure may worsen if not properly managed with fluid balance and medication adjustments.
3. Hepatitis: The patient's resolving hepatitis may continue to affect liver function and could potentially lead to hepatic encephalopathy or other complications.
4. Tachyarrhythmias: The patient's history of tachyarrhythmias may recur, particularly given the use of dopamine, which can be proarrhythmic.
5. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain could be due to ischemic heart disease or gastritis. Further evaluation is"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of
   30%.Decompensated at present.  Previously no output to milrinone, lasix
   and phenylephrine. Stopped milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and
   phenylephrine and had good UOP to this (3.6 L).  Pt is still volume
   overloaded with peripheral edema, but JVP no longer elevated. BP has
   been on the low side, limiting amount of diuresis possible.
   - decrease rate of lasix gtt for gentler diuresis (goal 1-1.5 L
   negative)
   - Continue dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min
   - Continue to hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic dopamine
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started. ICD not consistent with her goals of care.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow.  Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures
   in 80s at clinic). Diuresis also heavily contributing.
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary with lasix gtt
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0. Possible prerenal
   component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - repeat stool guiuac
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT Coumadin
   -Pain management with morphine PRN

   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of
   30%.Decompensated at present, worsened over the course of admission so
   previously, now finally progress with reduced JVP and increased urine
   output with dopamine, lasix, phenylephrine. Previously no output to
   milrinone, lasix and phenylephrine. Will now continue diuresis with
   gentle goals off
 it is apparent that she is depleting intravascularly
   without good fluid shift from extravascular spaces given clinical
   observation of slowly improving edema and rapidly decreasing JVP.
   However, her blood pressure (now off pressor) indicates that she is
   tolerating this degree of diuresis.
   - Continue Lasix at 20 mg/hr for now, checking regularly throughout the
   day to adjust downward if pressure drops
   - Continue dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min (now good urine output at 1
   mcg/kg/min)
   - Hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic dopamine
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
     Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started. ICD not consistent with her goals of care.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Can restart albuterol now that she has been stably free of
   tachyarrhythmia on Amiodarone and metoprolol
   - Coumadin restarted
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Could be responsible for chest pressure,
   although ischemia and stomach or other organs possible. Chest pressure
   had possibly been coincident with SVT and therefore possible that pain
   was strain and ischemia.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow, somewhat decompensated (though not as severely as
   now) with poor PO intake also. Also rapid ventricular rates may have
   contributed. Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures in 80s at
   clinic).
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary (not presently)
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine normalizing now that cardiogenic shock resolved. Possible
   prerenal component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with
   intravascular depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I but can restart if BP can tolerate
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   - Trend LFTs
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - Switch IV PPI (pantoprazole) to PO (omeprazole)
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, INR elevated - previously on coumadin and
   now thought to have shock liver.
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, lactulose.

     Ms [**Known lastname 14467**] has been very clear on multiple occasions that she feels
   so uncomfortable in recent months she accepts mortality if this happens
   naturally. She wishes to pass away at home rather than in a hospital or
   nursing home and to be comfortable at that time. She has had aversion
   to ""hospice care"" and even rehab in the past though states she wishes
   to be comfortable and is tired of being so uncomfortable. She is aware
   she has severe cardiopulmonary disease. Unfortunately she lives in pain
   as she has been unable to tolerate multiple pain medications.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, mitral regurgitation, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. She presented with hypotension, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, and a sore right heel. She was fluid overloaded and transferred to the CCU for diuresis. Despite initial failure of diuresis on the floor, it was successful with the substitution of dopamine for milrinone. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 95/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure due to mitral regurgitation and a low left ventricular ejection fraction. Her symptoms of hypotension, shortness of breath, and edema suggest ongoing heart failure. Close monitoring and management of her fluid balance, renal function, and cardiac status are necessary.

2. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has been experiencing tachyarrhythmias, which have responded to metoprolol and amiodarone. She is currently on amiodarone and monitoring on telemetry. It is important to continue monitoring her cardiac rhythm and adjust her medication regimen as needed to prevent further arrhythmias"

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of
   30%.Decompensated at present.  Previously no output to milrinone, lasix
   and phenylephrine. Stopped milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and
   phenylephrine and had good UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt is still volume
   overloaded with peripheral edema, but JVP no longer elevated. BP has
   been on the low side, limiting amount of diuresis possible.
   - decrease rate of lasix gtt for gentler diuresis (goal 1-1.5 L
   negative)
   - Continue dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min
   - Continue to hold ACEI
   - Continue amiodarone given arhythmogenicity of dopamine
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   - Probably one more day of diuresis until creatinine bumps or becomes
   significantly hypotensive
   - goal is to optimize patient to get her home with hospice, possibly
   Wednesday
   - Appreciate palliative care recs
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Fatigue/weakness: Pt significantly more fatigued after diuresis, most
   likely secondary to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload.
   - Monitor patient
s respiratory status
   - Continue diuresis for now
   Hematoma: Likely traumatic and exacerbated by anticoagulation
   - Monitor hematoma
   - DC anticoagulation
   A fib: On heparin gtt.
   - Discontinue heparin gtt and warfarin as not consistent with her goals
   of care
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow.  Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures
   in 80s at clinic). Diuresis also heavily contributing.
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary with lasix gtt
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0. Possible prerenal
   component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - repeat stool guiuac
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT Coumadin
   -Pain management with morphine PRN
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, lactulose (hold for loose
   stool).

     Ms [**Known lastname 14467**] has been very clear on multiple occasions that she feels
   so uncomfortable in recent months she accepts mortality if this happens
   naturally. She wishes to pass away at home rather than in a hospital or

   to ""hospice care"" and even rehab in the past though states she wishes
   to be comfortable and is tired of being so uncomfortable. She is aware
   she has severe cardiopulmonary disease. Unfortunately she lives in pain

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for worsening heart failure due to mitral regurgitation and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. She is experiencing symptoms of dyspnea and has a history of multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, subacute renal failure, hepatitis, abdominal pain, obstructive lung disease, allergic rhinitis, anxiety, and heel pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is secondary to mitral regurgitation and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. This condition can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can result in inadequate perfusion to vital organs and potential shock.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels indicating subacute renal failure. This can worsen if there is prerenal azotemia due to dehydration or chronic CHF with intravascular depletion.
4. Hepatitis: Although resolving, the patient's elevated liver function tests suggest a potential liver injury, which needs monitoring.
5. Abdominal Pain: The patient's history of ischemic colitis and abdominal pain requires further evaluation and management to prevent complications such as perforation or sepsis.
6. Respiratory Issues: The patient's obstructive lung disease and recent exacerbation may lead to respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER
   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of
   30%.Decompensated at present.  Previously no output to milrinone, lasix
   and phenylephrine. Stopped milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and
   phenylephrine and had good UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt is still volume
   overloaded with peripheral edema, but JVP no longer elevated. BP has
   been on the low side, limiting amount of diuresis possible.
   - decrease rate of lasix gtt for gentler diuresis (goal 1-1.5 L
   negative)
   - Continue dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min
   - Continue to hold ACEI
   - Continue amiodarone given arhythmogenicity of dopamine
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   - Probably one more day of diuresis until creatinine bumps or becomes
   significantly hypotensive
   - goal is to optimize patient to get her home with hospice, possibly
   Wednesday
   - Appreciate palliative care recs
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Fatigue/weakness: Pt significantly more fatigued after diuresis, most
   likely secondary to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload.
   - Monitor patient
s respiratory status
   - Continue diuresis for now
   A fib: On heparin gtt.
   - Discontinue heparin gtt and warfarin as not consistent with her goals
   of care
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow.  Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures
   in 80s at clinic). Diuresis also heavily contributing.
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary with lasix gtt
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0. Possible prerenal
   component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - repeat stool guiuac
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT Coumadin
   -Pain management with morphine PRN
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, lactulose (hold for loose
   stool).

     Ms [**Known lastname 14467**] has been very clear on multiple occasions that she feels
   so uncomfortable in recent months she accepts mortality if this happens
   naturally. She wishes to pass away at home rather than in a hospital or
   nursing home and to be comfortable at that time. She has had aversion
   to ""hospice care"" and even rehab in the past though states she wishes
   to be comfortable and is tired of being so uncomfortable. She is aware
   she has severe cardiopulmonary disease. Unfortunately she lives in pain
   as she has been unable to tolerate multiple pain medications.

   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary with lasix gtt
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0. Possible prerenal
   component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - repeat stool guiuac
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of multiple medical conditions including heart failure, mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to worsening symptoms of heart failure and acute kidney injury. The patient's current condition includes dyspnea, hypotension, and low urine output. She has been on various medications including diuretics, inotropes, anticoagulants, and antiarrhythmics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of mitral regurgitation and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction puts her at risk for further deterioration in cardiac function, leading to increased fluid overload and respiratory distress.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. This can be exacerbated by factors such as hypotension, dehydration, and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of antiarrhythmic medications, there is a risk of recurrent or new arrhythmias, which can compromise cardiac output and increase the risk of stroke.
4. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
5. Pressure ulcers: Imm"

   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of
   30%.Decompensated at present.  Previously no output to milrinone, lasix
   and phenylephrine. Stopped milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and
   phenylephrine and had good UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt is still volume
   overloaded with peripheral edema, but JVP no longer elevated. BP has
   been on the low side, limiting amount of diuresis possible.
   - decrease rate of lasix gtt for gentler diuresis (goal 1-1.5 L
   negative)
   - Continue dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min
   - Continue to hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic dopamine
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   - goal is to get her to be able to get from bed to chair so she can go
   to home with hospice
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow.  Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures
   in 80s at clinic). Diuresis also heavily contributing.
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary with lasix gtt
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0. Possible prerenal
   component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - repeat stool guiuac
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with symptoms of dyspnea. She has a history of heart failure, mitral regurgitation, and a low ejection fraction of 30%. She is currently experiencing volume overload with peripheral edema but has improved with diuretics. The patient also has a history of tachyarrhythmia, coronary artery disease, shock/hypotension, NSTEMI, subacute renal failure, hepatitis, abdominal pain, obstructive lung disease, anxiety, and heel pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is secondary to mitral regurgitation and a low ejection fraction. It is likely to worsen if diuretic therapy is inadequate or if there is an exacerbation of her underlying heart condition.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the 80s, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction if not corrected.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, suggesting renal impairment. This could be due to prerenal causes such as dehydration or chronic heart failure, or intrinsic renal damage.

4. Hepatitis: The patient has resolving hepatitis with elevated liver function tests. If left untreated, it can progress to acute liver failure.

5. Ischemic Colitis: The patient's abdominal pain and guaiac-positive stools raise the possibility of ischem"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER
   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of
   30%.Decompensated at present.  Previously no output to milrinone, lasix
   and phenylephrine. Stopped milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and
   phenylephrine and had good UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt is still volume
   overloaded with peripheral edema, but JVP no longer elevated. BP has
   been on the low side, limiting amount of diuresis possible.
   - decrease rate of lasix gtt for gentler diuresis (goal 1-1.5 L
   negative)
   - Continue dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min
   - Continue to hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic dopamine
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow.  Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures
   in 80s at clinic). Diuresis also heavily contributing.
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary with lasix gtt
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0. Possible prerenal
   component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - repeat stool guiuac
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT Coumadin
   -Pain management with morphine PRN
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, lactulose (hold for loose
   stool).

     Ms [**Known lastname 14467**] has been very clear on multiple occasions that she feels
   so uncomfortable in recent months she accepts mortality if this happens
   naturally. She wishes to pass away at home rather than in a hospital or
   nursing home and to be comfortable at that time. She has had aversion
   to ""hospice care"" and even rehab in the past though states she wishes
   to be comfortable and is tired of being so uncomfortable. She is aware
   she has severe cardiopulmonary disease. Unfortunately she lives in pain
   as she has been unable to tolerate multiple pain medications.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of multiple medical conditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, tachyarrhythmia, NSTEMI, subacute renal failure, hepatitis, abdominal pain, obstructive lung disease, allergic rhinitis, anxiety, and heel pain. She is currently in the ICU for diuresis due to volume overload. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and wishes to pass away at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is secondary to mitral regurgitation and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. She is volume overloaded, which can lead to further decompensation of her heart failure.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a long history of coronary artery disease, which may contribute to decreased flow during hypotension. This could potentially result in myocardial ischemia or infarction.
3. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has been responding well to metoprolol and amiodarone for her tachyarrhythmia. However, there is still a risk of arrhythmias, especially given the use of dopamine as a pressor.
4. Subacute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are still elevated above baseline, indicating possible prerenal components in the setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular depletion.

   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.
   Previously no output to milrinone, lasix and phenylephrine. Stopped
   milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and phenylephrine and had good
   UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt responded to diuresis well with dopamine and
   lasix gtt. Pt now probably close to euvolemic.
   - Will transition patient to PO regimen today  Torsemide 40mg PO BID
   plus metolazone 2.5mg PO BID 30 minutes prior to torsemide
   - Will wean off lasix gtt then later wean off dopamine gtt
   - Continue to hold ACEI
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   - Probable call out to floor tomorrow
   - goal is to optimize patient to get her most likely to a hospice
   facility, possibly Wednesday or Thursday
   - Appreciate palliative care and SW input
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Fatigue/weakness: Pt significantly more fatigued after diuresis, most
   likely secondary to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload.
   Morphine may also be contributing
   - Monitor patient
s respiratory status
   - Slowing down diuresis
   Hematoma: Likely traumatic and exacerbated by anticoagulation

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including heart failure, mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, hepatitis, anxiety, and obstructive lung disease. She has been admitted to the ICU due to acute exacerbation of heart failure and respiratory distress. The patient's current medications include morphine, furosemide, dopamine, lasix, phenylephrine, metoprolol, amiodarone, ASA, atorvastatin, and omeprazole. The patient's condition has been improving with diuresis and optimization of heart failure medications. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise, including volume overload, worsening heart failure, tachyarrhythmia, hematoma, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, shock, NSTEMI, renal failure, hepatitis, abdominal pain, obstructive lung disease, anxiety, and allergic rhinitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has a history of heart failure and is currently on diuretics. If the diuretic therapy is not adequately managed, it can lead to volume overload and worsening heart failure.
2. Worsening Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is likely to worsen if there is inadequate management of fluid balance and cardiac output.
3. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has been on amiodarone for tachyarrhythmia management."

   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.
   Previously no output to milrinone, lasix and phenylephrine. Stopped
   milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and phenylephrine and had good
   UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt responded to diuresis well with dopamine and
   lasix gtt. Pt now probably close to euvolemic.
   - Will transition patient to PO regimen today  Torsemide 40mg PO BID
   plus metolazone 2.5mg PO BID 30 minutes prior to torsemide
   - Will wean off lasix gtt then later wean off dopamine gtt
   - Continue to hold ACEI
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   - Probable call out to floor tomorrow
   - goal is to optimize patient to get her most likely to a hospice
   facility, possibly Wednesday or Thursday
   - Appreciate palliative care and SW input
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Fatigue/weakness: Pt significantly more fatigued after diuresis, most
   likely secondary to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload.
   Morphine may also be contributing
   - Monitor patient
s respiratory status
   - Slowing down diuresis
   Hematoma: Likely traumatic and exacerbated by anticoagulation
   - Monitor hematoma
   - DC anticoagulation
   A fib: On heparin gtt.
   - Discontinue heparin gtt and warfarin as not consistent with her goals
   of care
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow.  Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures
   in 80s at clinic). Diuresis also heavily contributing.
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary with lasix gtt
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0 at 2.0 currently.
   Probably cardiorenal in etiology.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT Coumadin
   -Pain management with morphine PRN, consider increasing dosage
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl (hold for loose
   stool).

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of multiple medical conditions, including heart failure, mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and hepatitis. She was admitted to the ICU due to symptoms of worsened forward flow and volume overload. The patient has been managed with diuretics, pressors, and other medications to improve her condition. Her current goals of care include pain management, optimizing heart function, and transitioning to hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of heart failure and is currently being managed for diastolic heart failure with volume overload. Complications may include worsening heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention.
2. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient's mitral regurgitation may worsen over time, leading to further heart failure symptoms and potential complications.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a long-standing history of coronary artery disease, which can lead to myocardial ischemia and infarction if not adequately managed.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of stroke and other cardiac complications if not properly managed with anticoagulation therapy.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has subacute renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
6. Hepatitis: Although the patient's hepatitis"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER
   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.
   Decompensated at present.  Previously no output to milrinone, lasix and
   phenylephrine. Stopped milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and
   phenylephrine and had good UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt responded to
   diuresis well with dopamine and lasix gtt.
   - Will probably discontinue diuresis today
   - decrease rate of lasix gtt for gentler diuresis (goal 1-1.5 L
   negative)
   - Continue dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min
   - Continue to hold ACEI
   - Continue amiodarone given arhythmogenicity of dopamine
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   - goal is to optimize patient to get her home with hospice, possibly
   Wednesday
   - Appreciate palliative care recs
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Fatigue/weakness: Pt significantly more fatigued after diuresis, most
   likely secondary to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload.
   - Monitor patient
s respiratory status
   - Continue diuresis for now
   Hematoma: Likely traumatic and exacerbated by anticoagulation
   - Monitor hematoma
   - DC anticoagulation
   A fib: On heparin gtt.
   - Discontinue heparin gtt and warfarin as not consistent with her goals
   of care
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow.  Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures
   in 80s at clinic). Diuresis also heavily contributing.
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary with lasix gtt
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0 at 2.0 currently.
   Probably cardiorenal in etiology.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - repeat stool guiuac
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT Coumadin
   -Pain management with morphine PRN
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl (hold for loose
   stool).

     Ms [**Known lastname 14467**] has been very clear on multiple occasions that she feels
   so uncomfortable in recent months she accepts mortality if this happens
   naturally. She wishes to pass away at home rather than in a hospital or
   nursing home and to be comfortable at that time. She has had aversion
   to ""hospice care"" and even rehab in the past though states she wishes
   to be comfortable and is tired of being so uncomfortable. She is aware
   she has severe cardiopulmonary disease. Unfortunately she lives in pain
   as she has been unable to tolerate multiple pain medications.

 FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER
   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.
   Previously no output to milrinone, lasix and phenylephrine. Stopped
   milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and phenylephrine and had good
   UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt responded to diuresis well with dopamine and
   lasix gtt. Pt now probably still somewhat hypervolemic.
   - Continue torsemide 40mg PO BID plus metolazone 2.5mg PO Daily 30
   minutes prior to torsemide
   - Consider restarting ACEi
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   - Call out to floor today
   - goal is to optimize patient to get her most likely to a hospice
   facility, possibly Thursday or Friday although pt wanting to go home
   - Appreciate palliative care and SW input
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Fatigue/weakness: Pt significantly more fatigued after diuresis, most
   likely secondary to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload.
   Morphine may also be contributing
   - Monitor patient
s respiratory status
   - Slowing down diuresis
   Hematoma: Likely traumatic and exacerbated by anticoagulation
   - Monitor hematoma
   - DC anticoagulation
   A fib: On heparin gtt.
   - Discontinue heparin gtt and warfarin as not consistent with her goals
   of care
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0 at 1.9 currently but
   stable. Probably cardiorenal in etiology.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT none, not consistent with goals of care
   -Pain management with morphine PRN, consider increasing dosage
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl (hold for loose
   stool).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain. She has a history of mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including heart failure, tachy-arrhythmia, fatigue/weakness, hematoma, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, NSTEMI, subacute renal failure, hepatitis, abdominal pain, obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis, anxiety, and heel pain.

The patient has responded well to diuresis and is currently on an oral diuretic regimen. Her heart failure is being managed with medications such as torsemide, metolazone, dopamine, and phenylephrine. The patient's tachy-arrhythmia is being treated with amiodarone. Her fatigue/weakness is believed to be secondary to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload. The hematoma is likely traumatic and exacerbated by anticoagulation. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on heparin gtt.

The patient's coronary artery disease and NSTEMI are being managed with aspirin. Her subacute renal failure is likely cardiorenal in etiology. The patient's hepatitis is resolving, and her abdominal pain is believed to be ischemic. Her obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis is being treated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including heart failure, mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease, NSTEMI, subacute renal failure, hepatitis, abdominal pain, obstructive lung disease, anxiety, and heel pain. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, NSAIDs, Percocet, verapamil, neurontin, tramadol, primidone, fexofenadine, codeine, darvon, and propoxyphene. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing symptoms of dyspnea.

Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure secondary to mitral regurgitation. She is volume overloaded and requires diuresis to achieve euvolemia, which will improve forward flow and end-organ perfusion. The goal is to optimize her condition for possible transfer to a hospice facility.
2. Tachy-Arrhythmia: The patient has responded to metoprolol and is currently on amiodarone. Telemetry monitoring is recommended, and she should maintain potassium and magnesium levels above 4 and 2 respectively.
3. Fatigue/Weakness: The patient is experiencing increased fatigue after diuresis, likely due to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload. Morphine may also be contributing to her fatigue. Respiratory status should be closely monitored, and diuresis should be slowed"

   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.
   Previously no output to milrinone, lasix and phenylephrine. Stopped
   milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and phenylephrine and had good
   UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt responded to diuresis well with dopamine and
   lasix gtt. Pt now probably still somewhat hypervolemic.
   - Continue torsemide 40mg PO BID plus metolazone 2.5mg PO Daily 30
   minutes prior to torsemide
   - Consider restarting ACEi
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   - Call out to floor today
   - goal is to optimize patient to get her most likely to a hospice
   facility, possibly Thursday or Friday although pt wanting to go home
   - Appreciate palliative care and SW input
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Fatigue/weakness: Pt significantly more fatigued after diuresis, most
   likely secondary to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload.
   Morphine may also be contributing
   - Monitor patient
s respiratory status
   - Slowing down diuresis
   Hematoma: Likely traumatic and exacerbated by anticoagulation
   - Monitor hematoma
   - DC anticoagulation
   A fib: On heparin gtt.
   - Discontinue heparin gtt and warfarin as not consistent with her goals
   of care
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0 at 1.9 currently but
   stable. Probably cardiorenal in etiology.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT none, not consistent with goals of care
   -Pain management with morphine PRN, consider increasing dosage
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl (hold for loose
   stool).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of worsened forward flow in the context of volume overload. She has a history of mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. The patient's heart failure is likely secondary to mitral regurgitation, and diuresis is key to improve her condition.

Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is due to mitral regurgitation and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. The goal is to optimize the patient's condition by continuing diuretics, considering restarting ACE inhibitors, strict intake/output monitoring, and a low-sodium diet.

2. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient responded well to metoprolol and amiodarone for her tachyarrhythmia. Telemetry monitoring should be continued, and amiodarone should be maintained as a life-long medication.

3. Fatigue/weakness: The patient is experiencing increased fatigue after diuresis, likely due to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload. Morphine may also be contributing to her fatigue. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and slowing down diuresis may help improve her symptoms.

4. Hematoma: The patient has a hematoma that is likely traumatic and exacerbated by anticoagulation. Monitoring the hematoma and discontinuing anticoagulation are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER
   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2086**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.
   Previously no output to milrinone, lasix and phenylephrine. Stopped
   milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and phenylephrine and had good
   UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt responded to diuresis well with dopamine and
   lasix gtt. Pt now probably close to euvolemic.
   - Will transition patient to PO regimen today  Torsemide 40mg PO BID
   plus metolazone 2.5mg PO Daily 30 minutes prior to torsemide
   - Continue to hold ACEI
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   - Probable call out to floor today
   - goal is to optimize patient to get her most likely to a hospice
   facility, possibly Thursday or Friday although pt wanting to go home
   - Appreciate palliative care and SW input
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**2-13**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Fatigue/weakness: Pt significantly more fatigued after diuresis, most
   likely secondary to reduced stroke volume after reduced preload.
   Morphine may also be contributing
   - Monitor patient
s respiratory status
   - Slowing down diuresis
   Hematoma: Likely traumatic and exacerbated by anticoagulation
   - Monitor hematoma
   - DC anticoagulation
   A fib: On heparin gtt.
   - Discontinue heparin gtt and warfarin as not consistent with her goals
   of care
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0 at 1.9 currently but
   stable. Probably cardiorenal in etiology.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT none, not consistent with goals of care
   -Pain management with morphine PRN, consider increasing dosage
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl (hold for loose
   stool).
