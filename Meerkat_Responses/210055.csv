   Assessment and Plan
   69F with DM2, HTN, recent diverticulitis and nephrolithiasis presents
   with fevers, rigors and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral
   stent placement.
   # Fever: High fever with rigors concerning for bacterial
   infection/bacteremia.  Given recent GU manipulation most likely source
   is urine, especially given positive UA.  CXR clear, no localizing
   pulmonary symptoms suggestive of pneumonia.  PE unlikely given acuity,
   degree of fever and lack of hypoxia.  Pt has history of recent
   antibiotic tx raising concern for c. diff although leukocytosis lower
   than previously and no diarrhea.  Also had treatment for diverticulitis
   2 months ago with associated microperforation, although non-tender on
   abd exam with no recent abd pain or change in stool.  Did have
   relatively recent knee tap, but without evidence for prior or ongoing
   infection in the joint.
   -blood cultures
   -urine cultures
   -Empiric antibiotics with vanc (given recent procedure), cipro/ctx for
   double GNR coverage for potential GU source
   -Tylenol PRN fevers
   -c. diff toxin
   -r/o flu
   -Low threshold for CT abd to eval for abscess if continues to spike.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach.  Pt most likely dry based on subjective
   thirst, procedurization, febrility and prolonged NPO status prior to
   procedure.
   -PO and IV hydration overnight
   -Check TSH
   -1gram tylenol prn fever
   -tx likely infection as above.
   # ARF: Creatinine has ranged 1.0-2.0 in past 3 months, baseline likely
   1-1.3.  Had ARF in setting of diverticulitis which fully resolved, had
   cr of 2.0 as outpatient for unclear reasons, was 1.6 prior to procedure
   and 1.9 currently.  Urine lytes with FeNa 2%, in setting of pt being on
   HCTZ yesterday and after hydration, so is less informative. Elevation
   likely pre-renal despite this.
   -Hold lisinopril and HCTZ acutely
   -Agressive IVF/PO hydration
   -Tx infection as above
   -consider repeat GU imaging if persists to ensure no new obstruction in
   setting of instrumentation, although unlikely given stent in place.
   # Nephrolithiasis: s/p lithotripsy/ureteral stent replacement
   -f/u urology recs
   -foley in place
   # HTN:
   -continue atenolol, hold HCTZ/ACEI as above

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis. She presents with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after undergoing lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement.

Assessment:
1. Fever: High fever with rigors concerning for bacterial infection/bacteremia. Most likely source is urine, especially given positive urine analysis. Chest X-ray is clear, no localizing pulmonary symptoms suggestive of pneumonia. Physical examination does not show signs of elevated jugular venous pressure or neck stiffness, indicating no evidence of sepsis or meningitis.
2. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia. The patient is likely dehydrated based on subjective thirst, proceduralization, febrility, and prolonged NPO status prior to the procedure.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): Creatinine has ranged from 1.0-2.0 in the past three months, with a baseline likely between 1-1.3. The patient had ARF during diverticulitis, which resolved, and also had an elevated creatinine of 2.0 as an outpatient for unclear reasons. The current creatinine level is 1.9. Urine electrolytes with a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 2% indicate pre-renal azotemia, especially considering the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of nephrolithiasis who underwent ureteral stent replacement and lithotripsy. She is now in the ICU due to postoperative fever and sepsis, characterized by tachycardia, elevated white blood cell count, and possible urinary source. The abdominal exam is reassuring, indicating no significant diverticulitis or intraperitoneal process. The most likely source of sepsis is urinary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is already being treated with antibiotics (Vanco, Flagyl, CTX, Cipro) to cover for various possible pathogens, including C. Diff. The abdominal exam will be monitored as oral intake progresses, and a CT abdomen will be performed to rule out abscess formation. The patient's tachycardia will be closely monitored, and further investigations will be pursued if necessary.

2) Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is being supported with intravenous fluids and careful monitoring of urine output and electrolytes. The likely cause of renal failure is pre-renal insufficiency due to decreased renal perfusion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) will be held, and the foley catheter will remain in place to monitor urine output.

ICU care will include nutrition through oral intake, glycemic control, and appropriate line management. Prophylactic measures"

   Assessment and Plan
   69F with DM2, HTN, recent diverticulitis and nephrolithiasis presents
   with fevers, rigors and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral
   stent placement.
   # Fever: High fever with rigors concerning for bacterial
   infection/bacteremia.  Given recent GU manipulation most likely source
   is urine, especially given positive UA.  Pt has history of recent
   antibiotic tx raising concern for c. diff and now with elevated WBC
   count there is a high concern for C. diff even without diarrhea.  Also
   had treatment for diverticulitis 2 months ago with associated
   microperforation, although non-tender on abd exam with no recent abd
   pain or change in stool.  Did have relatively recent knee tap, but
   without evidence for prior or ongoing infection in the joint.
   -F/u Blood and urine Cx.
   -Empiric antibiotics with vanc (given recent procedure), cipro/ctx for
   double GNR coverage for potential GU source and now flagyl for c. diff
   coverage.
   -Tylenol PRN fevers
   -c. diff toxin
   -r/o flu
   -t/c CT ab to look for evidence of colitis or diverticulitis.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach.  Pt most likely dry based on subjective
   thirst, procedurization, febrility and prolonged NPO status prior to
   procedure.
   -PO and IV hydration overnight
   -Check TSH
   -1gram tylenol prn fever
   -tx likely infection as above.
   # ARF: Creatinine has ranged 1.0-2.0 in past 3 months, baseline likely
   1-1.3.  Currently she has decreasing cr post procedure that is
   resolving with fluids giving some creedednce to a pre-renal etiology
   for ARF.
   -Hold lisinopril and HCTZ acutely
   -Agressive IVF/PO hydration
   -Tx infection as above
   -consider repeat GU imaging if persists to ensure no new obstruction in
   setting of instrumentation, although unlikely given stent in place.
   # Hypokalemia: In the setting of fluids.  Patient likely diuresed some
   potassium.  Will replete orally as needed.
   -Check set of pm lytes.
   # Nephrolithiasis: s/p lithotripsy/ureteral stent replacement
   -f/u urology recs

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis. She presents with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after undergoing lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement. The patient's recent abdominal pain, elevated white blood cell count, and positive urine analysis raise concerns for a urinary tract infection, possibly bacteremia. Additionally, there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection due to recent antibiotic treatment and elevated creatinine levels indicating acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.3°C (102.8°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/66 mmHg to 145/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is alert and awake, with minimal rhales in the lower lobes of the right lung, tachycardia, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs or gallops appreciated. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with positive bowel sounds.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 29.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, and hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L. Other lab"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis. She presented with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after undergoing lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement. Her initial workup showed possible GNR bacteremia and candidemia, most likely from a urinary source given recent manipulation. She has remained afebrile overnight with improvement in her white blood cell count and subjective improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has been febrile and has shown signs of infection with possible GNR bacteremia and candidemia. There is a risk of worsening infection if appropriate antibiotics are not administered or if the source of infection is not adequately treated.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have ranged from 1.0-2.0 in the past three months, indicating a potential baseline kidney function. The current creatinine levels are decreasing post-procedure, suggesting resolution of acute kidney injury. However, continued monitoring and management of fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function are necessary to prevent further complications.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient had mild fluid overload as indicated by chest X-ray. It is important to monitor and adjust intravenous fluid administration carefully to avoid fluid overload and related complications such as pulmonary edema.

   69  yo female admitted with nephrolithiasis and now s/p ureteral stent
   placement and lithotripsy but with concerning evolution of significant
   bacteremia and fungemia with likely urinary source for both.  We have
   maintained reasonable vigilance in terms of evaluation of further
   possible sources with abdominal CT which did not show focal collection
   of GI source of polymicrobial infection.
   1)Sepsis-Reasonable response to fluids to date, no pressors required
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl to continue
   -IVF bolus as needed
   -Consider D/C of flagyl with C. Diff negative
   -Will pursue micafungin in the setting of yeast seen in blood
   -Will follow up sensitivities
   2)Acidosis-She has a component of Anion Gap and Non-Anion Gap acidisos-
   -This may be related in large part to renal failure, diarrhea and NS
   given which all may contribute
   -Will check Lactate and ketones to confirm the above.
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Renal dose meds
   -continue with adequate IVf support
   4)Neprholithiasis-
   -Stent in place

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female admitted to the ICU with nephrolithiasis. She has undergone ureteral stent placement and lithotripsy. However, she is experiencing significant bacteremia and fungemia with a likely urinary source for both infections. The abdominal CT did not show any focal collection of a gastrointestinal source of polymicrobial infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. It is important to monitor her response to the antibiotics and consider discontinuing flagyl if Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) is negative. Micafungin may be pursued in the setting of yeast seen in the blood, and sensitivities will be followed up.

2. Acidosis: The patient has both anion gap and non-anion gap acidosis. This may be related to renal failure, diarrhea, and normal saline (NS) given, which may contribute to the acidosis. Checking lactate and ketones will confirm the above.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure. Renal dose medications should be continued, and adequate IV fluid support should be maintained.

4. Nephrolithiasis: The stent is currently in place, but the patient has fungemia. A central line is not recommended at this time"
