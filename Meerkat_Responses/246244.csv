 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
   61 yo Mwith HTN and COPD initially presented to the ED c/o SOB and
   noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in ARF with
   hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, with transaminitis and synthetic
   dysfunction..
   1. Altered mental status:  In light of his nodular liver on Abd CT,
   pt
s altered mental status is now felt to be most likely secondary to
   hepatic encephalopathy from decompensated cirrohosis (likely
   alcoholic).  His ability/willingness to accept po lactulose is
   limited.  Given lack of improvement in mental status with improved
   sodium, hyponatremia likely not contributing to AMS. CT head poor study
   study, but no gross abnormalities identified.
   - continue lactulose, add rifamixin
   2. Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic hyponatremiain setting of cirrhosis.
   Possible type II hepatorenal.  Improved s/p tolvaptan, but had also
   gotten significant amount ot albumin. Renal following.

   3. Acute renal failure:
   --Monitor renal fxn
   --avoiding IVF given hyponatremia in setting of fluid overload
   --renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins, no IV contrast
   4. Hyperkalemia: No EKG chges. Likely secondary to ARF.
   --Improved s/p kayexalate

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be massively fluid overloaded, experiencing acute renal failure, hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's altered mental status is believed to be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy from decompensated cirrhosis, likely alcoholic in origin. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including hyponatremia, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, hyperkalemia, coagulopathy, and shortness of breath. He also has a possible history of alcohol use disorder and potential human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, adding rifamixin, managing hyponatremia with tolvaptan and albumin, avoiding intravenous fluids due to fluid overload, monitoring renal function, treating hyperkalemia with kayexalate, addressing liver dysfunction with midodrine, octreotide, lactulose, and rifamixin, and supplementing with vitamin K for coagulopathy. The patient's shortness of breath is being managed with albuterol nebs, and he is being monitored for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
   61 yo Mwith HTN and COPD initially presented to the ED c/o SOB and
   noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in ARF with
   hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, with transaminitis and synthetic
   dysfunction. At baseline, he is A&Ox3 but now only oriented to self.
   1. Altered mental status: In the setting of both hyponatremia and
   hepatic (acute?) impairment, the etiology is not entirely clear.  Onset
   seems to be somewhat acute as it seems that the pt was initially able
   to provide a hx in the ED.  He is fully independent at baseline and was
   seen by his PCP within the last month. Neuro exam is non-focal,
   clinical picture seems most c/w acute encephalopathy. ETOH level zero
   several hours after admission and pt denies recent binging, but he does
   have anextensive ETOH hx; exam currently does not suggest withdrawal as
   etiology of AMS. No meningismus on exam and no headache/photophobia.
   --For now, will treat hyponatremia, and attempt to elucidate origins of
   ARF and hepatic failure as they may be source of encephalopathy
   --assess for CNS causes with CT head and possibly LP; low suspicion for
   bacterail meningitis given afebrile, relatively low WBC, nothing on
   exam to suggest, but viral is a possibility.
   --lactulose titrated to 4 BMs per day for the possiblity that hepatic
   encepholopathy may be contributing
   2. Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic hyponatremia vs SIADH. Given low albumin,
   and [**Last Name (un) 2871**] body anasarca, this seems most likely secondary to third
   spacing from hepatic dysfuntion. Urine sodium of 10 despite lasix
   suggests that kidneys are functioning in an extremely sodium avid
   manner.  No evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria currently.  Will
   assess for CNS cause with head CT.  Renal following.
   --Initial attempt at mgt with tolvaptan, q4h chem7 and serial urine
   sodium/osms per renal recs
   --if ineffective, will consider switch to hypertonic saline
   --d/w renal re: salt tabs in setting of tolvaptan; no fluid restriction
   while on tolvatptan
   --f/u renal recs
   --search for causes of SIADH with CT chest/ abd/pelvis
   3. Acute renal failure:  As above, kidneys are functioning in a sodium
   avid manner. Renal team working on urine sediment. Proteinurria is not
   in nephrotic range. CK initially 700 and trending down, likely not
   enough to account for [**Last Name (un) **] although rhabdo may have occured several days
   PTA.
   --Monitor renal fxn
   --Not restricting fluids in setting of tolvaptan, but no IVF given
   hyponatremia, fluid overload, and possibility of SIADH
   --renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins, no IV contrast
   4. Hyperkalemia: No EKG chges. Likely secondary to ARF.
   --Improved s/p kayexalate
   --monitor with lytes initially q4h
   --repeat kayexalate if k>5.5
   5. Transminitis/ elevated bili/ synthetic dysfunction: Prior extensive
   hx of ETOH abuse with multiple admissions leading up to [**2119**].  Pt
   denies ETOH x 2 month. His neighbor states 2 years.  AST:ALT ratio on
   admision suggestive of alcoholic liver injury, but AST may be coming
   from other source given CK=700.  INR of 1.6  trending up suggests that
   this process is at least a few days old.  Albumin 2.6. The degree of
   synthetic dysfunction exceeds what I would expect with this limited
   degree of transminitis, but pt may have undiagnosed cirrhosis. As
   above, hepatic process may be contributing to encephalopathy (+
   asterixis).
   -- CT abdomen as pt too obese for adequate US
   --trend LFTS
   --consider hepatology consult
   -- empiric lactulose given AMS
   --hepatitis serologies
   6.  Coagulopathy: Attributing this to hepatic dysfunction
   -- Vitamin K 2mg po, trend
   7. Shortness of Breath: Rapidly improved with albuterol nebs on arrival
   to MICU and subsequently sating in high 90s on room air.  Given his
   reported hx of emphysema, seems like a mild COPD exacerbation that was
   untreated in the ED and floor given presumptive CHF diagnosis.  At this
   point, pt seems to be breathing comfortably on room air.  As metal
   status improved slightly off oxygen, some concern that the may have a
   propensity to retain. As such, would aim for sats in low 90s if supp O2
   needed.
   8. ETOH hx: Despite hx given by pt and neighbor, MCV of 99 and AST:ALT
   pattern suggest continued ETOH.  Not writing for CIWA currently as not
   actively withdrawing and AMS etiology unclear
   --thiamine, folate supplementation; check b12
   9. Possible hx of HIV+: d/w PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 141**] currently not consentable.

The patient is a 61-year-old male with hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be massively fluid overloaded. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY): The patient has hyponatremia, which is low sodium levels in the blood. This condition is associated with both hyponatremia and hepatic impairment. The etiology is unclear, but the onset seems to be somewhat acute. The patient's mental status has altered from being fully independent to only being oriented to himself. There is no evidence of withdrawal or meningismus on examination. The patient will be treated for hyponatremia and attempts will be made to elucidate the origins of acute renal failure and hepatic failure as they may be the source of encephalopathy. A head CT scan and possibly a lumbar puncture will be assessed for CNS causes. Lactulose will be titrated to 4 bowel movements per day for the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy.

2. RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): The kidneys are functioning in a sodium avid manner. Renal function will be monitored, and urine sediment analysis will be conducted. Proteinuria is not in the nephrotic range"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of AMS (altered mental status). The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is experiencing symptoms consistent with SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), including ascites and pleural effusions. The patient is also showing signs of renal failure and liver function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and AMS, there is a high risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to cognitive dysfunction and altered levels of consciousness.
2. Infection: The presence of ascites and pleural effusions increases the risk of infection, particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which can progress to sepsis if left untreated.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which can worsen without appropriate management and may require dialysis.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function test results suggest ongoing liver dysfunction, which can lead to further decompensation and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Respiratory Distress: The patient's low oxygen saturation and respiratory rate indicate potential respiratory distress, which may be due to pulmonary edema or another underlying cause.
6. Bleeding Risk: The patient's prolonged PT/INR suggests an increased risk of bleeding, especially if invasive procedures or interventions are required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath. He was found to be massively fluid overloaded, experiencing acute kidney failure with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, as well as transaminitis and synthetic dysfunction. The patient's mental status has progressively worsened, and he is now somnolent. Imaging revealed a nodular liver, consistent with acute hepatic decompensation resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output acute renal failure, and possible hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

Potential medical complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's waxing and waning mental status may be attributed to severe hyponatremia, hepatic derangement, and hepatic encephalopathy. Immediate treatment is necessary to address this issue.
2. Hyponatremia: Correction of the patient's hyponatremia should be done gradually to avoid rapid changes in serum osmolarity. Tolvaptan therapy may be considered for renal management.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely secondary to liver failure, possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome. Close monitoring of renal function is essential, and treatment with midodrine and octreotide may be initiated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient was found to be massively fluid overloaded, experiencing acute renal failure with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, as well as transaminitis and synthetic dysfunction. Imaging revealed a nodular liver, suggesting acute hepatic decompensation resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output acute renal failure (ARF), and possible hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's waxing and waning mental status could be attributed to hyponatremia, hepatorenal derangement, and hepatic encephalopathy. Close monitoring is necessary, and lactulose should be administered to manage hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's low serum sodium levels indicate hypervolemic hyponatremia due to hepatic dysfunction. Tolvaptan can be used to correct the hyponatremia, but caution must be exercised to avoid rapid correction, which could lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely secondary to liver failure, possibly hepatorenal syndrome. Renal function should be closely monitored, and treatment with"

   61 yo male with h/o HTN and COPD presented to the ED with SOB and was
   noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in ARF with
   hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and transaminitis / synthetic dysfunction.
   At baseline, he is A&Ox3 but now with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.
   Given nodular liver on CT, this is all consistent with acute hepatic
   decompensation resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output ARF
   and possible HRS.
   # Altered mental status: Likely [**3-6**] hyponatermia, hepatorenal
   derangement, and hepatic encephalopathy.  No evidence of ETOH
   withdrawal.  Refusing lactulose.
   - Gradual correction of hyponatremia
   - Evaluation of Hepatic and renal failure as below

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be massively fluid overloaded, in acute renal failure with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, and transaminitis/synthetic dysfunction. The patient's mental status has waxed and waned, and he is currently alert and oriented to time, place, and person but has fluctuating mental status. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered mental status: Likely due to hyponatremia, hepatorenal derangement, and hepatic encephalopathy. No evidence of ethanol withdrawal. Refusing lactulose.
   - Gradual correction of hyponatremia
   - Evaluation of hepatic and renal failure
   
2. Hyponatremia: Appears to be hypervolemic hyponatremia from hepatic dysfunction. Urine sodium of 10 despite lasix. No evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria.
   - Tolvaptan per renal
   - Close monitoring of serum electrolytes and serum osm to avoid too rapid correction of hyponatremia
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   
3. Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology despite comprehensive work-up. Kidneys are sodium avid.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath. Upon arrival, he was found to be massively fluid overloaded, with acute renal failure, hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's altered mental status is believed to be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy from decompensated cirrhosis, likely alcoholic in origin. He is currently receiving lactulose for this condition.

The patient's hyponatremia is thought to be hypervolemic in the setting of cirrhosis, and there is a possibility of type II hepatorenal syndrome. Tolvaptan has improved his sodium levels, but the effect may be due to albumin administration as well. Renal function will be closely monitored.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, which is being managed by avoiding intravenous fluids, using renal dosing of medications, and avoiding nephrotoxins. Hyperkalemia is likely secondary to acute renal failure and has improved with kayexalate treatment. Electrolyte levels will continue to be monitored.

The patient's transaminase levels, elevated bilirubin, and synthetic dysfunction indicate acutely decompensated cirrhosis. Further evaluation for hepatitis serologies and consultation with hepatology are recommended. Coagulopathy is attributed to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's condition has shown improvement in several areas. His altered mental status, or hepatic encephalopathy, has significantly improved with current therapy. He will continue receiving lactulose and rifamixin.

His hyponatremia has also improved, but there is a concern for type II hepatorenal syndrome. The patient received tolvaptan, which helped improve his condition, along with a significant amount of albumin. Renal function is being closely monitored.

The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome. The plan is to anticipate improvement with albumin administration, considering dosing concurrently with lasix since the patient is sodium avid with a low sodium level. Midodrine and octreotide will continue to be administered, and renal function will be closely monitored. Fluid overload should be avoided, and medications will be dosed based on renal function to prevent nephrotoxicity.

The patient's hyperkalemia has improved with kayexalate treatment, and repeat dosing will be considered if potassium levels remain elevated.

The patient has elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and synthetic dysfunction,"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with h/o HTN and COPD presented to the ED with SOB and was
   noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in ARF with
   hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and transaminitis / synthetic dysfunction.
   At baseline, he is A&Ox3 but now with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.
   Given nodular liver on CT, this is all consistent with acute hepatic
   decompensation resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output ARF
   and possible HRS. New developments include coffee ground emesis
   # Altered mental status: Likely [**3-6**] hyponatermia, hepatorenal
   derangement, and hepatic encephalopathy.  No evidence of ETOH
   withdrawal.  Improved with lactulose.
   - Gradual correction of hyponatremia
   - Evaluation of Hepatic and renal failure as below
   - TID lactulose
   # Hyponatremia: Looks like hypervolemic hyponatremia from hepatic
   dysfuntion. Urine sodium of 10 despite lasix.  No evidence of nephrotic
   range proteinuria.  S/p tolvaptan.
   - Continue salt tablets and fluid restrict
   - Close monitoring of serum electrolytes and serum osm to avoid too
   rapid correction of hyponatremia
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   # Acute renal failure:  Likely secondary to liver failure, likely
   hepatorenal syndrome, type II.
   - Renal following
   - On midodrine and octreotide
   - Albumin and Lasix today
   # Cirrhosis:  H/o ETOH abuse, and has admitted to drinking recently
   - Appreciate hepatology consult
   - Continue Thiamine / Folate
   #HTN: Received nifedipine overnight.  Possibly related to ETOH
   withdrawal, but will avoid SIWA given mental status.
   - Continue nifedipine.
   # Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed: Likely [**3-6**] hepatic dysfunction and
   coagulopathy.  Three episode of coffee ground emesis and hct drop.
   - NPO for EGD / [**Last Name (un) **]
   - On PPI.
   # COPD with SOB/wheezing: Continue albuterol.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and COPD.
- He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be massively fluid overloaded.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to liver failure, and may have hepatorenal syndrome type II.
- He also has hypervolemic hyponatremia and low output ARF.
- The patient's mental status is altered, and he shows signs of hepatic encephalopathy.
- He has a nodular liver on CT, indicating acute hepatic decompensation.
- The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and has admitted to drinking recently.
- He has an Hct drop from 31 to 26 and has been given a blood transfusion.
- The patient has been started on lactulose, nifedipine, midodrine, octreotide, and other medications.
- He is currently in the ICU and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and waxing/waning mental status suggest hepatic encephalopathy. This condition occurs when toxins build up in the bloodstream due to severe liver dysfunction and can cause confusion, sleep disturbances, and other cognitive impairments.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's renal failure is likely secondary to liver failure, which can lead to hepatorenal syndrome."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be massively fluid overloaded, in acute renal failure (ARF) with hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and transaminitis/synthetic dysfunction. The patient has also shown signs of acute hepatic decompensation, hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output ARF, and possible hepatic vein thrombosis (HRS).

The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with episodes of altered mental status, likely due to hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and possible alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been improving with lactulose administration.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Altered mental status: Gradual correction of hyponatremia, evaluation of hepatic and renal failure, and treatment with rifaximin and lactulose.
2. Hyponatremia: Continue salt tablets and fluid restriction, close monitoring of serum electrolytes and serum osmolarity to avoid rapid correction of hyponatremia, and obtain a 24-hour urine sample for evaluation.
3. Acute renal failure: Likely secondary to liver failure, possibly hepatorenal syndrome type II. Renal follow-up, continue midodrine and octreotide,"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with h/o HTN and COPD presented to the ED with SOB and was
   noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in ARF with
   hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and transaminitis / synthetic dysfunction.
   At baseline, he is A&Ox3 but now with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.
   Given nodular liver on CT, this is all consistent with acute hepatic
   decompensation resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output ARF
   and possible HRS. New developments include coffee ground emesis
   # Altered mental status: Likely [**3-6**] hyponatermia, hepatorenal
   derangement, and hepatic encephalopathy.  No evidence of ETOH
   withdrawal.  Improved with lactulose.
   - Gradual correction of hyponatremia
   - Evaluation of Hepatic and renal failure as below
   - Rifaximin, TID lactulose
   # Hyponatremia: Looks like hypervolemic hyponatremia from hepatic
   dysfuntion. Urine sodium of 10 despite lasix.  S/p tolvaptan.
   - Continue salt tablets and fluid restrict
   - Close monitoring of serum electrolytes and serum osm to avoid too
   rapid correction of hyponatremia
   - spot urine checks not s/o nephrotic range proteinuria, but will
   obtain 24 hour urine for evaluation
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   # Acute renal failure:  Likely secondary to liver failure, likely
   hepatorenal syndrome, type II.
   - Renal following
   - On midodrine and octreotide
   - Albumin and Lasix today
   # Cirrhosis:  H/o ETOH abuse, and has admitted to drinking recently
   - Appreciate hepatology consult
   - Continue Thiamine / Folate
   #HTN: Received nifedipine overnight.  Possibly related to ETOH
   withdrawal, but will avoid SIWA given mental status.
   - Continue nifedipine.
   # Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed: Likely [**3-6**] hepatic dysfunction and
   coagulopathy.  Three episode of coffee ground emesis and hct drop-
   appears to have stopped for the time being
   - NPO for EGD / [**Last Name (un) **] (will clarify timing with hepatology)
   - On PPI.
   # COPD with SOB/wheezing: Continue albuterol.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be massively fluid overloaded, experiencing acute renal failure (ARF) with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, as well as transaminitis and synthetic dysfunction. 

The patient has a nodular liver on CT scan, which suggests acute hepatic decompensation resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output ARF, and possible hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). He is currently experiencing altered mental status, likely due to hyponatremia, hepatic derangement, and hepatic encephalopathy. There are no signs of ethanol withdrawal. The patient's mental status improved with lactulose administration.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Altered mental status: Gradual correction of hyponatremia, evaluation of hepatic and renal failure, and continued use of lactulose.
2. Hyponatremia: Close monitoring of serum electrolytes and serum osmolarity to avoid rapid correction, spot urine checks, and obtaining a 24-hour urine for evaluation.
3. Acute renal failure: Renal follow-up, midodrine and octreotide therapy, albumin and Lasix administration.
4. Cirrhosis: Appreciate hepatology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's condition has been improving on current therapy, but he continues to have several medical complications that require attention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is on supplemental oxygen and has a low SpO2 level. It is important to monitor his respiratory status closely and continue with appropriate respiratory support as needed.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed, Other (GI Bleed, GIB): The patient has been experiencing bloody sputum and coffee ground emesis. He received two units of packed red blood cells and is currently being monitored for further bleeding. Further evaluation with an endoscopy is planned.

3. Hyponatremia (Low Sodium, Hyposmolality): The patient has hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting of cirrhosis, which may be related to hepatorenal syndrome. Treatment with tolvaptan and albumin has been initiated, and sodium levels will be closely monitored.

4. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient is oliguric and likely has hepatorenal syndrome. Renal function will be monitored, and appropriate"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU with acute decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. 

The patient presented with shortness of breath and was found to have fluid overload in the setting of cirrhosis and renal failure. He was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) with a good response and underwent dialysis with ultrafiltration. However, he did not tolerate BIPAP and will continue it overnight with plans for weaning as tolerated.

The patient's altered mental status is improving significantly on current therapy, including lactulose and rifamixin. He is also being treated for hyponatremia, which is likely secondary to cirrhosis and possible type II hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has acute renal failure, likely hepatorenal, and is currently on hemodialysis (HD). His transaminase levels are elevated, and he has synthetic dysfunction due to acutely decompensated cirrhosis.

The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is currently admitting to recent drinking. Hepatitis serologies are negative, and further workup for liver disease is recommended. The patient has coagulopathy likely due to hepatic cirrhosis. He has been started on thiamine and folate supplementation. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with h/o HTN and COPD presented to the ED with SOB and was
   noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in ARF with
   hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and transaminitis / synthetic dysfunction.
   At baseline, he is A&Ox3 but now with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.
   Given nodular liver on CT, this is all consistent with acute hepatic
   decompensation resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output ARF
   and possible HRS. New developments include coffee ground emesis
    # Acute renal failure:  Likely secondary to liver failure, likely
   hepatorenal syndrome, type II.
   - Renal following
   - On midodrine and octreotide
   - Lasix gtt and bumex
   - Plan for HD today per renal
   # Respiratory distress: Likely [**3-6**] volume overload +/- HAP (see below).
   - BiPap
   - Lasix gtt with Bumex to temporize, plan for HD today
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need intubation for HD line placement
   # Elevated WBC: + urine culture.  Also with increased opacities on CXR,
   likely volume overload but will consider HAP if WBC count does not
   improve with Ampicillin.
   - Start Ampicillin
   - Change foley
   - Check blood cultures
   - Repeat CXR
   # Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed: Likely [**3-6**] hepatic dysfunction and
   coagulopathy.  Multiple episode of coffee ground emesis and hct drop-
   appears to have stopped for the time being.  Hemoptysis likely [**3-6**]
   aspirated GI blood.
   - NPO
   - No EGD given acute respiratory distress
   - On PPI.
   - q12 monitoring
   # Hyponatremia: Looks like hypervolemic hyponatremia from hepatic
   dysfuntion. Urine sodium of 10 despite lasix.  S/p tolvaptan.
   - Continue salt tablets and fluid restrict
   - q12h monitoring
   - spot urine checks not s/o nephrotic range proteinuria, but will
   obtain 24 hour urine for evaluation
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   # Altered mental status: Likely [**3-6**] hyponatermia, hepatorenal
   derangement, and hepatic encephalopathy.  No evidence of ETOH
   withdrawal.  Improved with lactulose.
   - Gradual correction of hyponatremia
   - Evaluation of Hepatic and renal failure as below
   - Rifaximin, TID lactulose
   # Cirrhosis:  H/o ETOH abuse, and has admitted to drinking recently
   - Appreciate hepatology consult
   - Continue Thiamine / Folate
   #HTN: Received nifedipine overnight.  Possibly related to ETOH
   withdrawal, but will avoid SIWA given mental status.
   - Continue nifedipine.
   # COPD with SOB/wheezing: Continue albuterol nebs.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be massively fluid overloaded, in acute renal failure (ARF) with hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and transaminitis/synthetic dysfunction. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he has coffee ground emesis.

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Acute renal failure: Likely secondary to liver failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome, type II. The patient is receiving midodrine and octreotide, lasix gtt, and bumex. A plan for hemodialysis (HD) today per renal has been made.

2. Respiratory distress: Likely volume overload +/- hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPap), lasix gtt with bumex, and is planned for HD today. Intubation for HD line placement is considered if needed.

3. Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count: + urine culture. The patient is starting ampicillin, and his Foley catheter will be changed. Blood cultures will be checked, and a repeat chest X-ray (CXR) will be done.

4. Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed: Likely hepatic dysfunction and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be massively fluid overloaded, with acute renal failure, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and transaminitis/synthetic dysfunction. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he has experienced episodes of coffee ground emesis. Imaging shows volume overload on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute renal failure: likely secondary to liver failure, possibly hepatorenal syndrome type II.
   - Renal follow-up
   - On midodrine and octreotide
   - Lasix gtt and bumex
   - Plan for hemodialysis (HD) today per renal

2. Respiratory distress: likely volume overload +/- healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP).
   - Bipap
   - Lasix gtt with Bumex to temporize, plan for HD today
   - Need intubation for HD line placement

3. Elevated WBC: + urine culture. Also with increased opacities on CXR, likely volume overload but will consider HAP if WBC count does not improve with Ampicillin.
   - Start Ampicillin
   - Change Foley
   - Check blood cultures
   - Repeat CXR

4. Acute blood loss anemia/GI"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with h/o HTN and COPD presented to the ED with SOB and was
   noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in ARF with
   hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and transaminitis / synthetic dysfunction.
   At baseline, he is A&Ox3 but now with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.
   Given nodular liver on CT, this is all consistent with acute hepatic
   decompensation resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output ARF
   and possible HRS. New developments include coffee ground emesis
    # Acute renal failure:  Likely secondary to liver failure, likely
   hepatorenal syndrome, type II.
   - Renal following
   - On midodrine and octreotide
   - Albumin and Lasix today
   # Elevated WBC: + urine culture.  Also with increased opacities on CXR,
   likely volume overload but will consider HAP if WBC count does not
   improve with Ampicillin.
   - Start Ampicillin
   - Change foley
   - Check blood cultures
   # Hyponatremia: Looks like hypervolemic hyponatremia from hepatic
   dysfuntion. Urine sodium of 10 despite lasix.  S/p tolvaptan.
   - Continue salt tablets and fluid restrict
   - Close monitoring of serum electrolytes and serum osm to avoid too
   rapid correction of hyponatremia
   - spot urine checks not s/o nephrotic range proteinuria, but will
   obtain 24 hour urine for evaluation
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   # Altered mental status: Likely [**3-6**] hyponatermia, hepatorenal
   derangement, and hepatic encephalopathy.  No evidence of ETOH
   withdrawal.  Improved with lactulose.
   - Gradual correction of hyponatremia
   - Evaluation of Hepatic and renal failure as below
   - Rifaximin, TID lactulose
   # Cirrhosis:  H/o ETOH abuse, and has admitted to drinking recently
   - Appreciate hepatology consult
   - Continue Thiamine / Folate
   #HTN: Received nifedipine overnight.  Possibly related to ETOH
   withdrawal, but will avoid SIWA given mental status.
   - Continue nifedipine.
   # Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed: Likely [**3-6**] hepatic dysfunction and
   coagulopathy.  Three episode of coffee ground emesis and hct drop-
   appears to have stopped for the time being
   - NPO for EGD / [**Last Name (un) **] (will clarify timing with hepatology)
   - On PPI.
   # COPD with SOB/wheezing: Continue albuterol.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be massively fluid overloaded, acute renal failure (ARF) with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, transaminitis, and synthetic dysfunction. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he is now experiencing coffee ground emesis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient's ARF is likely secondary to liver failure, possibly hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type II. This requires careful monitoring and management, including renal follow-up, midodrine, octreotide, albumin, and Lasix.

2. Elevated white blood cell count: The patient's elevated WBC count suggests an infection. A urine culture has been obtained, and ampicillin has been started. Additionally, the patient's Foley catheter needs to be changed, and blood cultures should be checked.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia appears to be hypervolemic due to hepatic dysfunction. Despite Lasix administration, the patient's urine sodium remains low. Tolvaptan has been given, and the plan is to continue salt tablets and fluid restriction while closely monitoring serum electrolytes and serum osmolarity to avoid rapid correction of hy"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with h/o HTN and COPD presented to the ED with SOB and was
   noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in ARF with
   hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and transaminitis / synthetic dysfunction.
   At baseline, he is A&Ox3 but now with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.
   Given nodular liver on CT, this is all consistent with acute hepatic
   decompensation resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output ARF
   and possible HRS. New developments include coffee ground emesis
    # Acute renal failure:  Likely secondary to liver failure, likely
   hepatorenal syndrome, type II.
   - Renal following
   - On midodrine and octreotide
   - Lasix gtt and bumex
   - Plan for HD today per renal
   # Respiratory distress: Likely [**3-6**] volume overload +/- HAP (see below).
   - BiPap
   - Lasix gtt with Bumex to temporize, plan for HD today
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need intubation for HD line placement
   # Elevated WBC: + urine culture.  Also with increased opacities on CXR,
   likely volume overload but will consider HAP if WBC count does not
   improve with Ampicillin.
   - Start Ampicillin
   - Change foley
   - Check blood cultures
   - Repeat CXR
   # Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed: Likely [**3-6**] hepatic dysfunction and
   coagulopathy.  Multiple episode of coffee ground emesis and hct drop-
   appears to have stopped for the time being.  Hemoptysis likely [**3-6**]
   aspirated GI blood.
   - NPO
   - No EGD given acute respiratory distress
   - On PPI.
   - q12 monitoring
   # Hyponatremia: Looks like hypervolemic hyponatremia from hepatic
   dysfuntion. Urine sodium of 10 despite lasix.  S/p tolvaptan.
   - Continue salt tablets and fluid restrict
   - q12h monitoring
   - spot urine checks not s/o nephrotic range proteinuria, but will
   obtain 24 hour urine for evaluation
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   # Altered mental status: Likely [**3-6**] hyponatermia, hepatorenal
   derangement, and hepatic encephalopathy.  No evidence of ETOH
   withdrawal.  Improved with lactulose.
   - Gradual correction of hyponatremia
   - Evaluation of Hepatic and renal failure as below
   - Rifaximin, TID lactulose
   # Cirrhosis:  H/o ETOH abuse, and has admitted to drinking recently
   - Appreciate hepatology consult
   - Continue Thiamine / Folate
   #HTN: Received nifedipine overnight.  Possibly related to ETOH
   withdrawal, but will avoid SIWA given mental status.
   - Continue nifedipine.
   # COPD with SOB/wheezing: Continue albuterol nebs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be massively fluid overloaded, experiencing acute renal failure with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. He also has transaminitis and synthetic dysfunction, along with nodular liver on CT, indicating acute hepatic decompensation. The patient's mental status has worsened, and he is now alert only for 3 out of 4. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has hepatorenal syndrome type II, which is secondary to liver failure.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has volume overload and possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He is on BiPap and receiving diuretics to manage his condition.
3. Elevated white blood cell count: There is suspicion of a urinary tract infection, and the patient has increased opacities on chest X-ray, indicating possible volume overload or HAP. Antibiotics have been started, and further investigations are planned.
4. Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed: The patient has multiple episodes of coffee ground emesis and a drop in hemoglobin levels, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding. He is at risk for further bleeding due to hepatic dysfunction and coagulopathy.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, and this"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath. He was found to be massively fluid overloaded, in acute renal failure with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, and experiencing synthetic dysfunction. The patient's baseline mental status has worsened, indicating acute hepatic decompensation resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia, low output acute renal failure, and possible hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type II. Other findings include coffee ground emesis, elevated white blood cell count with a positive urine culture, and increased opacities on chest X-ray suggestive of volume overload or possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient also has acute blood loss anemia likely due to hepatic dysfunction and coagulopathy, as well as hyponatremia, altered mental status, cirrhosis, hypertension, and COPD with shortness of breath and wheezing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient is likely experiencing liver failure, which may lead to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type II. This condition can cause renal dysfunction and may require renal replacement therapy.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to volume overload and/or HAP. Bipap support has been initiated, and diuretics are being used to manage"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient presented with acute respiratory distress this morning, likely due to fluid overload in the setting of cirrhosis and renal failure. Non-invasive ventilation was initiated, but the patient did not tolerate it well. Renal services were notified, and the patient underwent dialysis with ultrafiltration.

The patient also has altered mental status, which is improving significantly on current therapy, including lactulose and rifamixin. Hyponatremia is present and is likely hypervolemic in the setting of cirrhosis. There is a possibility of type II hepatorenal syndrome, and the sodium levels have improved after tolvaptan administration along with a significant amount of albumin. Renal services are following up on this.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely hepatorenal, oliguric, and now on hemodialysis (HD). Midodrine and octreotide have been initiated, and renal function should be closely monitored. Renal dosing of medications, avoiding nephrotoxins, and no IV contrast should be continued. Follow-up renal recommendations are provided.

The patient has evidence of transaminitis, elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with acute respiratory distress this morning, likely due to fluid overload in the setting of cirrhosis and renal failure. He was placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with good response. Renal services were notified, and the patient underwent interventional radiology (IR) guided dialysis catheter placement with successful dialysis in the afternoon. The patient did not tolerate removal of NIV. He has a history of decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and intolerance to NIV indicate a potential respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient had an episode of coffee ground emesis yesterday, which could suggest gastrointestinal bleeding. Continued monitoring and potential endoscopy when stable are recommended.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which require careful management to avoid complications such as seizures or neurological dysfunction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a possibility of acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Appropriate management including fluid restriction, avoiding neph"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-inch tall, 178.3 kg male who was admitted with respiratory distress and subsequently placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) due to intolerance to BiPAP. The patient underwent interventional radiology (IR) guided dialysis placement and started dialysis in the afternoon, with successful removal of 2L ultrafiltrate.

The patient has no known drug allergies and received antibiotics including ceftriaxone and ampicillin. Pantoprazole and heparin sodium infusions were also administered.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted respiratory distress. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/52 to 135/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on BiPAP. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance reveals a total intake of 1,674 mL, with 276 mL of IV fluids, 60 mL of PO intake, and 714 mL of blood products. Total output is 2,243 mL, including 900 mL of urine output. The patient's weight remains relatively unchanged from admission.

Respiratory support includes the use of BiPAP with settings of CPAP/PSV mode, VT of 1,110 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 21, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 19 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 94%. ABG results show pH of 7.21, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, PaO2 of 60 mmHg, HCO3- of 21 mEq/L, BE of -12 mEq/L, and O2 saturation of 92%. Ve is 13.3 L/min.

Physical examination findings are incomplete due to non-assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and other systems.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. Sodium levels are low, while potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels are within normal range. Glucose levels are within normal range as well.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, acute gastrointestinal bleed, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, and liver function abnormalities. The patient is on full code status and ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's disposition is pending further evaluation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient required non-invasive ventilation and is currently on CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and hyponatremia. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole, and ceftriaxone. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as elevated creatinine, liver enzymes, and lipase. The patient's blood cultures were taken on 12/8/2124 at 11:20 AM. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 569 mL since 12 AM. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with an elevated PCO2 level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration of lung function and potentially progress to ARDS.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and shock if not managed appropriately.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has respiratory distress, which was initially attributed to fluid overload due to anuria (lack of urine output) caused by hepatorenal syndrome. However, worsening leukocytosis (high white blood cell count) and chest X-ray appearance suggest hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Coverage for HAP is being provided with vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin. The patient is continuing with non-invasive ventilation (BIPAP) as tolerated and dialysis in the morning.

The patient also has an enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI), for which ampicillin is being discontinued, and HAP coverage will suffice. The patient's altered mental status, which was consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, is improving significantly on current therapy. Lactulose and rifaximin are to be continued. The patient has hyponatremia, which is hypervolemic in the setting of cirrhosis. This may be type II hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's sodium levels improved after receiving tolvaptan, although a significant amount of albumin was also administered. Renal function is being monitored.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely hepatorenal, oliguric (low urine output), and is now on hemodialysis (HD). Midodrine and octreotide are to be continued. Renal function should be monitored, and medications should be dosed accordingly, avoiding nephrotoxins and no IV contrast. The patient is to continue with HD and follow-up renal recommendations.

The patient has transminitis (elevated transaminases), elevated bilirubin, and synthetic dysfunction, indicating acutely decompensated cirrhosis. The patient recently admitted to drinking alcohol. Hepatitis serologies, viral hepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis have been ruled out. The patient is to receive midodrine, octreotide, lactulose, and rifaximin. Follow-up hepatology recommendations are provided.

The patient has a coagulopathy, likely due to hepatic cirrhosis. The patient's history of ethanol abuse is noted, and thiamine and folate supplementation are recommended. The patient had an episode of coffee ground emesis yesterday, but none today. The hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is stable. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prophylaxis is recommended, and gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is to be performed when the patient is stable.

The patient is currently nil per os (NPO), meaning nothing by mouth. Prophylactic PPI is being provided. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU care."

   male with schizophrenia admitted with anasarca, hyponatremia, and acute
   renal failure with evidence of new liver synthetic function. Broad
   consensus is that there was pre-existing liver cirrhosis which acutely
   decompensated likely from alcohol ingestion. Other hospital events
   notable for hepatic encephalopathy and coffee grds emesis- latter
   spont. Resolved and EGD not performed due to pt
s then-marginal mental
   status.
   Though hyponatremia and mental status improving, renal function
   worsening with pulmonary edema- likely HRS. In this context, pt
   developed worsening acute respiratory distress now on NIPPV. HD started
   yesterday, but with persistent bilateral infiltrates and worsening
   tachypnea despite fluid removal. Suspect he may have aspirated- abx
   coverage broadened to include HAP organisms.
   Plan to continue support with NIPPV, remove fluid as tolerated by HD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse. The patient presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have volume overload, hepatic cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely secondary to alcohol ingestion. The hospital course was complicated by acute mental status changes (AMS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring BiPap, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to volume overload with possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient is being supported with BiPap as needed, but may require intubation in the near future if respiratory failure continues and cannot tolerate necessary BiPap.

The elevated white blood cell count (WBC) from 8 to 13 to 15 is of unclear etiology, including worsening pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infection (UTI), or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Broadened antibiotic coverage has been initiated to cover pneumonia, including aspiration source with poor dentition, SBP, and UTI.

Other lab results show a hematocrit (Hct) of 28 decreasing to 25, suggesting blood loss, possibly from coffee-ground emesis. The patient's creatinine levels have"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, hepatic cirrhosis with acute decompensation likely due to alcohol use, hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring BiPap, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload with possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA). BiPap should be continued as needed, and intubation may be required if the patient cannot tolerate necessary BiPap.
2. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC): The etiology of the elevated WBC is unclear, including worsening PNA, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and Clostridium difficile infection. Broaden antibiotic coverage to vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin (covering PNA, including aspiration source with poor dentition, SBP).
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (hct) has decreased from 28 to 25. A packed red blood cell transfusion may be necessary.
4. Acute kidney injury with possible hepatorenal syndrome: Continue octreotide and midodrine. Hemodialysis (HD) is planned for net -4L. Monitor sodium levels closely, and consider tolvaptan renal/toolvaptan if needed.
5. Hypotension: Monitor blood pressure closely and provide appropriate fluid resuscitation if necessary.
6. Other complications: Monitor for signs of sepsis, monitor liver function tests, and monitor electrolyte levels, especially sodium. Consider broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infections."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU. He has acute decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to fluid overload, worsening leukocytosis, and a chest X-ray suggestive of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He is currently on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), and antibiotics have been started for HAP coverage. The patient also has an enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI), which requires discontinuation of ampicillin. His altered mental status is improving on current therapy for hepatic encephalopathy. He has hyponatremia, possibly type II hepatorenal syndrome, which improved after administration of tolvaptan and albumin. The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) for acute renal failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome. He has acute decompensated cirrhosis with transaminitis, elevated bilirubin, and synthetic dysfunction. The patient has a history of recent ethanol abuse and is being monitored for coagulopathy, coffee ground emesis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is on stress ulcer prophylaxis and has a full code status."

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath. The patient has been intubated due to worsening respiratory distress and is receiving non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).

The patient has been started on coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Ampicillin, which was previously given for urinary tract infection (UTI), and ceftriaxone, given for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), have been discontinued.

The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) and had another session scheduled. Clostridium difficile (CDiff) has been sent for testing.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/47 mmHg to 137/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient's weight is 178.3 kg, and height is 70 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 810 mL and output of 80 mL, resulting in a negative balance"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He developed worsening respiratory fatigue earlier today and needed
   intubation. He will need continued help with fluid removal ( ? daily HD
   for now) and we will adjust PEEP/ FiO2 to help with ventilation and
   oxygenation. He does not appear to have any significant urine output.
   He is now on broader coverage for HAP which has been dose adjusted for
   creatinine clearance.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","The patient's chief complaints include respiratory failure, renal failure, and hepatic failure. The patient has a history of hypertension, COPD, and alcohol abuse. The patient presented with shortness of breath, volume overload, cirrhosis with acute decompensation likely due to alcohol abuse. The hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring BiPap, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient required intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, anticoagulation therapy, and medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient's physical examination shows distant heart sounds, reduced breath sounds bilaterally, and bilateral rhonchi. The patient has distended abdomen with positive bowel sounds, peripheral edema in both lower extremities, and non-focal neurologic examination.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results show electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia and hypokalemia.

The patient's assessment includes hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to volume overload with possible aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia, elevated white blood cell count with unclear etiology, and acute kidney disease with"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse presenting with shortness of breath. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by acute myocardial syndrome (AMS) likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring BiPap, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 89%) and respiratory rate (RR: 17 insp/min) indicate respiratory distress. This may be due to volume overload with possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA).

2. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC): The patient's WBC count has increased from 8 to 13 to 15, indicating a possible infection such as pneumonia (PNA), sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), or Clostridium difficile (C Diff).

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have decreased from 28 to 25, indicating a need for further investigation and treatment.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKD): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 3.1 to 4.8, suggesting possible hepatorenal syndrome due to liver dysfunction.

5. HypoNa: The patient's sodium levels are low, which needs to be carefully monitored"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse.
- The patient presented with shortness of breath and was found to have volume overload, likely secondary to cirrhosis with acute decompensation, possibly due to alcohol use.
- Hospital course has been complicated by acute myocardial syndrome (AMS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring BiPap, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.
- The patient is now intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to volume overload with possible aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels.
- The patient has been started on vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia, including aspiration source with poor dentition, and also for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- Further investigations, including urine analysis and culture, stool culture, C. diff toxin, and blood cultures, have been ordered.
- The patient's low sodium levels are being monitored and managed appropriately.
- Nutritional support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ETOH abuse presenting with respiratory failure, renal failure, and hepatic failure. He has been experiencing shortness of breath and volume overload, along with cirrhosis with acute decompensation likely due to alcohol abuse. The hospital course has been complicated by AMS likely hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring BiPap, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to volume overload with possible aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
2. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC): The WBC count has been increasing from 8 to 13 to 15 to 18, which could be due to worsening pneumonia, sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), or Clostridium difficile infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have fluctuated between 25.7% and 27.6%, indicating anemia. It is unclear if this is due to blood loss or decreased production. Blood transfusion may be required.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has developed AKI, which could be related to hepat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU. He has acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has shown respiratory failure. He also has gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and coagulopathy.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress has been attributed to fluid overload and possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Appropriate coverage for HAP has been initiated.
2. Enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI): Discontinue ampicillin, and HAP coverage will suffice. A 14-day course of antibiotics is planned.
3. Altered mental status/hepatic encephalopathy: Improving significantly on current therapy, including lactulose and rifamixin. Continued monitoring is necessary.
4. Hyponatremia: Resolving with tolvaptan and albumin administration. Renal function should be monitored, and daily chem 10 should be followed.
5. Acute renal failure: Likely hepatorenal, oliguric, and now on hemodialysis (HD). Continue midodrine and octreotide, monitor renal function, adjust medications accordingly, avoid nephrotoxins"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU. The patient has decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient previously experienced fluid overload in the setting of anuria (lack of urine output) due to hepatorenal syndrome. However, worsening leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) and chest X-ray appearance suggest the possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
   - Coverage for HAP is planned with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin starting on day 3. The anaerobic coverage is sufficient with zosyn, and Clostridium difficile infection should be checked.
   - A CT torso evaluation is recommended.

2. Enterococcal UTI: The planned antibiotic coverage for HAP will also cover enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI).

3. Altered mental status/Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is improving significantly on current therapy.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels are resolving, which is likely due to hypervolemic hyponatremia in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and alcohol abuse.
- He presented with shortness of breath and was found to have volume overload, cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely due to alcohol use.
- The hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.
- The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypothermia, and low blood pressure.
- The plan includes continuing antibiotics, obtaining sputum culture, conducting a torso CT, holding beta-blockers, and discussing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with the gastroenterology team.
- The patient also has a declining hematocrit, likely due to coffee-ground emesis, and will continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
- Other concerns include acute kidney disease (AKD) with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury (ATI), hypo sodium levels, and the need for ICU care.
- Nutrition support will be initiated, and glycemic control will be monitored.
- Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a PPI, and ventil"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He presented with shortness of breath and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to various complications.

The patient's chief complaints include hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), and possible hepatorenal syndrome. He also has elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, and worsening liver function tests.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure (86/40 mmHg), low heart rate (56 bpm), normal respiratory rate (24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 26 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels, low sodium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals improving pulmonary edema but missing most of the left chest on the window.

The assessment and plan include the patient's ongoing hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to volume overload with possible aspiration or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). He is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and lev"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ETOH abuse. He presents with shortness of breath and is found to have volume overload, cirrhosis with acute decompensation likely due to alcohol abuse, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has been intubated for respiratory failure, which may be secondary to aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is also experiencing hypothermia, low blood pressure, and declining hematocrit. There are concerns about infection/sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if he develops further complications such as pneumonia or if the aspiration continues.
2. Infection/Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and fever could indicate an infection, which could progress to sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's declining hematocrit suggests ongoing bleeding, possibly from coffee-ground emesis. This could lead to further blood loss and anemia.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure seen in advanced liver disease.
5. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's low platelet count and prolonged clotting times may suggest the development of DIC, a condition characterized by"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multifocal pneumonia, minimal ascites, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 121/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is complicated by acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities, and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels indicate possible renal impairment, which can worsen if not appropriately managed.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests show abnormalities, indicating potential liver injury or dysfunction.
6. Hypotension: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's respiratory distress was initially attributed to fluid overload due to anuria (lack of urine output) associated with hepatorenal syndrome. However, worsening leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) and chest X-ray appearance suggest possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Coverage for HAP was started on day 3 with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin (anaerobic coverage sufficient with zosyn); check for Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient also had an enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI), which will be covered by the HAP antibiotics. The plan is for a 14-day course of antibiotics. The patient's altered mental status, attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, is improving significantly on current therapy, including lactulose and rifamixin. Hyponatremia (low sodium levels) is resolving in the context of cirrhosis, possibly type II hepatorenal syndrome. Acute renal failure is likely hepatorenal, oliguric (low urine output), and the patient is now on hemodialysis (HD). Renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU. He presented with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has now developed multifocal pneumonia (PNA) and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient has respiratory distress previously attributed to fluid overload. However, recent CT torso shows multifocal hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
   - Coverage for HAP started on day 4 with vancomycin and cefepime.
   - High PEEP is required to maintain oxygenation due to the patient's body habitus. If higher PEEP is needed, an esophageal balloon will be obtained.

2. Enterococcal UTI: HAP coverage with vancomycin and cefepime will suffice.
   - A 14-day course of antibiotics is planned starting from day 1.

3. Altered Mental Status/Hepatic Encephalopathy: Improved significantly on current therapy but now unable to assess lingering effects of sedation.
   - Continue lactulose and rifamixin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He presented with shortness of breath and was found to have volume overload, cirrhosis with acute decompensation likely due to ethanol abuse. The hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status changes (AMS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This is likely due to volume overload with possible aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently intubated.
2. Hypothermia and low blood pressure: There is concern for infection/sepsis. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, and cultures are pending.
3. Declining hematocrit: This is likely due to coffee-ground emesis.
4. Acute kidney disease (AKD) with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury (ATI): The patient is receiving octreotide and midodrine, and hemodialysis is being considered.
5. HypoNa: The patient's sodium levels are low, and it is important to monitor and manage this condition carefully.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further deterioration in respiratory status: The patient's respiratory function may continue to worsen due to underlying"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ETOH abuse. He presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and is found to have volume overload, cirrhosis with acute decompensation likely due to alcohol abuse, and hospital course complicated by AMS (acute mental status changes) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, coffee-ground emesis, acute kidney dysfunction with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury, hypotension, cirrhosis, and hyponatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. If the respiratory function does not improve or worsens, it may lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the history of coffee-ground emesis and the presence of respiratory failure, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. This can be a serious infection that may require additional interventions.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's cirrhosis and acute renal failure raise concerns about hepatorenal syndrome. This condition can lead to worsening kidney function and potentially irreversible damage.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse. He presented with shortness of breath and was found to have volume overload, likely due to fluid accumulation in the lungs. He also has cirrhosis with acute decompensation, possibly exacerbated by alcohol use. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status (AMS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload with aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Intubation has been performed to support his breathing.
2. Coffee-ground emesis: The patient has been experiencing coffee-ground emesis, which can indicate ongoing bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been initiated to reduce stomach acid production.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury (ATI): The patient's kidney function has deteriorated, and there is suspicion of hepatorenal syndrome or ATI. Treatment includes octreotide, midodrine, and hemodialysis (HD).
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and antihypertensive medications have been"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. Currently, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to multifocal pneumonia (PNA) and has developed acute respiratory failure. He also has gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and hyponatremia.

The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to fluid overload in the setting of anuria (lack of urine output) caused by hepatorenal syndrome. However, a recent CT torso suggests the development of multifocal hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Coverage for HAP has been initiated with vancomycin and cefepime. The patient requires high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maintain oxygenation, which is not surprising given his body habitus (overweight/obese). If higher PEEP is needed, an esophageal balloon will be obtained.

The patient also has an enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI), which will be covered by the HAP antibiotics. The plan is for a 14-day course of antibiotics. Additionally, the patient's altered mental status/ hepatic encephalopathy has improved significantly on current therapy but is now unable"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old overweight/obese male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, liver function abnormalities, and hypotension. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and has been receiving various medications including ceftriaxone and vancomycin for suspected sepsis. Blood cultures have been taken and fungal x1 was positive. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure within normal ranges. The patient's weight has increased from 175.1 kg at admission to 178.3 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 5,685 mL. The patient is receiving nutritional support through NovaSource Renal (Full) at 20 mL/hour.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): Given the presence of a PICC line and potential for central venous catheterization, there is a risk of developing CRBSI.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and the presence of obesity increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient now presents with multifocal pneumonia (PNA) and respiratory distress due to fluid overload and PNA. The patient is intubated and currently in respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Multifocal Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has developed multifocal hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is a serious complication requiring immediate treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to fluid overload and PNA. Weaning off ventilation will be continued as tolerated.
3. Enterococcal UTI: The patient has a concurrent enterococcal urinary tract infection. Coverage for HAP will also suffice.
4. Altered Mental Status/Hepatic Encephalopathy: Although the patient's mental status has improved significantly on current therapy, lingering effects of sedation cannot be assessed. The patient will continue with lactulose and rifamixin.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has hepatorenal syndrome, presenting as acute renal failure. The patient is now on hemodialysis (HD) and fluid removal will continue.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M (h/o hypertension, COPD, ETOH abuse) p/w SOB, volume overload, new
   diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely [**3-6**] EtOH.
   Hospital course complicated by AMS likely [**3-6**] hepatic encephalopathy,
   coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly [**3-6**] hepatorenal
   syndrome.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely due to volume overload with
   aspiration / HAP. Intubated.
   - Continue vanc/levo/cefepime
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated, would not ween PEEP any further as likely
   needs high PEEP to offset chest wall edema and obesity
   - Bronchodilators
   #AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI:
   - Discuss d/c
ing octreotide and midodrine per renal.
   - Continue daily HD to remove large amount of fluid
   - Daily bladder pressure
   # Hypotension / Elevated WBC count/ Hypothermia: Extensive infectious
   work-up with only evidence of possible PNA that is being adequately
   covered.
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Hold anti-HTN
   - F/u fungal cultures, check c. diff
   Will perform BAL today to assess secretions RLL
   Cortisol is inappropriately low for amount of stress but still loathe
   to start steroids until fungal cultures are clear and no e/o
   enterocolitis
   # Cirrhosis: Acute decompensation likely [**3-6**] ETOH abuse.
   - Will follow
   - Continue lactulose
   - Thiamine/Folate
   # Coffee ground emesis:
   - Continue PO PPI [**Hospital1 7**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol abuse, and newly diagnosed cirrhosis presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, and acute renal failure. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by acute myocardial syndrome (AMS) likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is currently critically ill and requires ongoing management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to volume overload with aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Intubation has been performed, and the plan is to wean FiO2 as tolerated while maintaining high PEEP to offset chest wall edema and obesity.
2. Acute Kidney Disease (AKD) with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury (ATI): The patient's AKD may be related to hepatorenal syndrome or ATI. The plan includes discussing discontinuation of octreotide and midodrine per renal, continuing daily hemodialysis (HD) to remove large amounts of fluid, and monitoring daily bladder pressure.
3. Hypotension/Elevated WBC count/Hypothermia: The patient has hypotension, elevated white blood cell count, and hypothermia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse. He presented with shortness of breath and was found to have volume overload, cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely due to ethanol abuse. The hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status change likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to volume overload with aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Intubation has been initiated, and FiO2 will be weaned as tolerated. PEEP may be required to offset chest wall edema.
2. Coffee ground emesis: The patient has been experiencing coffee-ground emesis, which could be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been continued, and a daily hemoglobin check will be performed. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been deferred to an unspecified future date.
3. Acute kidney dysfunction (AKD) with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury (ATI): The patient's renal function may be compromised, and there is a possibility of hepatorenal syndrome or ATI. Octreotide and midodrine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and alcohol abuse. He presented with shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation. The hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status changes, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload with aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. It is important to continue weaning FiO2 as tolerated but not to wean PEEP further as high PEEP may be needed to offset chest wall edema and obesity.
2. Acute Kidney Injury with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury: The patient has acute kidney injury with a rising creatinine level. There is a possibility of hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury. Discussion regarding discontinuing octreotide and midodrine per renal is planned. Daily hemodialysis will continue to remove a large amount of fluid, and daily bladder pressure monitoring will be done.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension despite receiving antibiotics. An extensive infectious work-up has shown evidence of possible pneumonia that is being adequately covered. Continuing antibiotics,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is now presenting with multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure from fluid overload and pneumonia. Weaning off ventilation will be a priority as tolerated.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. He is already on hemodialysis and will continue with this treatment. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly will be important.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and it is crucial to monitor his hemoglobin levels regularly. Further evaluation of the source of bleeding may be necessary.
4. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has liver function abnormalities due to alcoholic cirrhosis. It is essential to manage his condition with appropriate medications and monitor his liver function tests.
5. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which requires appropriate antibiotic coverage. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary.
6. Hyponatremia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fevers, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and was found to have hemorrhagic secretions in the right lower lobe. He received octreotide and midodrine. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on hydralazine. He also has a drug rash all over his back, for which he was given benadryl and topical hydrocortisone. His allergies are noted as no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime. His vital signs show hypertension with a blood pressure range of 157/54 to 185/106 mmHg, tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. The patient's weight is 178.3 kg, and he is receiving total parenteral nutrition through a PICC line and a dialysis catheter. Laboratory results indicate renal failure, liver function abnormalities, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, hydralazine, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory failure from fluid overload and pneumonia (PNA). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by fluid overload and PNA. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not managed properly.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, which is a form of kidney failure that occurs in patients with advanced liver disease. This condition can lead to worsening renal function and may require dialysis.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, known as hyponatremia. This can cause various symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and even coma if not corrected.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease. This condition can cause altered mental status, confusion, and other neurological symptoms.

5. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which increases the risk of further infection and respiratory complications.

6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient now has multifocal pneumonia (PNA) and respiratory failure due to fluid overload and PNA. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status (not delirium)
2. Hypertension, benign
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
4. Gastrointestinal bleed, other (GI bleed, GIB)
5. Hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality)
6. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
7. Liver function abnormalities

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia (PNA)
2. Respiratory failure from fluid overload and PNA
3. Hepatorenal syndrome
4. Hyponatremia
5. Hepatic encephalopathy
6. Acute renal failure
7. Gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed, GIB)
8. Hypertension
9. Liver function abnormalities

Note: The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems."

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient now presents with multifocal pneumonia (PNA), respiratory distress, and altered mental status.

The patient has been intubated for respiratory failure from fluid overload and PNA. Ventilation is being weaned as tolerated, and coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime. PEEP has been decreased from 14 to 10 and will continue to be weaned as tolerated.

The patient also has an enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI), for which HAP coverage will suffice. A 14-day course of antibiotics has been planned.

Altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, has improved significantly on current therapy but may be affected by lingering sedation. Lactulose and rifaximin will be continued.

Acute renal failure is suspected to be hepatorenal in origin, with oliguria. Hemodialysis (HD) has been initiated, and fluid removal of 6 liters was performed yesterday. Another 6 liters will be removed today. Midodrine and octreotide will be continued, and the patient will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU for acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has now developed multifocal pneumonia (PNA) and is intubated for respiratory failure due to fluid overload and PNA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing management with dialysis are necessary.
3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has developed multifocal pneumonia, which may require broad-spectrum antibiotics and further diagnostic evaluation, such as imaging studies and cultures.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be exacerbated by infections, electrolyte imbalances, or medication interactions. Monitoring for changes in mental status and ongoing management with lactulose and rifaximin are important.
5. Coffee Ground Emesis: The patient had an episode of coffee ground emesis, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU. He has acute decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient now has multifocal pneumonia (PNA) and is intubated due to respiratory failure from fluid overload and PNA. He also has a suspected enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI), altered mental status/hepatic encephalopathy, acute renal failure (likely hepatorenal), transaminitis, elevated bilirubin/synthetic dysfunction, and a history of ethanol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has developed multifocal pneumonia, which may require additional antibiotic coverage and could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms.
3. Enterococcal UTI: The patient has a suspected enterococcal UTI, which needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
4. Altered Mental Status/Hepatic Encephalopathy: Although the patient's mental status has improved significantly, there is still a risk of lingering effects of sedation and potential hepatic encephalopathy recurrence.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M (h/o hypertension, COPD, ETOH abuse) p/w SOB, volume overload, new
   diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely [**3-6**] EtOH.
   Hospital course complicated by AMS likely [**3-6**] hepatic encephalopathy,
   coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly [**3-6**] hepatorenal
   syndrome.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely due to volume overload with
   aspiration / HAP. Intubated.
   - Continue vanc/levo/cefepime
   - Wean to PSV 5/15, likely needs high PEEP to offset chest wall edema
   and obesity
 but can try weaning over weekend if tolerating PSV
   - Bronchodilators
   #AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI:
   - Continue daily HD to remove large amount of fluid
   - Daily bladder pressure
   # Hypotension / Elevated WBC count/ Hypothermia: Extensive infectious
   work-up with only evidence of possible PNA that is being adequately
   covered.
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Hold anti-HTN
   - F/u fungal cultures, BAL, c. diff
   - Cortisol is inappropriately low for amount of stress but not start
   steroids until fungal cultures are clear and no e/o enterocolitis
   # Cirrhosis: Acute decompensation likely [**3-6**] ETOH abuse.
   - Will follow
   - Continue lactulose
   - Thiamine/Folate
   # Coffee ground emesis:
   - Continue PO PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Daily Hct
   - EGD deferred to unspecified future date
   #HypoNa: S/p tolvaptan.  Now stable, check qday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, and likely alcohol intoxication. The hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload with aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The plan is to continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime. Weaning to pressure support ventilation (PSV) may be attempted over the weekend if tolerated.
2. Acute kidney disease (AKD) with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury (ATI): The patient requires daily hemodialysis (HD) to remove a large amount of fluid and monitor bladder pressure. The infectious work-up shows evidence of possible pneumonia that is being adequately covered with antibiotics.
3. Hypotension / Elevated white blood cell count / Hypothermia: The patient has hypotension, an elevated WBC count, and hypothermia. An extensive infectious work-up has been"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ethanol abuse, and now presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely alcoholic hepatitis. The hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status change likely hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to volume overload with aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Antibiotics have been continued to cover for possible infections. Bronchodilators have been given as well.

The patient also has acute kidney dysfunction with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury. Discussions regarding discontinuing octreotide and midodrine per renal have been made. Daily hemodialysis is being performed to remove large amounts of fluid, and daily bladder pressure is monitored.

Hypotension, elevated white blood cell count, and hypothermia have been noted. An extensive infectious work-up has been performed, showing only evidence of possible pneumonia that is being adequately covered. Antibiotics have been continued, and anti-hypertensive medications have been held. Fungal cultures are being followed, and c. difficile testing is pending.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, and new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status change likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload with aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation parameters are necessary. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be considered over the weekend if the patient tolerates pressure support ventilation (PSV) with high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to counteract chest wall edema and obesity.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) with possible hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has AKI with possible hepatorenal syndrome. Daily hemodialysis (HD) should be continued to remove a large amount of fluid, and daily bladder pressure monitoring should be performed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ETOH abuse. He presented with shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation. His hospital course has been complicated by AMS likely hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to volume overload with aspiration/HAP. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection or drug reaction, especially considering the recent rash.
3. AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI: The patient has acute kidney dysfunction and there is a possibility of hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury. He is receiving daily hemodialysis to remove excess fluid.
4. Hypotension/Hypothermia: The patient has been hypotensive and hypothermic, with an extensive infectious work-up showing only possible pneumonia that is being adequately covered. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further investigations such as fungal cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage, and Clostridium difficile testing should be done.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has acute decompensation of cir"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, and likely alcohol-related liver disease.
- The hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 97%.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and altered liver function tests.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (vanc, levo, cefepime), bronchodilators, diuretics, and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
- The plan includes weaning off mechanical ventilation, continuing dialysis, monitoring for fungal infections, and managing cirrhosis-related complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Due to volume overload with aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury.
3. Hypotension: Extensive"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M (h/o hypertension, COPD, ETOH abuse) p/w SOB, volume overload, new
   diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely [**3-6**] EtOH.
   Hospital course complicated by AMS likely [**3-6**] hepatic encephalopathy,
   coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly [**3-6**] hepatorenal
   syndrome.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely due to volume overload with
   aspiration / HAP. Intubated.
   - Completed 8 days of Vanco/Levo/Cefepime
   - Wean to PSV 5/15, likely needs high PEEP to offset chest wall edema
   and obesity
 doing well, will try on PSV 5/10
   - Bronchodilators
   # Leukocytosis: Consider on-going infection, drug reaction (in light of
   rash).  Last diff w/elevated Eosinophils.
   - Add on differential to AM CBC, re-send UA and UCx
   - Continue vanco for 14 days for enterococcus
   - Stop cefepime, levo
   - ABD US for hepatic abscess, ascites, portal vein flow
   #AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI:
   - Continue daily HD to remove large amount of fluid
   - Daily bladder pressure
   # Hypotension / Hypothermia: Extensive infectious work-up with only
   evidence of possible PNA that is being adequately covered.
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Hold anti-HTN
   - F/u fungal cultures, BAL, c. diff
   - Cortisol is inappropriately low for amount of stress but not start
   steroids until fungal cultures are clear and no e/o enterocolitis
   # Cirrhosis: Acute decompensation likely [**3-6**] ETOH abuse.  Now has
   worsening transaminitis.  Concern for portal vein clot, obstruction
   - Abd US for obstruction, portal vein clot
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - Thiamine/Folate
   # Coffee ground emesis:
   - Continue PO PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Daily Hct
   - EGD deferred to unspecified future date
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
    # Thrombocytopenia/HIT+: Platelets down this AM.
   - Re-discuss anticoag with heme, also discuss transfusion parameters
   - Recheck Plt count in PM
   - HD all done with citrate
   #HypoNa: S/p tolvaptan.  Now stable, check qday.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He presents with shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, and likely 3-6 units of ethanol intake. The hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status changes (AMS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload with aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or drug reaction, especially considering the recent rash.
3. AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury: The patient has acute kidney injury with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury. He is receiving daily hemodialysis to remove excess fluid.
4. Hypotension/hypothermia: The patient has evidence of possible pneumonia that is being adequately covered by antibiotics. His low cortisol levels need to be addressed, but steroids should not be started until fungal cultures are clear and there is no evidence of enterocolitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old overweight/obese male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, liver function abnormalities, and renal failure.

On admission, the patient was found to have acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and sepsis secondary to gastrointestinal bleed. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation in the emergency department.

Since admission, the patient's condition has been complicated by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, acute liver injury, and worsening renal function. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and decreased platelet count.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 148/55 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2, and temperature within normal range. However, the patient remains sedated and unresponsive.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 343 mL since midnight, indicating ongoing fluid loss. His urine output has been low at 20 mL since midnight. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7."

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ethanol abuse admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. He now presents with multifocal pneumonia (PNA) and respiratory failure. The patient has a positive HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) antibody test and is being evaluated for the risks and benefits of anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hepatitis: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels and transaminase activity, which may indicate liver dysfunction or hepatitis. Monitoring liver function and following hepatology recommendations will be important in managing this complication.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome. Monitoring renal function and continuing with scheduled hemodialysis sessions are essential to manage this complication.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adjusting ventilator settings as needed will be necessary to prevent further complications.

4. Infection: The patient has developed multifocal pneumonia and a positive culture for enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI). Antibiotic therapy should be continued to treat these infections and prevent further complications.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient now presents with rapidly rising transaminitis and leukocytosis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. RASH - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
2. Altered mental status (not delirium)
3. Hypertension, benign
4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
5. Gastrointestinal bleed, other (GI bleed, GIB)
6. Hyponatremia (low sodium, hyponatremia)
7. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
8. Liver function abnormalities

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that occurs when the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and gastrointestinal infection. These infections can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which can be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy, along with multifocal pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory failure from fluid overload and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
2. Acute respiratory failure (due to fluid overload and pneumonia)
3. Multifocal hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
4. Enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI)
5. Hepatic encephalopathy
6. Acute renal failure (likely hepatorenal)
7. Transminitis (elevated liver enzymes)
8. Potential intrahepatic abscess, biliary obstruction, and hepatic vein thrombosis
9. Coffee ground emesis (suggestive of upper gastrointestinal bleeding)
10. Malnutrition due to poor oral intake and tube feeds

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and altered mental status. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, ascites, gallbladder sludge, and cholelithiasis. Imaging shows patent but reversed flow in the main, right, and left portal vein, with a recanalized umbilical vein. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (levofloxacin and cefepime), but continues to have a fever and altered mental status. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. The patient also has hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, and liver function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatitis: Given the elevated liver enzymes and history of cirrhosis, there is a potential for hepatitis, which can worsen liver function and lead to further complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and altered mental status despite antibiotic treatment suggest the possibility of sepsis, especially considering the elevated white blood cell count and pending blood cultures.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The altered mental status in the context of liver dysfunction raises concern for hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that can occur due to the buildup of toxins in the bloodstream when the liver is unable to adequately filter them.
4. Kidney injury: The acute renal failure indicated by the elevated creatinine level"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and alcohol abuse presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome, and leukocytosis with worsening transaminitis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Intubated and receiving antibiotics. Will try weaning from mechanical ventilation today, aiming for extubation after hemodialysis tomorrow if the patient does well.
2. Cirrhosis: Acute decompensation likely due to alcohol abuse. The patient's abdominal ultrasound was negative for obstruction or portal vein clot. Further studies are needed to rule out vascular processes. The differential diagnosis includes drug or infection-related causes.
3. Leukocytosis: Consider ongoing infection or drug reaction. Urine analysis with white blood cells will be performed, and antibiotic coverage will be changed to cover gram-negative bacteria.
4. AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI: The patient will receive a hemodialysis holiday today and have daily bladder pressure monitoring.
5. Hypotension/Hypothermia: Extensive infectious work-up with only evidence of possible pneumonia that is being adequately covered"

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely due to volume overload with
   aspiration / HAP. Intubated.
   - Completed 8 days of Vanco/Levo/Cefepime
   - Wean to PSV 5/15, likely needs high PEEP to offset chest wall edema
   and obesity
 doing well, will try on PSV 5/10
   - Bronchodilators
   # Leukocytosis: Consider on-going infection, drug reaction (in light of
   rash).  Last diff w/elevated Eosinophils.
   - Add on differential to AM CBC, re-send UA and UCx
   - Continue vanco for 14 days for enterococcus
   - Stop cefepime, levo
   - ABD US for hepatic abscess, ascites, portal vein flow
   #AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI:
   - Continue daily HD to remove large amount of fluid
   - Daily bladder pressure
   # Hypotension / Hypothermia: Extensive infectious work-up with only
   evidence of possible PNA that is being adequately covered.
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Hold anti-HTN
   - F/u fungal cultures, BAL, c. diff
   - Cortisol is inappropriately low for amount of stress but not start
   steroids until fungal cultures are clear and no e/o enterocolitis
   # Cirrhosis: Acute decompensation likely [**3-6**] ETOH abuse.  Now has
   worsening transaminitis.  Concern for portal vein clot, obstruction
   - Abd US for obstruction, portal vein clot
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - Thiamine/Folate
   # Coffee ground emesis:
   - Continue PO PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Daily Hct
   - EGD deferred to unspecified future date
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
    # Thrombocytopenia/HIT+: Platelets down this AM.
   - Re-discuss anticoag with heme, also discuss transfusion parameters
   - Recheck Plt count in PM
   - HD all done with citrate

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ETOH abuse. He presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, and likely alcoholic hepatitis. The hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to volume overload with aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an ongoing infection or a drug reaction. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
3. AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI: The patient has acute kidney dysfunction, which may be secondary to hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury. Daily hemodialysis is being performed to remove excess fluid.
4. Hypotension/Hypothermia: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure and body temperature. An extensive infectious work-up has been conducted, revealing possible pneumonia that is being adequately covered with antibiotics.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has acute decompensation of cirrhosis, likely due to alcohol abuse. There is worsening transam"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications, including hepatic dysfunction, renal failure, hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and thrombocytopenia.

24-hour events include the onset of atrial fibrillation, unplanned extubation initiated by the patient, conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm with diltiazem, and initiation of diltiazem PO QID. Cardiac enzymes show normal levels, and liver function tests are improving. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, thrombocytopenia, and previous antibiotic use.

Vital signs remain relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/48 mmHg to 148/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is tolerating face vent support after self-extubation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,050 mL and output of 700 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 350 mL.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 48 K"

   # Worsening leukocytosis: Unclear source at this time.  Patient has now
   completed course for HAP.  Urine Cx on [**12-4**] grew Vano sensitive
   Enterococcus, and he has been on Vancomycin since that time.  UA
   yesterday with +WBC and bacteria but patient also anuric so unclear if
   this represents a real infection.  Will await Ucx results and start
   Zosyn.  RUQ U/S done yesterday showed no abscess and no biliary
   process.  Will obtain CT vs MRI abdomen today for better evaluation
   --Glucan resent, galactomannam negative, fungal cxs pending.
   --Cdiff ruled out [**12-15**]
   --Per discussion with gi, will obtain imaging of liver to assess for
   clot vs infection
   -- cont Vanco, add Zosyn for UTI
   # PNA, VENT:  Initially attributed to fluid overload in the setting of
   anuria [**3-6**] hepatorenal syndrome. CT Torso then confirmed multi lobar
   PNA.  Has now completed course for HAP.  Currently intubated [**3-6**]
   respiratory failure from fluid overload and PNA.
   -- PEEP at 10 and PS at 5; will taper to PEEP 5, PS 5
   -- Plan for possible extubation tomorrow after dialysis if tolerates

   # HIT: Ab positive. Serotonin release assay ordred.  Appreciate
   continued heme input.
   - if scan today shows +thrombosis will start argatroban
   # Enterococcal UTI: has been on Vancomycin
   -day 1 abx on [**12-8**]. Plan for 14 day course.
   # Altered mental status/ Hepatic Encephalopathy:  Improved

- The patient's mental status has improved significantly on current therapy.
- He has acute renal failure, likely hepatorenal, and is oliguric.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) continue to rise, and imaging studies are needed to assess for clot versus infection.
- The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and requires supplementation with thiamine and folate.
- He experienced an episode of coffee ground emesis last week, but no plan for scope has been made at this time.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He presented with shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, and likely [3-6] EtOH intake. The hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status (AMS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure possibly [3-6] hepatorenal syndrome, and leukocytosis with worsening transaminitis over the weekend.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a concern for aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and respiratory function.

2. Cirrhosis with acute decompensation: The patient has worsening transaminitis, indicating ongoing liver injury. There is a risk of hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and potential bleeding complications.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or drug reaction. In the absence of an identified source, it may indicate a new infection or progression of a current one.

4. Thrombocytopenia/H"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ethanol abuse, and now presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, and likely alcohol intoxication. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status changes (AMS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome, and leukocytosis with worsening transaminitis over the weekend.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he has a history of aspiration, which increases the risk of further respiratory complications.

2. Infection: The patient is at an increased risk of infection due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of leukocytosis. He has already developed infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infection.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of ethanol abuse and the presence of AMS, there is a risk of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient may be experiencing AKI, possibly related to hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury. He is currently undergoing hemodialysis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy, as well as multifocal pneumonia (PNA). The patient self-extubated but is currently doing well. The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is now on a second course of antibiotics due to a new lung infection. The patient has also been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus and has been on vancomycin since then. Additionally, the patient has had an episode of coffee ground emesis, which was evaluated but no plan for scope was made at this time.

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and is currently being treated with multiple antibiotics. There is a concern for lower lobe pneumonia based on the chest X-ray. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation levels is important to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status has improved significantly on current therapy for hepatic encephalopathy. It is essential to continue lactulose and rifaximin as prescribed to prevent the recurrence of hepatic en"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy, as well as multifocal pneumonia.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which is mentioned in the assessment and plan section of the note.

2. Rash: The patient is described as having a rash, but no further information or treatment is mentioned regarding this condition.

3. Hepatitis-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient tested positive for HIT antibodies, and a serotonin release assay was ordered to confirm the diagnosis. The patient is being followed up by the hematology team.

4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient initially had respiratory failure attributed to fluid overload due to anuria and hepatorenal syndrome. A CT torso confirmed multi-lobar pneumonia. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is now on a second course of antibiotics.

5. Gastrointestinal bleed, other (GI bleed, GIB): The patient had an episode of coffee ground emesis last week, but no active plan for scope or further investigation into the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse admitted with acute decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient self-extubated but is doing well on a face tent. He has completed courses for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and is currently on multiple antibiotics. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) remain elevated, and he has been diagnosed with enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI). He also has altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy and is on lactulose and rifamixin. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is being supplemented with thiamine and folate. He is on hemodialysis (HD) for acute renal failure, which is likely hepatorenal in origin. The patient has a positive Ab positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is being monitored closely. He is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis due to potential HIT. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and ongoing management of his various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is a result of hepatic en"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ETOH abuse. He presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation. The hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome, and leukocytosis with worsening transaminitis over the weekend.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing this due to volume overload with aspiration/HAP. He self-extubated on day 3 but is doing well on a face tent. He is currently on Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to continue bronchodilators.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient has acute decompensation likely due to ETOH abuse. Worsening transaminitis of unclear etiology is observed. An abdominal ultrasound (US) was negative for obstruction, portal vein clot, and there is not enough fluid to perform paracentesis. A transjugular liver biopsy is planned today, and if excessive sedation is needed, intubation may be required. Follow-up with hepatology is recommended, along with the continuation of lactulose and rifaxamin. Thiamine/Folate should also be continued.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient is now in sinus rhythm. Lopressor should be continued, and dilt gtt may be considered if he goes back into RVR.

4. Leukocytosis: This could be due to an ongoing infection or a drug reaction (considering the presence of a rash). Two C. difficile tests have been negative. The patient is on Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro to cover enterococcus UTI, VAP, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Cefepime and levo were stopped on 12/16. An abdominal US was negative for hepatic abscess, ascites, and portal vein obstruction. No paracentesis was performed due to insufficient fluid. Follow-up with glucan and cytomegalovirus (CMV) is advised.

5. Acute kidney disease (AKD) with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury (ATI): The patient is on hemodialysis (HD). No HD was performed today. Daily bladder pressure should be monitored. The HD line will be changed by interventional radiology (IR) today, but a tunneled line cannot be placed due to coagulopathy.

6. Thrombocytopenia/HIT+: No anticoagulation is currently administered. HD is done with citrate.

ICU Care:

- Nutrition: The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth).
- Glycemic control measures are in place.
- Lines include a PICC line inserted on 12/7, a dialysis catheter inserted on 12/8, and an arterial line inserted on 12/13.
- Prophylaxis includes DVT prevention with boots and stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
- VAP prophylaxis is also in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and previous aspiration event put him at risk for further respiratory complications.

2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and ongoing infection may lead to worsening sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.

3. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the patient's cirrhosis and AKD, he is at risk for developing hepatorenal syndrome, which can lead to acute kidney injury.

4. Thrombocytopenia/HIT+: The patient's low platelet count and history of recent procedures increase the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Acute decompensation of cirrhosis: The patient's worsening transaminitis and hepatic encephalopathy indicate a deterioration"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, ETOH abuse, presenting with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation. The hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome, and leukocytosis with worsening transaminitis over the weekend.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure due to volume overload with aspiration or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). He self-extubated on day 3 but is doing well on a face tent. Current treatment includes vancomycin, zosyn/cipro for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Cirrhosis: The patient has acute decompensation of cirrhosis, likely exacerbated by alcohol abuse. Worsening transaminitis of unclear etiology is observed, and an abdominal ultrasound (US) was negative for obstruction or portal vein clot. A transjugular liver biopsy is planned today, and follow-up with hepatology is recommended. Lactulose and rifaximin should be continued, along with thiamine/folate supplementation.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR): The patient is"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU. He presents with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, rash, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyponatremia, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and an enterococcal urinary tract infection.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing with vancomycin, Zosyn, and ciprofloxacin antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated infections. Lactulose and rifamixin have been prescribed for hepatic encephalopathy. A transjugular liver biopsy is planned to investigate the cause of transaminitis and elevated bilirubin levels. The patient is also on fluid removal, hemodialysis, and fundaparinux for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis due to suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pulmonary edema, atelectasis or pneumonia, further gastrointestinal bleeding, development of new infections, worsening renal function, hepatic ischemia, and hepatic encephalopathy exacerbation.

It is important to monitor the patient"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia. The patient has received multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem. Other medications administered include pantoprazole (Protonix).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5 C (97.7 F), a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/50 mmHg to 139/133 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a venti mask. The patient's weight has decreased from 175.1 kg at admission to 145.4 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,031 mL including 168 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 751 mL through intravenous fluids, and 168 mL through drains. The total output includes 1,000 mL of urine, 31 mL of drain output, and no output from the gastrointestinal tract.

The patient is on respiratory support with a venti mask and has an ABG analysis pending. Physical examination findings are incomplete due to the patient's unresponsive state.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 47 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, slightly low potassium level of 4.4 mg/dL, normal sodium level of 29 mg/dL, slightly low magnesium level of 2.3 mg/dL, elevated chloride level of 102 mEq/L, elevated bicarbonate level of 29.1%, and elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 22.5 K/uL.

The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation, rash, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, hyponatremia, renal failure, and liver function abnormalities. The patient has been monitored with various lines including a PICC line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line.

The patient's disposition is currently unknown."

   24 Hour Events:
   CXR:  In comparison with the recent prior study, there
   has been interval increase and interstitial opacities in the right
   lung, most
   likely representing worsening of the pulmonary edema. The retrocardiac
   opacity of the left lower lobe and a small left pleural effusion are
   unchanged
   since the prior study, this may represent atelectasis or pneumonia in
   the
   appropriate clinical setting.
   Did not get transjugular biopsy done  due to another emergent case.
   Will be added on for tomorrow.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M (h/o hypertension, COPD, ETOH abuse) p/w SOB, volume overload, new
   diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely [**3-6**] EtOH.
   Hospital course complicated by AMS likely [**3-6**] hepatic encephalopathy,
   coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, acute renal failure possibly [**3-6**] hepatorenal
   syndrome, now with leukocytosis and worsening transaminitis over
   weekend.
   # Cirrhosis: Acute decompensation likely [**3-6**] ETOH abuse.  Worsening
   transaminitis of unclear etiology. Abd US negative for obstruction,
   portal vein clot.  Not enough fluid to do paracentesis.   Plan for
   liver biopsy.
   - Transjugular liver biopsy today, may need intubation for the
   procedure if needs excessive amounts of sedation
   - F/U with hepatology
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - Thiamine/Folate
   # Leukocytosis: Consider on-going infection, drug reaction (in light of
   rash).  Last diff w/elevated Eosinophils.  C diff negative x 2.
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro to cover enterococcus UTI, VAP, and SBP
   - Cefepime, levo stopped [**2124-12-16**]
   - ABD US negative for hepatic abscess, ascites, portal vein

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse. He presented with shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely due to excessive alcohol consumption. During his hospital stay, he experienced altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome, leukocytosis, and worsening transaminitis.

The patient's current conditions include cirrhosis with acute decompensation, worsening transaminitis of unclear etiology, leukocytosis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKD) with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and thrombocytopenia/heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT+).

Plan:
1. Perform transjugular liver biopsy today, may need intubation for the procedure if excessive amounts of sedation are required.
2. Follow up with hepatology.
3. Continue lactulose and rifaximin.
4. Administer thiamine and folate.
5. Consider ongoing infection or drug reaction causing leukocytosis. Cover for enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ETOH abuse, admitted to the ICU for symptoms of SOB, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, and likely EtOH abuse. The hospital course has been complicated by AMS likely hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome, and now leukocytosis with worsening transaminitis over the weekend.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cirrhosis: Acute decompensation likely due to ETOH abuse. Worsening transaminitis of unclear etiology. The patient may develop further complications related to cirrhosis, such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, or esophageal varices.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or drug reaction. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload with aspiration/HAP. There is a risk of worsening respiratory status, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and potential need for reintubation.
4. AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or require long-term dialysis"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ethanol abuse, and cirrhosis presenting with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, and new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status changes (AMS) likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome, and leukocytosis with worsening transaminitis over the weekend.

The patient currently has hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to volume overload with aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He is self-extubated on day 3 but is doing well on a face tent. He is being treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient also has cirrhosis with acute decompensation likely secondary to ethanol abuse. There is worsening transaminitis of unclear etiology. An abdominal ultrasound (US) was negative for obstruction or portal vein clot. A transjugular liver biopsy is planned for today, which may require intubation if excessive amounts of sedation are needed. The patient will be followed up with hepatology, and lactulose and rifaximin will be continued. Thiamine and folate will also be administered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for acute decompensation of alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient had a multifocal pneumonia and was reintubated after an acute decompensation. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including hypotension, pneumonia, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyponatremia, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension during the initiation of hemodialysis prior to significant fluid removal. It occurred acutely and may be related to an underlying infectious process given the worsening leukocytosis.

2. Pneumonia/Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient had self-extubated and was doing well until an acute decompensation. The chest X-ray showed perihilar pulmonary vascular congestion, which is likely due to increased lung volumes and positive pressure effect on edema. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be related to the underlying pneumonia"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated for hypoxia and hypotension. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Pulmonary edema: The CXR shows increased pulmonary edema, indicating fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Right-sided effusion: The presence of a right-sided effusion suggests an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the chest cavity.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection or inflammation.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can be caused by various factors including bleeding, medications, or bone marrow suppression.
5. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are significantly elevated, suggesting possible liver damage or dysfunction.
6. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hypokalemia (low potassium), hyponatremia (low sodium), and hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate), which may be related to kidney dysfunction or fluid management.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP and FiO2, indicating severe respiratory distress.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be related to stress ulcers or other causes.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and alcohol abuse, presenting with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis, and acute decompensation. The patient has had several complications during his hospital stay, including acute mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome. The patient self-extubated but then experienced another acute decompensation with hypoxia and hypotension, necessitating emergent reintubation and the use of pressors.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to atelectasis and volume overload superimposed on aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been reintubated and is now improved with increased PEEP.
- Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Perform bronchoscopic secretion clearance daily.
- Initiate hemodialysis per renal failure.
- Administer bronchodilators.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely from sepsis secondary to an abdominal source, given increased abdominal pain, elevated lactate levels, increased lipase, and worsening leukocytosis. A pulmonary source should also be considered.
- Perform bronchoscopy"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation. The hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status change likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing this due to atelectasis and volume overload superimposed on aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He has been reintubated and is now improved with increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to sepsis from an abdominal source, given the increased abdominal pain, elevated lactate levels, increased lipase, and worsening leukocytosis. A pulmonary source must also be considered.
- Cirrhosis: The patient has acute decompensation likely due to ethanol abuse. There is worsening transaminitis of unclear etiology. An abdominal ultrasound (US) was negative for obstruction or portal vein clot. There is not enough fluid to perform a paracentesis, and a plan for a liver biopsy has been made.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of altered mental status, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, liver function abnormalities, renal failure, and leukocytosis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is evidence of right lower extremity edema and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and hypomagnesemia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and lactate levels. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the use of anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, suggesting an infection, and the presence of an indwelling catheter increases the risk of bloodstream infections.
4. Renal Complications: The patient has acute renal failure, and ongoing renal replacement therapy may be required to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hepatic Complications: The patient has liver function abnormalities, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy and coagul"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acute decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. He also had multifocal pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension during the initiation of hemodialysis prior to significant fluid removal. It is likely due to an underlying infectious process given the worsening leukocytosis.
2. Pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory failure: The patient self-extubated but then developed acute decompensation. The chest X-ray showed perihilar pulmonary vascular congestion, which improved with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) likely due to increased lung volumes and positive pressure effect on edema.
3. Leukocytosis: The source of leukocytosis is unclear at this time, with all cultures being negative except for the initial urine culture. The patient is completing a course of antibiotics.
4. Transminitis and elevated bilirubin: Liver function tests remain elevated, and the cause is unclear. A transjugular liver biopsy is planned today.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has hepatorenal syndrome, which is oliguric and now on hemodialysis. An inferior vena cava (IV"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse admitted for acute decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently intubated due to acute respiratory failure. There is also evidence of perihilar pulmonary vascular congestion on the chest X-ray, indicating possible pulmonary edema.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with negative cultures except for an initial urine culture. This suggests a possible ongoing infection, and the patient has already completed courses of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) with transaminitis, elevated bilirubin levels, and synthetic dysfunction. This may be due to alcoholic liver disease or other underlying liver pathology.
4. Renal failure: The patient is oliguric and has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. He is currently on hemodialysis (HD).
5. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M (h/o hypertension, COPD, ETOH abuse) p/w SOB, volume overload, new
   diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely [**3-6**] EtOH.
   Hospital course complicated by AMS likely [**3-6**] hepatic encephalopathy,
   coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly [**3-6**] hepatorenal
   syndrome. Self extubated and doing well [**12-18**], then with acute
   decompensation [**12-20**] with hypoxia and hypotension requiring emergent
   reintubation and pressors.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely due to atelectasis and volume
   overload superimposed on aspiration / HAP.  S/p bronch [**12-21**] for
   secretion clearance.
   - On Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for VAP
 Day [**6-9**]
   - HD per renal
   - Bronchodilators
    -Check CXR today
   - Change to PS [**6-16**] today as overbreathing vent off sedation
   (comfortable)
   # Hypotension: Likely from sepis [**3-6**] abdominal source given increased
   abd pain yesterday, increased LFTs/bili, lactate, increased lipase,
   worsening leukocytosis. Also must consider pulmonary source. Pan CT
   unrevealing.
   - F/U pan cultures
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro to cover enterococcus UTI, VAP, and SBP
   - D/c flagyl as c.diff negative

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to atelectasis and volume overload superimposed on aspiration/pneumonia. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin for ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient also has hypotension, likely from sepsis secondary to an abdominal source, as well as worsening liver function tests, elevated lactate levels, and increased lipase. A CT scan of the abdomen was unrevealing.

Additionally, the patient has cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely exacerbated by alcohol abuse. There is worsening transaminitis with elevated bilirubin of unclear etiology. An abdominal ultrasound was negative for obstruction or portal vein clot, and a CT scan was also unrevealing. The patient underwent a liver biopsy and is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic enceph"

The hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing this due to atelectasis and volume overload superimposed on aspiration / Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). He was reintubated yesterday and is now improved with increased PEEP. Treatment includes Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bronch for secretion clearance, high-flow oxygen, and close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely from sepsis originating from an abdominal source, given increased abdominal pain yesterday, increased lactate levels, increased lipase levels, worsening leukocytosis. Other potential causes include a pulmonary source. Treatment includes bronchoscopic evaluation of airways and sending sputum culture, considering an abdominal CT with PO/IV contrast (dependent on renal function), following up with pan cultures, and continuing Vanc/Z"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M (h/o hypertension, COPD, ETOH abuse) p/w SOB, volume overload, new
   diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely [**3-6**] EtOH.
   Hospital course complicated by AMS likely [**3-6**] hepatic encephalopathy,
   coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly [**3-6**] hepatorenal
   syndrome. Self extubated and doing well [**12-18**], then with acute
   decompensation [**12-20**] with hypoxia and hypotension requiring emergent
   reintubation and pressors.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely due to atelectasis and volume
   overload superimposed on aspiration / HAP.  S/p bronch [**12-21**] for
   secretion clearance.

   # Hypotension: Likely from sepis [**3-6**] abdominal source given increased
   abd pain yesterday, increased LFTs/bili, lactate, increased lipase,
   worsening leukocytosis. Also must consider pulmonary source. Pan CT
   unrevealing.
   - F/U pan cultures
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro to cover enterococcus UTI, VAP, and SBP
   - D/c flagyl as c.diff negative
   - ID consult
   # Cirrhosis: Acute decompensation likely [**3-6**] ETOH abuse.  Worsening
   transaminitis with elevated bili of unclear etiology. Abd US negative
   for obstruction, portal vein clot.  CT unrevealing. Not enough fluid to
   do paracentesis.   S/p liver biopsy.
   - F/U liver biopsy path
   - F/U with hepatology
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - Thiamine/Folate
   #AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI: On HD.   S/p renal line
   resited.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. The patient presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, and likely alcohol-induced liver disease. 

The patient's hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status (AMS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome. 

The patient self-extubated but then experienced acute decompensation with hypoxia and hypotension, necessitating emergent reintubation and the use of pressors. 

The patient is currently being treated for hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely caused by atelectasis and volume overload on top of aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has undergone bronchoscopy for secretion clearance.

The patient is also being treated for hypotension, which is likely due to sepsis from an abdominal source, given the increased abdominal pain, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), bilirubin, lactate, and lipase levels. Other potential causes of hypotension, such as a pulmonary source, should also be considered. Pancreatic computed tomography (CT) was unrevealing.

The patient's cirrhosis has led to an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU. He presented with acute decompensation of alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient also has multifocal pneumonia. He was reintubated due to an acute decompensation on 12/20. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including transminitis, pulmonary vascul congestion, hypotension, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, HIT, enterococcal UTI, altered mental status, ETOH history, coffee ground emesis, and fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Transminitis: Elevated liver enzymes indicate liver injury or dysfunction.
2. Pulmonary vascular congestion: The presence of perihilar pulmonary vasuclar congestion suggests possible heart failure or fluid overload.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension during the initiation of hemodialysis (HD) and may be related to underlying infectious processes or liver failure.
4. Leukocytosis: Unclear source of leukocytosis; all cultures have been negative except for an initial urine culture.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has hepatorenal syndrome, which is kidney failure secondary to liver disease.
6. Atrial fibrillation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient also had multifocal pneumonia and was reintubated due to acute decompensation on [12-20].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension during the initiation of hemodialysis prior to significant fluid removal. It occurred acutely and could be related to an underlying infectious process given worsening leukocytosis.

2. Pneumonia (PNA), Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient self-extubated but developed acute decompensation on [12-21]. A chest X-ray showed perihilar pulmonary vascular congestion, which improved with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) likely due to increased lung volumes and positive pressure effect on edema. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Leukocytosis: The source of leukocytosis is unclear at this time, with all cultures being negative except for an initial positive urine culture. The patient is completing a course of antibiotics, and further investigations such as fungal cultures and c"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status, and they have a history of liver biopsy showing stage 4 fibrosis or cirrhosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatitis C viral load: The patient's hepatitis C viral load should be monitored closely, as it can contribute to liver damage and progression of cirrhosis.

2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has very high coagulation levels, which raises concern for DIC. This condition involves abnormal blood clotting throughout the body, leading to bleeding and organ damage. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management are necessary.

3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal failure. It is important to assess kidney function regularly and provide appropriate treatment to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hepatitis B viral load: Similar to hepatitis C, the patient's hepatitis B viral load should be monitored due to its association with liver disease and potential transmission.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a high plateau pressure, indicating a risk for ventilator-induced lung injury. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjusting ventilator settings accordingly are crucial.

6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding should be evaluated and managed promptly to prevent complications such as hypotension and shock.

7. Hypotension: The patient's"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ETOH abuse presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely secondary to alcohol abuse. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome. The patient self-extubated and did well initially but then experienced an acute decompensation with hypoxia and hypotension requiring emergent reintubation and pressors.

The patient is presumed to have septic shock likely from a septic abdominal source given increased abdominal pain yesterday, increased liver function tests/bilirubin, lactate, and lipase levels, as well as worsening leukocytosis. Other potential sources of infection include pneumonia. The abdominal CT scan was unrevealing.

The plan includes maintaining a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60, weaning Levophed as tolerated, following up with pan cultures and bronchoscopies, continuing Zosyn/Cipro to cover enterococcus urinary tract infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, discontinuing flagyl as Clostridium difficile is negative, and consulting with the infectious disease service.

The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure is likely due to atelectasis and volume overload"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely secondary to alcohol abuse. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status (AMS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome. The patient self-extubated but subsequently experienced acute decompensation with hypoxia and hypotension, necessitating emergent reintubation and pressors.

The patient is presumed to have septic shock likely from a septic abdominal source, given increased abdominal pain, elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels, lactate levels, and lipase levels, as well as worsening leukocytosis. There is also a concern for a pulmonary source. Pan computed tomography (CT) was unrevealing.

The patient's current goals include achieving a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60, weaning Levophed as tolerated, following up with pan cultures and bronch studies, continuing Zosyn/Cipro to cover enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), discontinuing flagyl as Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) is negative, and consulting with the infectious disease (ID) service.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to atelectasis and volume overload superimposed on aspiration/HAP. Bronchoscopic therapy was performed for secretion clearance, and the patient is on Zosyn/Cipro for VAP. The patient is also undergoing continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) for fluid removal, bronchodilators, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) trials as tolerated.

Cirrhosis is believed to be an initial decompensation likely secondary to alcohol abuse. Worsening transaminitis with elevated bilirubin levels of unclear etiology was noted, with an abdominal ultrasound (US) negative for obstruction or portal vein clot. CT imaging was unrevealing, and liver biopsy revealed stage IV cirrhosis and some necrosis. Repeat LFTs are being performed to ensure accuracy of values, and consultation with the hepatology service is needed for management. Supportive hemodynamics and continued workup are necessary, and clarification of the patient's HIV status is required. Hepatitis serologies are negative, but hepatitis E, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and an unspecified last name are pending.

The patient's obtundation is off propofol, and lactulose and rifaximin are being continued. Thiamine and folate supplementation are also being administered. Acute kidney injury (AKI) with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular injury (ATI) is present, and the patient is on hemodialysis (HD). The renal line has been resited, and the patient is undergoing continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) per renal consultation.

Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/VR) has resolved spontaneously, and lopressor is being held while on pressors. Thrombocytopenia/Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is suspected, but the serotonin assay is negative, allowing the use of heparin for anticoagulation.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving fiber source enteral nutrition, and glycemic control is well-managed. The patient has multiple lines, including a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter. Prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer, and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. Restraints are being reviewed, and communication with the patient's parents is ongoing.

The patient's code status remains full code, and the patient is to remain in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. He has been reintubated due to an acute decompensation. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including hypotension, sepsis, altered mental status, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, atrial fibrillation, hepatic encephalopathy, and a history of alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's recent episodes of hypotension and signs of infection suggest possible sepsis. Cultures have been negative except for the initial urine culture.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and a liver biopsy confirms cirrhosis. The cause of liver failure is unclear.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Renal Failure: The patient is oliguric and has been placed on hemodialysis for hepatorenal syndrome.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Tachycardia may have contributed to myocardial ischemia.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy, as well as multiple pneumonia. He is reintubated due to an acute decompensation on [12-20]. 

The patient has several medical complications, including sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, rash, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, altered mental status (not delirium), hypertension, respiratory failure (acute), gastrointestinal bleed (other), hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality), renal failure (acute), liver function abnormalities, and a history of ethanol abuse. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and liver enzymes, as well as low platelet count, creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's blood cultures have been negative except for an initial urine culture for which he is completing a course of antibiotics. 

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing lactulose and rifamixin for hepatic encephalopathy, following hepatology recommendations, and finalizing liver biopsy results. He is also being mechanically ventilated with serial ABG adjustments, receiving Vancomycin, Zosyn, and C"

   was started yesterday given recent Cosyntropin test that did not show
   an appropriate increase s/p cosyntropin.   Vanco and Flagyl were
   restarted as these antibiotics were d/c

   - cont hydrocort
   - hold IVF for now as CVP now 14-15 (5 yesterday)
   # ?Sepsis: Unclear source at this time; all cultures have been negative
   except initial urine for which he is completing a course.   Most likely

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy, along with multiple positive blood cultures.

The patient's recent events include hypotension episodes, suspected sepsis, liver failure, altered mental status, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and a positive result for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including IV fluids, Levophed, hydrocortisone, antibiotics, vasopressin, and tube feeds. The plan includes weaning off Levophed, continuing antibiotics, monitoring renal function, restarting CVVH, and adjusting medications accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, organ dysfunction, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, and complications related to HIT.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further assessment and evaluation by a healthcare professional is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and management of the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient also has multifocal pneumonia.

The patient experienced episodes of hypotension yesterday that were thought to be sepsis. He was given 4 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) and his vasopressor, Levophed, was increased. Hydrocortisone was started due to a recent Cosyntropin test that did not show an appropriate increase. The antibiotics Vancomycin and Flagyl were restarted as they had been previously discontinued.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, assist-control ventilation (ACV), and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 15 cmH2O. His oxygenation is maintained with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch, 146.7 kg male in the ICU with a chief complaint of arterial line stoppage. The patient has been experiencing increasing hypotension and required increases in Levophed. Lactate levels were found to be elevated at 5.9, and liver function tests continue to rise. The patient received 4 liters of IV fluids overnight and 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient has allergies to heparin agents, thrombocytopenia, and an allergy to cefepime. The last dose of antibiotics given was Ciprofloxacin on 12/23/2124 at 10:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine at 0.25 mcg/kg/min and diltiazem at 10 mg/hour.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/35 mmHg to 139/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and atrial fibrillation as the heart rhythm.

The patient's weight has decreased from 175.1 kg at admission to 146.7 kg currently. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg, total intake is 7,593 mL with 5,369 mL being IV fluids, total output is 6,588 mL with 2,109 mL being urine output, and the fluid balance is positive at 1,005 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 650 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 15 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 29 cmH2O, and plateau pressure at 27 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 218. The respiratory support device used is an endotracheal tube, and the mode is controlled mechanical ventilation with assist.

Physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, not assessed skin, and not assessed neurologic examination. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.8 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 7.7 mmol/L, liver function abnormalities with elevated liver enzymes, acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and alcohol abuse. He presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, and new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely related to alcohol use. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome. The patient self-extubated but subsequently experienced acute decompensation with hypoxia and hypotension, necessitating emergent reintubation and the use of pressors.

The patient has had a marked increase in AST and ALT levels, as well as increased pressor requirements and lactate, indicating presumed septic shock likely from a septic abdominal source. Other contributing factors include relative adrenal insufficiency and metabolic acidemia. The patient's condition has also been complicated by thrombocytopenia, AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI, and obtundation.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including stress-dose steroids, Zosyn/Cipro for enterococcus UTI, VAP, and SBP, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is currently critically ill."

   marked transaminitis since [**12-23**].
   Presumed septic shock: Likely from sepis [**3-6**] abdominal source given
   increased abd pain yesterday, increased LFTs/bili, lactate. Also must
   consider pulmonary source. Pan CT unrevealing.  Other contributing
   factors include relative adrenal insuff and metabolic acidemia
   - goal MAP 55-60, wean Levophed as tolerated. Would hold off on further
   fluid resuscitation
   - CVVH to resume today for correction of acid-base disturbance
   - Continue Zosyn/Cipro to cover enterococcus UTI, VAP, and SBP; cont
   metronidazole and vancomycin added back yesterday
   - F/U pan cultures, bronch studies; f/u fungal cx and consider
   micafungin
   - touch base w/ ID service
   - cont stress-dose steroids
   Decompensated liver disease: : Initial decompensation likely [**3-6**] ETOH
   abuse.  Worsening transaminitis with elevated bili of unclear etiology.
   Abd US negative for obstruction, portal vein clot.  CT unrevealing. Not
   enough fluid to do paracentesis.   S/p liver biopsy.  Markedly
   increased transaminases in the last 24h
   -need to touch base w/ hepatology svce re: mgmt. At this point support
   hemodynamics and cont workup
   -clarfiy HIV status; Hep serologies negative but will add on hep E,
   HSV, EBV and [**Last Name (un) 4195**]
   -Continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   -add standing vit K
   -Thiamine/Folate
   Afib w/ RVR: likely driven by norepi gtt and septic shock picture
   -titrate off diltiazem gtt and reduce norepi gtt or switch if still
   with afib/rvr despite
   Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely due to atelectasis and volume
   overload superimposed on aspiration / HAP.  S/p bronch [**12-21**] for
   secretion clearance.
   -On Zosyn/Cipro for VAP
 Day [**8-9**]; broadened as above yestrerd
   -Bronchodilators
   -further vent weaning currently limited by septic shock and poor mental
   status
   Obtundation: off propofol and still poorly responsive
   -continue to hold sedation and monitor, expected delayed recovery
   -cont lactulose and rifaximin
   -cont thiamine and folate
   AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI: On HD.   S/p renal line
   resited.
   - On CVVHD per Renal
   Thrombocytopenia/HIT+:  Serotonin assay negative

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol abuse, and cirrhosis presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, and acute decompensation. He was admitted to the ICU and experienced multiple complications including acute mental status change likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome, self-extubation, hypoxia, hypotension, and emergent reintubation with pressors.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with a recent increase in arterial blood gases showing acidosis. He has been on maximal medical therapy, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal support. His vital signs are currently stable, but he remains critically ill.

Assessment and plan:
1. Decompensated liver disease: The patient likely has alcoholic liver disease leading to acute decompensation. Further workup is needed to determine the cause of elevated bilirubin levels. A liver biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to atelectasis and volume overload. Bronchodilators and secretion clearance measures should be continued.
3. AKD with possible hepatorenal syndrome or ATI: The patient is on hemodialysis and should continue to be monitored closely.
4. Obtundation: The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ETOH abuse presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely related to alcohol abuse. The hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome. The patient self-extubated and then experienced another episode of acute decompensation with hypoxia and hypotension, necessitating emergent reintubation and pressors. There has also been a marked increase in AST and ALT as well as increased pressor requirement and lactate, indicating presumed septic shock, possibly from a septic abdominal source or pulmonary source. Other contributing factors include relative adrenal insufficiency and metabolic acidemia.

The patient's current goals include maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55-60, weaning Levophed as tolerated, holding off on further fluid resuscitation, resuming continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for correction of acid-base disturbance, continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, monitoring for fungal infection and considering micafungin, touching base with the infectious disease service, continuing stress-dose steroids, decompressed liver disease management, clarifying HIV status, and managing hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The patient has a complex medical history, including de"

   and hepatic encephalopathy, multifocal PNA. Now reintubated s/p acute
   decompensation on [**12-20**]
   # Hypotension: Currently maxed on levophed with vassopressin. Would add
   Neo next.  Etiology is unclear. Acute onset during HD session a few
   days ago would suggest a more vascular/mechanical process.  Most liekly
   related to his worsening decompensated cirrhosis. Being treated
   empirically for sepsis
   - would add neo next, do not anticipate being able to wean pressors
   - cont hydrocort
   - hold IVF for now as CVP high
   # ?Sepsis: Unclear source at this time; all cultures have been negative
   except initial urine for which he is completing a course.   Most likely
   cause at this time is hepatic cirrhosis and liver failure.  Per
   hepatology, no clear cause of liver failure at this time, biopsy w/
   cirrhosis.

   acutely decompensated.  Unclear cause at this time.  RUQ U/S done
   showed no signs of obstruction & patent Portal/hepatic Veins twice
   -- cont lactulose, rifamixin
   -- f/u hepatology recs: consider discussing role for empiric tx w/
   pentoxyphylline for alc hep
   # Coagulopathy: possibly some element of DIC superimposed on synthtic
   dysfunction given acute rise in INR to20
   -- continue vitamin K

   congestion which is improved w/ peep likely [**3-6**] to increased lung
   volumes and positive pressure effect on edema. Patient has now
   completed course for HAPx1 & is d8/8 for VAP, but contuing abx as
   above.
   - Continue mechnical ventilation, serial ABG w/ vent adjustments

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been reintubated after experiencing an acute decompensation.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently maxed on levophed with vasopressin. There is a possibility of adding neo next. Etiology is unclear, but it could be related to worsening decompensated cirrhosis. Being treated empirically for sepsis.
2. Sepsis: Unclear source at this time. All cultures have been negative except for the initial urine, for which he is completing a course. Most likely cause is hepatic cirrhosis and liver failure.
3. Transminitis/ Elevated bilirubin/Synthetic dysfunction: LFTs climbing; acutely decompensated. Unclear cause at this time. RUQ U/S showed no signs of obstruction & patent Portal/hepatic Veins twice.
4. Coagulopathy: Possible element of DIC superimposed on synthetic dysfunction given acute rise in INR to 20.
5. PNA/Vent/Hypoxic respiratory failure: Self-extubated & doing well until acute decompensation. CXR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. He has a history of impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, rash, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, hypertension, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, hyponatremia, renal failure, and liver function abnormalities.

24-hour events include the start of an arterial line, which did not respond to neos and had to be managed with levophed and vasopressin. The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation, controlled with diltiazem drip. Antibiotics were administered, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, and calcium gluconate during CRRT.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), blood pressure ranging from 110/53 to 92/30 mmHg, heart rate between 93 and 126 bpm, respiratory rate between 15 and 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's weight has decreased from 175.1 kg at admission to 146.7 kg currently.

The patient is receiving several medications and infusions, including vasopressin, calcium gluconate (CRRT), diltiazem, potassium chloride ("

   decompensation on [**12-20**]
   # Hypotension: Episodes of hypotension yesterday thought to be [**3-6**]
   sepsis.  Patient was given 4L IVF, Levophed was uptitrated.   Hydrocort
   was started yesterday given recent Cosyntropin test that did not show
   an appropriate increase s/p cosyntropin.   Vanco and Flagyl were
   restarted as these antibiotics were d/c
ed the day prior and patient
   now with signs of sepsis off of these antibiotics.
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - f/u cultures
   - cont hydrocort
   - hold IVF for now as CVP now 14-15 (5 yesterday)
   # ?Sepsis: Unclear source at this time; all cultures have been negative
   except initial urine for which he is completing a course.   Most likely
   cause at this time is hepatic cirrhosis and liver failure.  Per
   hepatology, no clear cause of liver failure at this time.

   peaked.  Unclear cause at this time.  RUQ U/S done yesterday showed no
   signs of obstruction, Portal Veins seem to be patent.    CT Abd showed
   no abnormalitly except cirrhosis.  Liver biopsy also showing cirrhosis,
   unclear cause.

   # PNA?, VENT, hypoxic resp failure:  self extubated & doing well until
   acute decompensation [**12-21**]. CXR shows perihilar pulmonary vasuclar
   congestion which is improved w/ peep likely [**3-6**] to increased lung
   volumes and positive pressure effect on edema. Patient has now
   completed course for HAPx1 & is d7/8 for VAP .
   - Continue mechnical ventilation, serial ABG w/ vent adjustments

   Afib likely [**3-6**] sepsis/hypotenstion.  Levophed also contributing.  Plan
   is to wean levophed and start vasopressin.  Will titrate dilt off given
   hypotension.
   -- holding metoprolol while on pressors

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments, including reintubation, administration of antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, and dialysis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has had multiple episodes of hypotension and signs of sepsis, despite receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. The source of infection remains unclear.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has developed pressure ulcers, likely due to prolonged immobility.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is being managed with diltiazem.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is currently being managed with antihypertensive medications.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had an episode of coffee ground emesis, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol abuse, presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by acute mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome. The patient self-extubated and did well initially but then had an acute decompensation with hypoxia and hypotension requiring emergent reintubation and pressors. There has been further worsening of pressor requirement and multi-organ system failure since December 23rd.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Presumed septic shock: Likely from sepsis [3-6] abdominal source given increased abdominal pain yesterday, increased liver function tests (LFTs)/bilirubin, lactate. Also must consider pulmonary source. Pan computed tomography (CT) unrevealing. Other contributing factors include relative adrenal insufficiency and metabolic acidemia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, ETOH abuse, presenting with shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely ethanol-induced. The hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome. The patient self-extubated but then experienced acute decompensation with hypoxia and hypotension requiring emergent reintubation and pressors. There has been further worsening of pressor requirement and multi-organ system failure since December 23rd.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Presumed septic shock: The patient may be at risk for septic shock due to suspected infection from an abdominal or pulmonary source. This can lead to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the patient's cirrhosis and acute renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome should be considered as a potential complication. It is a type of kidney failure that occurs in advanced liver disease.
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's condition may progress to DIC, which is a serious complication characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. It can lead to organ damage and increased risk of bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and ETOH abuse. He presents with shortness of breath, volume overload, new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, and likely alcohol intoxication. The hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly hepatorenal syndrome. The patient self-extubated but then experienced acute decompensation with hypoxia and hypotension requiring emergent reintubation and pressors. There is a presumed septic shock likely from a septic abdominal source or pulmonary source. Other contributing factors include relative adrenal insufficiency and metabolic acidemia. 

The patient's current condition includes decompensated liver disease with worsening transaminitis and elevated bilirubin of unclear etiology. An abdominal ultrasound was negative for obstruction or portal vein clot, and a CT scan was unrevealing. The patient underwent a liver biopsy, which showed markedly increased transaminases in the last 24 hours. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to atelectasis and volume overload superimposed on aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia, obtundation off propofol and still poorly responsive, acute kidney dysfunction with possible hepatorenal syndrome or acute tub"

   61 yo M with HTN, COPD, and Hx of ETOH abuse admitted with acutely
   decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia,
   and hepatic encephalopathy, multifocal PNA. Now reintubated s/p acute
   decompensation on [**12-20**]
   # Hypotension: Currently maxed on levophed with vassopressin. Would add
   Neo next.  Etiology is unclear. Acute onset during HD session a few
   days ago would suggest a more vascular/mechanical process.  Most liekly
   related to his worsening decompensated cirrhosis. Being treated
   empirically for sepsis
   - would add neo next, do not anticipate being able to wean pressors
   - cont hydrocort
   - hold IVF for now as CVP high
   # ?Sepsis: Unclear source at this time; all cultures have been negative
   except initial urine for which he is completing a course.   Most likely
   cause at this time is hepatic cirrhosis and liver failure.  Per
   hepatology, no clear cause of liver failure at this time, biopsy w/
   cirrhosis.
   -- cont Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro/flagyl (D8/8); given continued
   decompensation, no plan to stop ABX
   --Glucan, galactomannam negative, fungal cxs pending.
   --Cdiff ruled out repeatedly
   --CMV Viral load negative
   --Abd CT with some mild pancreatic inflammation
   --f/u ID consult: in general, they think that they have little to offer
   at this point
   # Transminitis/ elevated bili/ synthetic dysfunction: LFTs climbing;
   acutely decompensated.  Unclear cause at this time.  RUQ U/S done
   showed no signs of obstruction & patent Portal/hepatic Veins twice
   -- cont lactulose, rifamixin
   -- f/u hepatology recs: consider discussing role for empiric tx w/
   pentoxyphylline for alc hep
   # Coagulopathy: possibly some element of DIC superimposed on synthtic
   dysfunction given acute rise in INR to20
   -- continue vitamin K
   -- q4-6 h DIC labs and Hcts
   # PNA?, VENT, hypoxic resp failure:  self extubated & doing well until
   acute decompensation [**12-21**]. CXR shows perihilar pulmonary vasuclar
   congestion which is improved w/ peep likely [**3-6**] to increased lung
   volumes and positive pressure effect on edema. Patient has now
   completed course for HAPx1 & is d8/8 for VAP, but contuing abx as
   above.
   - Continue mechnical ventilation, serial ABG w/ vent adjustments
   -- cont Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro/flagyl
   -- no plan for vent setting changes given tenous status and possible
   change in goals of care
   # Acute renal failure: likely hepatorenal, oliguric, on CVVH but
   requiring positive fluid balance to maintian BP
   --Monitor renal fxn
   --renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins, no IV contrast
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  +afib with RVR overnight, restarted on Dilt
   gtt.  Afib likely [**3-6**] sepsis/hypotenstion.  Levophed may also
   contributing.  Efforts to transition to neo over levophed have
   -- holding metoprolol while on pressors
   -- wean Dilt gtt
   -- wean levophed, start vasopressin vs Neo if needed
   -- hold anticoagulation for now given coagulopathy
   # HIT: Ab positive. Serotonin release NEGATIVE.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. He has been reintubated due to acute decompensation and is currently on maximum support with vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is being treated empirically for sepsis, but the source of infection is unclear. All cultures have been negative except for an initial positive urine culture.
2. Impaired skin integrity: There is no information provided about any skin lesions or ulcers.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory response.
4. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has AFIB with rapid ventricular response and is being treated with diltiazem.
5. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's platelet count is low, and they have tested positive for HIT antibodies. However, serotonin release assay is negative.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure.
7. Gastrointestinal bleed: There is no information provided about any active gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient also had multiple pulmonary-renal syndromes (PNAs). He required reintubation after an acute decompensation on December 20th. 

The patient's current condition is critical, requiring maximum doses of multiple pressors (Levophed, Neo, Vasopressin). Epinephrine was added this morning due to the family's presence. After a family meeting, the father agreed to make an organ donation decision. Morphine was started, and the pressors were discontinued. Unfortunately, the patient passed away at 2:25 pm. An autopsy was deferred by the family. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, some potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Alcoholic cirrhosis: This can lead to liver dysfunction and complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and portal hypertension.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to respiratory distress or infection.
3. Infection: Given the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as pneumonia"

   Hospital course complicated by AMS likely [**3-6**] hepatic encephalopathy,
   coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly [**3-6**] hepatorenal
   syndrome. Self extubated and doing well [**12-18**], then with acute
   decompensation [**12-20**] with hypoxia and hypotension requiring emergent
   reintubation and pressors. Further worsening of pressor requirement and
   multi-organ system failure since [**12-23**].  Now awaiting family arrival.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and alcohol abuse. He presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, volume overload, and a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely due to excessive alcohol consumption. The hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status (AMS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, coffee-ground emesis with possible aspiration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute renal failure possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome. The patient self-extubated and was doing well, but then experienced an acute decompensation with hypoxia and hypotension requiring emergent reintubation and pressors. There has been further worsening of pressor requirement and multi-organ system failure since then. The patient is now awaiting family arrival.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Presumed septic shock: The patient may be experiencing septic shock due to a suspected abdominal source or possibly a pulmonary source. Increased abdominal pain, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and lactate levels suggest an abdominal source, while the presence of respiratory failure and hypoxemia may indicate a pulmonary source.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient may have DIC secondary to sepsis. DIC is a condition characterized by systemic activation of blood coagulation, which results in the generation and deposition of fibrin, leading to microvascular thrombi in various"
