","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and diverticulitis. The patient underwent surgery and is now on oral medications for pain management. Neurological assessment suggests that she does not require steroids and is not a great candidate for plasmapheresis. IVIG may be considered if unable to extubate. The patient received bolused IVFs and was started on Vanc and Zosyn due to a negative Gram stain. The patient's CT scan showed sigmoid diverticulitis with adjacent punctate foci of air compatible with focal perforation, mildly worsened in appearance from the prior study. No drainable fluid collection was observed. Additionally, there is new left lower lobe collapse secondary to mucus plugging/aspiration. The CT scan was nondiagnostic for evaluation of pulmonary embolism, showing no central thrombus. In case of continued clinical concern for pulmonary embolism, a repeat study can be obtained. The patient's fever is present, and she is sedated and unable to provide a history. Allergies include Prempro, Fiorinal, Erythromycin Base, and Aleve. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Metronidazole, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). Infusions include Propofol and Famotidine (Pepcid). Heparin sodium (prophyl"

   Nasogastric tube again extends well into the stomach. Extensive
   opacification
   is seen at the left base consistent with volume loss and pleural
   effusion.
   There is apparent opacification in the left perihilar region. This
   could
   represent an area of developing aspiration or volume loss related to
   mucus
   plugging.
   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old woman with hisotry of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] who presents with
   progressive abdominal pain and respiratory failure likely 2/2 MG flare
   vs PE.
   .
   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myesthenic crisis.
   No evidence of pneumonia on bronch.  No leukocytosis, T to 101.2
   yesterday at 1600, but concomitant diverticulitis makes inflammatory
   markers less useful.  Unable to move to PSV yesterday.  Per neuro, this
   is less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], but recommended following NIFs and
   initiating IVIG if evidence of new weakness.  Also could be an element
   of splinting from abdominal pain.
   - Stop vancomycin
   - f/u Sputum culture
   - propofol for sedation
   - wean vent as tolerated, continue daily SBTs
   - follow NIFs/VCs/TVs while on vent (wean when VC>15, NIF<-30)
   - neuro recs
   .
   ## Diverticulitis: Diagnosed as o/p and confirmed by abdominal imaging
   here with focal perf no drainable fluid collection and no free air.
   Per surgery can restart PO.
   - continue zosyn
   - IVF PRN to keep UOP >30cc/hr
   - f/u surgery recs
   - start tube feeds, PO meds
   .
   ## HypoK: Had hypokalemia on last admission and in ED. Repleted in ED.
   - follow lytes
   - replete Prn
   - rechec K now
   .
   ## MG: As above may be in flare from diverticulitis. On pyridostigmine
   at home.
   - restart mestanone (pyridostigmine)
   - Checking NIFs/VC's Q6H
   - Avoid aminoglycosides as can precipitate MG
   - Avoid MG exacerbating meds prior
   - follow up neuro recs
   ,
   ## HTN: Has h/o HTN. Currently not hypertensive and propofol will drop
   bps so will hold meds for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis who presented with progressive abdominal pain and respiratory failure. She was initially suspected to have pneumonia or a myasthenic crisis, but no evidence of pneumonia was found on bronchoscopic examination. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors including MG flare, diverticulitis, and aspiration. She underwent surgery for diverticulitis and is now on tube feeds and oral medications. The patient's other medical conditions include hypertension, for which she is currently not hypertensive, and hypokalemia, which has been repleted. She is currently receiving treatment for MG flare, including restarting pyridostigmine, and her electrolytes will be closely monitored. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 125/71 to 92/49 mmHg, heart rate between 57 and 120 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and platelets, with normal hemoglobin and creatinine levels. Imaging studies reveal sigmoid diverticulitis with adjacent punctate foci of air compatible with focal perforation, as well as new left lower lobe collapse secondary to mucus plugging/aspiration. The patient's current assessment and plan include stopping vancomycin,"

   Nondiagnostic study for evaluation of pulmonary embolism. No central
   thrombus. In case of continued clinical concern for pulmonary embolism,
   a repeat study can be obtained.
   CXR [**2176-5-2**]:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the tip
   of
   the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 2.6 cm above the
   carina.
   Nasogastric tube again extends well into the stomach. Extensive
   opacification
   is seen at the left base consistent with volume loss and pleural
   effusion.
   There is apparent opacification in the left perihilar region. This
   could
   represent an area of developing aspiration or volume loss related to
   mucus
   plugging.
   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old woman with hisotry of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] who presents with
   progressive abdominal pain and respiratory failure likely 2/2 MG flare
   vs PE.
   .
   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myesthenic crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis, T to 101.2 yesterday at 1600,
   but concomitant diverticulitis makes inflammatory markers less useful.
   Unable to move to PSV yesterday.  Per neuro, this is less likely
   myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**] based on exam, but recommended following NIFs and
   initiating IVIG if evidence of new weakness.  Also could be an element
   of splinting from abdominal pain.
   - Continue antibiotics
   - f/u Sputum culture
   - propofol for sedation
   - wean vent as tolerated, continue daily SBTs
   - follow NIFs/VCs/TVs while on vent (wean when VC>15, NIF<-30)
   - neuro recs
   .
   ## Diverticulitis: Diagnosed as o/p and confirmed by abdominal imaging
   here with focal perf no drainable fluid collection and no free air.
   Per surgery can restart PO.
   - continue zosyn
   - IVF PRN to keep UOP >30cc/hr
   - f/u surgery recs
   - start tube feeds, PO meds (clear with surgery)
   .
   ## HypoK: Had hypokalemia on last admission and in ED. Repleted in ED.
   - follow lytes
   - replete Prn
   - rechec K now
   .
   ## MG: As above may be in flare from diverticulitis. On pyridostigmine
   at home.
   - restart mestanone (pyridostigmine)
   - Checking NIFs/VC's Q6H
   - Avoid aminoglycosides as can precipitate MG
   - Avoid MG exacerbating meds prior
   - follow up neuro recs
   ,
   ## HTN: Has h/o HTN. Currently not hypertensive and propofol will drop
   bps so will hold meds for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis who presented with progressive abdominal pain and respiratory failure. The initial concern was pneumonia versus myasthenic crisis. She has been diagnosed with diverticulitis and her CT torso showed sigmoid diverticulitis with adjacent punctate foci of air compatible with focal perforation. There is also a new left lower lobe collapse secondary to mucus plugging/aspiration. The patient has hypoKalemia and requires repletion. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Her current medications include propofol for sedation, famotidine (Pepcid), and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if she is unable to be weaned off the ventilator or if she develops further complications such as pneumonia or aspiration.
2. Myasthenic Crisis: There is a concern for myasthenic crisis due to the patient's history of myasthenia gravis and the current respiratory failure. This can be exacerbated by infections or other stressors.
3. Diverticulitis Complications: The patient has diverticulitis with focal perforation, which increases the risk of abscess formation, peritonitis, or sepsis.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The left lower lobe collapse"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient with initial admission with respiratory distress and with
   hypoxia and hypercarbia in the setting of left lower lobe collapse
   concerning for pneumonia and patient with measured NIF decreased a
   component of neuro-muscular weakness has been raised as a concern but
   peripheral exam has not supported this.  We have bronchoscopy completed
   with reasonable clearance of airways proximally and are looking to move
   to wean of ventilator support as limited by patient tolerance.
   Pulmonary embolism was raised as a possibility but we have a
   presentation with hypercarbia and lesser contribution from hypoxia and
   CT scan without PE seen (although sub-optimal study) and alternative
   explanation of pneumonia and neuro-muscular weakness and opiod use all
   contributing to respiratory failure making PE very unlikely and with
   risk of bleeding and renal risk of dye load hperain remains
   discontinued.
   1)Respiratory Failure-This is a multifactorial source of respiratory
   failure with pneumonia certainly driving a component of this.  We have
   concern for muscular weakness but the rest of exam is reassuring and
   NIF if favorable this morning.  Finally, increased demand with active
   diverticulitis seen with hope for improved component of acitve sytsemic
   infection. With secretions reasonably controlled will move to
   -PSV support today
   -Check of RSBI if PEEP and FIO2 favorable but will need increased
   treatment time for pneumonia
   -Hope to move to extubation with stability seen in oxygenation and
   ventilation on these settings but will need substantial improvement in
   secretion volume.
   2)Pneumonia
Patient has clear evidence of focal opacity and now with
   fever noted across yesterday
pathogen not clearly seen
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl
continue for a minimum of 3 days
   -Continue with suctioning and pulmonary toilet as we have increased
   secretions through to this morning.
   -Continued suctioning and continue with PEEP
   3)Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]
   -NIF is -30 this morning
   -Chronic treatment in place
   -We do not have evidence of peripheral weakness
   -If treatment is required we will need to consider IV Ig and Cellcept
   4)DIVERTICULITIS-
   -Will continue with broad spectrum antibiotics
   -Will continue with bowel rest

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient's condition includes respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypercarbia. Initial assessment suggests left lower lobe collapse, pneumonia, and possible neuro-muscular weakness. A bronchoscopy was performed, showing clear airways without significant pathology. The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled secretions. The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications and is currently on multiple antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. Other comorbidities include diverticulitis, myasthenia gravis, and obesity. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal opacities without significant change in the chest X-ray and evidence of sigmoid diverticulitis with no focal fluid collection on the CT scan. The patient's current plan involves weaning off ventilator support, checking respiratory system compliance and incentive feedback, and managing pneumonia with continued broad-spectrum antibiotics. Long-term treatment for myasthenia gravis is being considered if necessary. The patient will continue with bowel rest and receive nutrition through tube feeds. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition remains in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old woman with hisotry of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] who presents with
   progressive abdominal pain and respiratory failure likely 2/2 MG flare
   vs PE.
   .
   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myasthenia crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis, no fever spikes overnight.
   Concomitant diverticulitis makes inflammatory markers less useful.
   Unable to move to PSV yesterday, continues on CMV.  Per neuro, this is
   less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**] based on exam, but recommend following
   NIFs and initiating IVIG if evidence of new weakness.  Also could be an
   element of splinting from abdominal pain.
   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 3
   - f/u sputum culture
   - propofol for sedation
   - wean vent as tolerated, continue daily SBTs
   - follow NIFs/VCs/TVs while on vent (wean when VC>15, NIF<-30)
   - neuro recs
   .
   ## Diverticulitis: Diagnosed as o/p and confirmed by abdominal imaging
   here with focal perf no drainable fluid collection and no free air.
   Per surgery can restart PO, but pt was not started on tube feeds
   yesterday.
   - continue zosyn
   - IVF PRN to keep UOP >30cc/hr
   - f/u surgery recs
   - consider starting tube feeds, PO meds (clear with surgery)
   .
   ## HypoK: Had hypokalemia on last admission and in ED. Repleted in ED.
   - follow lytes
   - replete Prn
   - rechec K now
   .
   ## MG: As above may be in flare from diverticulitis. On pyridostigmine
   at home.
   - restart mestanone (pyridostigmine)
   - Checking NIFs/VC's Q6H
   - Avoid aminoglycosides as can precipitate MG
   - Avoid MG exacerbating meds prior
   - follow up neuro recs
   ,
   ## HTN: Has h/o HTN. Currently not hypertensive and propofol will drop
   bps so will hold meds for now.
   .
   ## Anemia: Pt noted to have a HCT drop over the past few days: 42.4
   36.9
 35.1.  Unclear if this is secondary to ?perforation (GI source),
   antibiotics, or underlying infection.  No IVFs since [**5-2**] but LOS

 note
   above.
   Ms [**Known lastname 509**] is responsive to commands and has good strength in all
   extremities on minimal sedation.,
   Secretion output is minimal. Her FiO2 has been stable and CXR continues
   to show basilar infiltrates and atelectasis. We will place on CPAP/ PSV
   of [**6-12**] and recheck an ABG in 2 hrs. I suspect this is her window of
   opportunity to extubate before she has problems with nosocomial PNA.
   She will need aggressive chest PT, help with secretion clearance after
   extubation and prn BiPAP assistance with dyspnea and sleep ( h/o OSA on
   BiPAP 12/8 cms).  I do not believe she is in MG crisis at this time.
   NIF better at -30 cms and surgical staff have cleared her for oral
   feeds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis who presented with progressive abdominal pain and respiratory failure. She was initially suspected to have a pulmonary embolism or a myasthenic crisis. However, the CT angiogram (CTA) showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but it did reveal collapse of the left lower lobe (LLL) and a small left-sided pleural effusion. The chest X-ray (CXR) showed improvement in the LLL collapse but stable right lower lobe (RLL) process, which could be atelectasis or consolidation due to pneumonia.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, sedation with propofol, and mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 120/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. Her blood glucose levels have been within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, she has hypokalemia, with a potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.21, indicating respiratory acidosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a history of respiratory distress. Upon arrival, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been unstable, with increased pulmonary secretions and difficulty tolerating assisted ventilation. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed, which revealed no central or lobar pulmonary embolism (PE), but did show collapse of the left lower lobe (LLL), leftward shift of mediastinal structures, small left-sided pleural effusion, and right basilar atelectasis. The patient has been on aprv with high pressure 15 / low pressure 5 / time high 5 / time low 0.8, but did not tolerate it and was switched back to assist control with propofol. The patient also has a history of allergies to Prempro, Fiorinal, erythromycin base, and Aleve. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and has continued to experience increased pulmonary secretions. The presence of atelectasis and pleural effusion increases the risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening hypoxia.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the CTA did not reveal any central or lobar PEs, the patient's symptoms could still be indicative of a PE. Close monitoring for signs of PE, such as"

   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myasthenia crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis, no fever spikes overnight.
   Concomitant diverticulitis makes inflammatory markers less useful.
   Unable to move to PSV yesterday, continues on CMV.  Per neuro, this is
   less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**] based on exam, but recommend following
   NIFs and initiating IVIG if evidence of new weakness.  Also could be an
   element of splinting from abdominal pain.
   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 3
   - f/u sputum culture
   - propofol for sedation
   - wean vent as tolerated, continue daily SBTs
   - follow NIFs/VCs/TVs while on vent (wean when VC>15, NIF<-30)

   here with focal perf no drainable fluid collection and no free air.
   Per surgery can restart PO, but pt was not started on tube feeds
   yesterday.
   - continue zosyn
   - IVF PRN to keep UOP >30cc/hr

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis who presented with progressive abdominal pain and respiratory failure, likely due to a myasthenia crisis or pulmonary embolism. She has been diagnosed with diverticulitis and has several medical complications, including hypoKalemia, hypertension, and anemia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial concern was respiratory failure, which could be due to a myasthenia crisis or pneumonia. However, no organisms were found on bronchoscopy, and there is no leukocytosis or fever spikes overnight. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation, and daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) will be performed to assess weaning off the ventilator.

2. Diverticulitis: The patient has been diagnosed with diverticulitis, as confirmed by abdominal imaging. She is currently receiving antibiotics and will be restarted on tube feeds and oral medications once approved by the surgery team.

3. Hypokalemia: The patient had hypokalemia on her last admission and in the emergency department. It is important to monitor and replete potassium levels as necessary.

4. Myasthenia Gravis (MG): The patient's MG may be in a flare due to diverticulitis. She will be restarted on pyridostigmine and will have her neuromuscular"

   an element of splinting from abdominal pain.  Sputum, blood, urine
   cultures all negative to date.  Plan was to extubate patient this AM,
   but she is having large amounts of watery secretions that are making
   her unable to wean from propofol.  As this is in setting of pt being
   +6L LOS, concern for component of pulmonary edema, although CXR looks
   largely unchanged.
   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 4

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with
   the note above, including the assessment and plan.  To that I would add
   the following:
   Ms [**Known lastname 509**] has needed help with secretion clearance on CPAP/ PSV on
   [**5-4**] ( Q 2hr!) and this has precluded her extubation yesterday. She is
   low grade febrile but alert and quite responsive to commands. She is
   able to move all 4 extremities. NIF today is -20. Her CXR shows
   bilateral perihilar vascular congestion, bibasilar effusions vs
   atelectasis.
   She will need CVL placement today, dose reduction in mestinon ( 30 mg q
   6) and gentle diuresis to help with vent wean. I suspect she will have
   another attempt on CPAP/ PSV later today and if secretions are not
   limiting, possible extubation within next 24 hrs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and diverticular disease. She presented with progressive abdominal pain from diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with diverticulitis, hypoK, MG, and anemia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Despite being on mechanical ventilation, she continues to have watery secretions, which may indicate ongoing respiratory distress or the possibility of pulmonary edema. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's bilateral perihilar vascular congestion and bibasilar effusions on chest X-ray raise concerns about pulmonary edema. This condition can worsen respiratory function and may require diuretic therapy to manage fluid overload.
3. Diverticulitis Flare: The patient has been diagnosed with diverticulitis, which can lead to recurrent abdominal pain and potential complications such as perforation or abscess formation. Monitoring for signs of worsening abdominal pain or infection will be important.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient has a history of hypokalemia, which needs to be monitored and managed during her hospital stay. Electrolyte imbalances can affect cardiac and muscle function.

   65 year old woman with history of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and diverticular
   disease who presented with progressive abdominal pain from
   diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
   .
   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myasthenia crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis, no fever spikes overnight.
   Unable to move to PSV, continues on CMV.  Per neuro, this is less
   likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**] flare based on exam, but recommend following
   NIFs and initiating IVIG if evidence of new weakness.  Also patient had
   an element of splinting from abdominal pain.  Sputum, blood, urine
   cultures all negative to date.  Plan was to extubate patient this AM,
   but she is having large amounts of watery secretions that are making
   her unable to wean from propofol.  As this is in setting of pt being
   +6L LOS, concern for component of pulmonary edema, although CXR looks
   largely unchanged.
   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 4
   - Diurese with IV lasix today, goal -1L as BP tolerates. Given 20 mg IV
   lasix this AM.
   - propofol for sedation
   - wean vent as tolerated, continue daily SBTs
   - follow NIFs/VCs/TVs while on vent (wean when VC>15, NIF<-30)
   -  F/u neuro recs
   .
   ## Diverticulitis: Diagnosed as outpatient and confirmed by abdominal
   imaging here with focal microperfortaion without drainable fluid
   collection or free air.  Per surgery can restart PO, but pt was not
   started on tube feeds yesterday.
   - continue Zosyn
   - IVF PRN to keep UOP >30cc/hr
   - f/u surgery recs
   - consider starting tube feeds, PO meds
   .
   ## HypoK: Had hypokalemia on last admission and in ED, 3.1 this AM.
   Repleted in ED.
   - follow lytes [**Hospital1 **] now with diuresis and replete prn
   .
   ## MG: On pyridostigmine at home, 4 AM dose today held in anticipation
   of extubation.
   - Avoid aminoglycosides as can precipitate MG
   - follow up neuro recs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and diverticular disease. She presented with progressive abdominal pain from a diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The initial concern was between pneumonia and myasthenia crisis, but it is now believed to be less likely a myasthenia flare. The patient has been experiencing large amounts of watery secretions, making it difficult to wean her off propofol sedation. There are concerns about pulmonary edema, although the chest X-ray does not show significant changes. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and her sputum and urine cultures are also negative. 

The patient has diverticulitis, diagnosed as an outpatient and confirmed by abdominal imaging, with focal microperforation without drainable fluid collection or free air. She was not started on tube feeds yesterday. 

The patient also has hypoKalemia, which was repleted in the emergency department. 

Additionally, the patient has myasthenia gravis and hypertension. 

The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been dropping over the past few days, from 42.4 to 28.9. It is unclear if this is due to a GI source, antibiotics, volume overload with dilution, or underlying infection. 

Plan:

- Continue antibiotics for diverticulitis and pneumonia.
- Diurese with IV lasix to address possible pulmonary edema"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for several days. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided information. 

The patient experienced two significant events overnight. Firstly, the patient's peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines infiltrated. As a result, a PICC line was ordered but not placed due to the patient having a spike in temperature. The overnight nurse then placed an antecubital PIV instead. Secondly, the patient's propofol was turned down at 4 AM, leading to large amounts of watery thin secretions and the patient breathing over the ventilator. This suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema, as the patient is a 6L oxygen-dependent patient. Propofol was subsequently restarted.

The patient has several allergies, including Prempro (oral), Fiorinal (oral), Erythromycin base, and Aleve (oral). The patient also has a headache and leg edema. 

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). 

The patient is currently on multiple infusions, including famotidine (Pepcid), morphine sulfate, lorazepam (Ativan), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 117/90 mmHg"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old woman with history of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and diverticular
   disease who presented with progressive abdominal pain from
   diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
   .
   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myasthenia crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis.  Unable to move to PSV,
   continues on CMV.  Per neuro, this is less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**]
   flare based on exam, but recommend following NIFs and initiating IVIG
   if evidence of new weakness.  Also patient had an element of splinting
   from abdominal pain.  Sputum, blood, urine cultures all negative to
   date.  Plan was to extubate patient this AM, but she is having large
   amounts of watery secretions that are making her unable to wean from
   propofol.  As this is in setting of pt being +6L LOS, concern for
   component of pulmonary edema, although CXR looks largely unchanged.
   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 5
   - Diurese with IV lasix today, goal -1.5 - 2L as BP tolerates. Given 20
   mg IV lasix this AM.
   - propofol for sedation
   - continue daily SBTs
   - follow NIFs/VCs/TVs while on vent (wean when VC>15, NIF<-30)
   - repeat TTE, as we feel that volume may be complicating her
   respiratory status at this time.  Known moderate pulm HTN on echo in
   [**2172**].
   - uptitrate PEEP to 10 cm H2O to facilitate improved LLL expansion
   - f/u neuro recs; specific question is whether pyridostigmine can be
   held in anticipation for extubation as this may be causing her
   excessive secretions, which are complicating plan for extubation
   .
   ## Diverticulitis: Diagnosed as outpatient and confirmed by abdominal
   imaging here with focal microperforation without drainable fluid
   collection or free air.  Per surgery can restart PO, but pt was not
   started on tube feeds yesterday.
   - continue Zosyn
   - f/u surgery recs
   - nutrition recs re: tube feeds
   - start tube feeds
   .
   ## HypoK: Had hypokalemia on last admission and in ED, 3.1 this AM.
   Repleted in ED.
   - follow lytes [**Hospital1 **] now with diuresis and replete prn
   .
   ## MG: On pyridostigmine at home, 4 AM dose today held in anticipation
   of extubation.
   - Avoid aminoglycosides as can precipitate MG
   - follow up neuro recs
   .
   ## HTN: Has h/o HTN. Currently not hypertensive and propofol will drop
   bps so will hold meds for now.
   .
   ## Anemia: Pt noted to have a HCT drop over the past few days: 42.4

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and diverticular disease. She presented with progressive abdominal pain from diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The initial concern was between pneumonia and myasthenia crisis, but it is less likely to be a myasthenia flare based on the examination. The patient had an element of splinting from abdominal pain. Sputum, blood, and urine cultures were all negative. The plan was to extubate the patient this morning, but she is having large amounts of watery secretions that are making her unable to wean from propofol. As this is in the setting of the patient being +6L LOS, there is a concern for pulmonary edema, although the chest X-ray looks largely unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to excessive secretions and potential pulmonary edema.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's increased length of stay (+6L LOS) and symptoms may indicate pulmonary edema, which can be life-threatening if not managed appropriately.
3. Diverticulitis: The patient's diverticulitis may lead to complications such as abscess formation or perforation if not adequately treated.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may progress and lead to severe lung infection or sepsis if not effectively treated"

   65 year old woman with history of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and diverticular
   disease who presented with progressive abdominal pain from
   diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.

   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myasthenia crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis.  Unable to move to PSV,
   continues on CMV.  Per neuro, this is less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**]

   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 5
   - Diurese with IV lasix today, goal -1.5 - 2L as BP tolerates. Given 20

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and diverticular disease.
- She presented with progressive abdominal pain from diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
- The initial concern was whether it was a myasthenia crisis or pneumonia.
- She was unable to wean off mechanical ventilation, and there were concerns about pulmonary edema due to a positive fluid balance.
- She had large amounts of watery secretions, making extubation difficult.
- The patient had hypokalemia and required aggressive repletion of phosphorus.
- She was on pyridostigmine for myasthenia gravis, and her dose was held in anticipation of extubation.
- The plan was to continue antibiotics, diurese with IV lasix, use propofol for sedation, perform daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), and follow neurologic intensive care unit (NIFs)/ventilator weaning guidelines.
- A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was ordered to assess for volume status.
- The patient had a history of hypertension, but her blood pressure was currently not elevated.
- There were concerns about anemia, possibly due to dilution from fluid overload.
- The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 146/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. There is a concern for ongoing respiratory compromise due to the inability to wean off mechanical ventilation and the presence of watery secretions.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's positive fluid balance and symptoms may suggest the development of pulmonary edema. This needs to be further evaluated and managed appropriately.
3. Diverticulitis: The patient has a history of diverticular disease, and diverticulitis flare is suspected based on her symptoms. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any complications related to diverticulitis.
4. Myasthenia Gravis: The patient has a history of myasthenia gravis, and her condition may be exacerbated during the ICU stay. Close monitoring and adherence to neurologic recommendations are crucial.
5. Hypokalemia: The patient had hypokalemia on admission and during the ICU stay. Aggressive repletion of phosphorus is necessary, and electrolyte imbalances should be closely monitored.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been declining, which could be due to dilution from fluid overload or other causes. Further investigation and management are required.
7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, but her blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old woman with history of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and diverticular
   disease who presented with progressive abdominal pain from
   diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
   .
   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myasthenia crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis, no fever spikes overnight.
   Unable to move to PSV, continues on CMV.  Per neuro, this is less
   likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**] flare based on exam, but recommend following
   NIFs and initiating IVIG if evidence of new weakness.  Also patient had
   an element of splinting from abdominal pain.  Sputum, blood, urine
   cultures all negative to date.  Plan was to extubate patient this AM,
   but she is having large amounts of watery secretions that are making
   her unable to wean from propofol.  As this is in setting of pt being
   +6L LOS, concern for component of pulmonary edema, although CXR looks
   largely unchanged.
   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 4
   - Diurese with IV lasix today, goal -1L as BP tolerates. Given 20 mg IV
   lasix this AM.
   - propofol for sedation
   - wean vent as tolerated, continue daily SBTs
   - follow NIFs/VCs/TVs while on vent (wean when VC>15, NIF<-30)
   -  F/u neuro recs
   .
   ## Diverticulitis: Diagnosed as outpatient and confirmed by abdominal
   imaging here with focal microperfortaion without drainable fluid
   collection or free air.  Per surgery can restart PO, but pt was not
   started on tube feeds yesterday.
   - continue Zosyn
   - IVF PRN to keep UOP >30cc/hr
   - f/u surgery recs
   - consider starting tube feeds, PO meds
   .
   ## HypoK: Had hypokalemia on last admission and in ED, 3.1 this AM.
   Repleted in ED.
   - follow lytes [**Hospital1 **] now with diuresis and replete prn
   .
   ## MG: On pyridostigmine at home, 4 AM dose today held in anticipation
   of extubation.
   - Avoid aminoglycosides as can precipitate MG
   - follow up neuro recs
   ,
   ## HTN: Has h/o HTN. Currently not hypertensive and propofol will drop
   bps so will hold meds for now.
   .
   ## Anemia: Pt noted to have a HCT drop over the past few days: 42.4
   36.9

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and diverticular disease. She presented with progressive abdominal pain from a diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure: She continues to require mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The concern of myasthenia crisis has been ruled out by the neurologist. The patient is unable to wean from propofol due to large amounts of watery secretions. There is a concern for pulmonary edema, although the chest X-ray looks largely unchanged.
2. Diverticulitis: The patient was diagnosed with diverticulitis as an outpatient, and it was confirmed by abdominal imaging with focal microperforation without drainable fluid collection or free air. The plan is to restart tube feeds and PO medications once the patient is stable.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient had hypokalemia on her last admission and in the emergency department. She has been repleted in the ED, and her electrolytes will be followed closely during diuresis and repleted as needed.
4. Myasthenia Gravis (MG): The patient is on pyridostigmine at home, and her 4 AM dose today was held in anticipation of extubation. It is important to avoid aminoglycosides, which can precipitate MG"

   65 year old woman with history of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and diverticular
   disease who presented with progressive abdominal pain from
   diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
   .
   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myasthenia crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis.  Unable to move to PSV,
   continues on CMV.  Per neuro, this is less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**]
   flare based on exam, but recommend following NIFs and initiating IVIG
   if evidence of new weakness.  Also patient had an element of splinting
   from abdominal pain.  Sputum, blood, urine cultures all negative to
   date.  Plan was to extubate patient this AM, but she is having large
   amounts of watery secretions that are making her unable to wean from
   propofol.  As this is in setting of pt being +6L LOS, concern for
   component of pulmonary edema, although CXR looks largely unchanged.
   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 5
   - Diurese with IV lasix today, goal -1.5 - 2L as BP tolerates. Give IV
   lasix 20 this am.
   - propofol for sedation
   - continue daily SBTs
   - follow NIFs/VCs/TVs while on vent (wean when VC>15, NIF<-30)
   - repeat TTE, as we feel that volume may be complicating her
   respiratory status at this time.  Known moderate pulm HTN on echo in
   [**2172**].
   - uptitrate PEEP to 10 cm H2O to facilitate improved LLL expansion
   - f/u neuro recs; specific question is whether pyridostigmine can be
   held in anticipation for extubation as this may be causing her
   excessive secretions, which are complicating plan for extubation
   .
   ## Diverticulitis: Diagnosed as outpatient and confirmed by abdominal
   imaging here with focal microperforation without drainable fluid
   collection or free air.  Per surgery can restart PO, but pt was not
   started on tube feeds yesterday.
   - continue Zosyn
   - f/u surgery recs
   - nutrition recs re: tube feeds
   - start tube feeds
   .
   ## HypoK: Had hypokalemia on last admission and in ED, 3.5 this AM.
   - follow lytes [**Hospital1 **] now with diuresis and replete prn
   .
   ## MG: On pyridostigmine at home, 4 AM dose today held in anticipation
   of extubation.
   - Avoid aminoglycosides as can precipitate MG
   - f/u neuron recs
   .
   ## HTN: Has h/o HTN. Currently not hypertensive and propofol will drop
   bps so will hold meds for now.
   .
   ## Anemia: Pt noted to have a HCT drop over the past few days: 42.4

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and diverticular disease. She presented with progressive abdominal pain from a diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, initially suspected to be caused by pneumonia or myasthenia crisis. Further evaluation by the neurologist suggests that this is less likely to be a myasthenia flare-up, but they recommend following NIFs (neuromuscular function tests) and initiating IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) if there is evidence of new weakness. The patient also had an element of splinting from abdominal pain. Sputum, blood, and urine cultures have all been negative to date.

2. Pulmonary Edema: There is concern for a component of pulmonary edema, although the chest X-ray looks largely unchanged. The patient has been +6L for length of stay, which may contribute to the development of pulmonary edema.

3. Hypokalemia: The patient has had hypokalemia on previous admissions and in the emergency department, with a current level of 3.5 mmol/L. The plan is to follow electrolytes closely with diuresis and replete potassium as needed.

4. Myasthenia Gravis: The patient is on py"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and diverticular disease. She presented with progressive abdominal pain from diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, diverticulitis, hypoKalemia, myasthenia gravis, hypertension, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing pulmonary secretions are preventing extubation attempt. If not managed properly, it can lead to further respiratory distress and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Diverticulitis: The patient has focal microperforation without drainable fluid collection or free air. If untreated, it may progress to a severe infection and potentially require surgical intervention.
3. HypoKalemia: The patient's low potassium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other electrolyte imbalances if not corrected promptly.
4. Myasthenia Gravis: Holding pyridostigmine as part of MG flare diagnosis can result in muscle weakness and respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, but currently not hypertensive. If antihypertensive medications are not restarted, it may lead to uncontrolled high blood pressure and potential organ damage.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, which can cause fatigue, weakness"

   Imaging: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function
   is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
   (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall
   is hypertrophied. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-12-16**], the
   findings are similar. Mild biiventricular hypertrophy was present in

   65 year old woman with history of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and diverticular
   disease who presented with progressive abdominal pain from
   diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
   .
   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myasthenia crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis.  Unable to move to PSV,
   continues on CMV.  Per neuro, this is less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**]
   flare based on exam, but recommend following NIFs and initiating IVIG
   if evidence of new weakness, which they define as no improvement in the
   face of held mestinon and diuresis.  As this was in setting of pt being
   +6L LOS, we started diuresis on [**5-6**]. She is now 3.8L postive for LOS.
   Sputum, blood, urine cultures all negative to date.  Plan was to
   extubate patient this AM, but she is having large amounts of watery
   secretions that are making her unable to wean from propofol.  TTE shows
   hyperdynamic myocardium with preserved systolic function, given trivial
   TR/Jet, PA pressures are indeterminate.
   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 6
   - Diurese with IV lasix today, goal -1.5 - 2L as BP tolerates. Give
   another IV lasix 20 this am.
   - propofol for sedation
   - continue daily SBTs
   - follow NIFs/VCs/TVs while on vent (wean when VC>15, NIF<-30)
   - uptitrate PEEP to 10 cm H2O to facilitate improved LLL expansion
   - f/u neuro recs; specific question is whether pyridostigmine can be
   held in anticipation for extubation as this may be causing her
   excessive secretions, which are complicating plan for extubation
   .
   ## Diverticulitis: Diagnosed as outpatient and confirmed by abdominal
   imaging here with focal microperforation without drainable fluid
   collection or free air.  Per surgery can restart PO, we are advancing
   tube feeds
   - continue Zosyn
   - f/u surgery recs
   - nutrition recs re: tube feeds
   - start tube feeds

   ## HypoK: Had hypokalemia on last admission and in ED, 3.4 this AM.
   Compounded by diuresis.
   - follow lytes [**Hospital1 **] now with diuresis and replete prn
   .
   ## MG: On pyridostigmine at home, holding as part of MG Flare diagnosis
   per neuro.
   - Avoid aminoglycosides as can precipitate MG
   - f/u neuro recs

   ## HTN: Has h/o HTN. Currently not hypertensive and propofol will drop

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and diverticular disease. She presented with progressive abdominal pain from diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. She was initially concerned for possible pneumonia versus myasthenia crisis. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been unable to wean off due to excessive secretions. Her imaging shows mild biiventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function and trivial mitral regurgitation. She has a history of hypokalemia and anemia, both of which are being managed in the ICU. The patient's current plan includes continuing antibiotics, diuresis with IV lasix, sedation with propofol, daily spontaneous breathing trials, following neurology recommendations, advancing tube feeds, and monitoring electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to wean off mechanical ventilation suggests ongoing respiratory compromise. The excessive secretions and hyperdynamic myocardium may contribute to this issue.
2. Myasthenia crisis: The patient's history of myasthenia gravis and the current presentation with respiratory failure raise concerns for a myasthenia crisis. This is further supported by the neurology recommendations to hold pyridostigmine and initiate IVIG if there is evidence of new weakness.
3. Diverticulitis flare: The patient has a history of diverticular disease and was diagnosed with diverticulitis during"

   Imaging: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function
   is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
   (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall
   is hypertrophied. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-12-16**], the
   findings are similar. Mild biiventricular hypertrophy was present in

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old woman with history of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and diverticular
   disease who presented with progressive abdominal pain from
   diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
   .
   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myasthenia crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis.  Unable to move to PSV,
   continues on CMV.  Per neuro, this is less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**]
   flare based on exam, but recommend following NIFs and initiating IVIG
   if evidence of new weakness, which they define as no improvement in the
   face of held mestinon and diuresis.  As this was in setting of pt being
   +6L LOS, we started diuresis on [**5-6**]. She is now 3.8L postive for LOS.
   Sputum, blood, urine cultures all negative to date.  Plan was to
   extubate patient this AM, but she is having large amounts of watery
   secretions that are making her unable to wean from propofol.  TTE shows
   hyperdynamic myocardium with preserved systolic function, given trivial
   TR/Jet, PA pressures are indeterminate.
   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 6
   - Diurese with IV lasix today, goal -1.5 - 2L as BP tolerates. Give
   another IV lasix 20 this am.
   - propofol for sedation
   - continue daily SBTs
   - follow NIFs/VCs/TVs while on vent (wean when VC>15, NIF<-30)
   - uptitrate PEEP to 10 cm H2O to facilitate improved LLL expansion
   - f/u neuro recs; specific question is whether pyridostigmine can be
   held in anticipation for extubation as this may be causing her
   excessive secretions, which are complicating plan for extubation
   .
   ## Diverticulitis: Diagnosed as outpatient and confirmed by abdominal
   imaging here with focal microperforation without drainable fluid
   collection or free air.  Per surgery can restart PO, we are advancing
   tube feeds
   - continue Zosyn
   - f/u surgery recs
   - nutrition recs re: tube feeds
   - start tube feeds

   ## MG: On pyridostigmine at home, holding as part of MG Flare diagnosis
   per neuro.
   - Avoid aminoglycosides as can precipitate MG
   - Could restart pyridostigmine once successfully extubated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and diverticular disease. She presented with progressive abdominal pain from diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The initial concern was whether the respiratory failure was due to pneumonia or a myasthenic crisis. However, the neurologist believes it is less likely to be a myasthenic flare based on the examination.

The patient has been unable to be extubated due to large amounts of watery secretions. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows hyperdynamic myocardium with preserved systolic function. The estimated cardiac index is normal, and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal left ventricular filling pressures. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal, but there is mild right ventricular hypertrophy. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated, and the aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but there is no aortic stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are also mildly thickened, but there is no prolapse, and only trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined, and there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The patient has been on antibiotics for diverticulitis and pneumonia. Diuretics have been started due to positive fluid balance. Prop"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and diverticular disease. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and a diverticulitis flare. The initial concern was whether the respiratory failure was due to pneumonia or myasthenia crisis. However, the neurologist assessed that this was less likely to be a myasthenia flare based on the examination.

The patient was unable to move to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and continued on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV). IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) was recommended if there was evidence of new weakness, defined as no improvement in the face of held mestinon and diuresis. The patient had large amounts of watery secretions, which made extubation unsuccessful. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed hyperdynamic myocardium with preserved systolic function. Pulmonary artery pressures were indeterminate. Negative inspiratory force (NIF) was -60 on day 5-7, so the patient was extubated and mestinon was restarted 6-8 hours thereafter.

   65 year old woman with history of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and diverticular
   disease who presented with progressive abdominal pain from
   diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
   .
   ## Respiratory Failure: Initial concern of PNA vs. myasthenia crisis.
   No organisms on bronch, no leukocytosis.  Unable to move to PSV,
   continues on CMV.  Per neuro, this is less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**]
   flare based on exam, but recommend following NIFs and initiating IVIG
   if evidence of new weakness, which they define as no improvement in the
   face of held mestinon and diuresis.  As this was in setting of pt being
   +6L LOS, we started diuresis on [**5-6**]. She is now 3.8L postive for LOS.
   Sputum, blood, urine cultures all negative to date.  Plan was to
   extubate patient this AM, but she is having large amounts of watery
   secretions that are making her unable to wean from propofol.  TTE shows
   hyperdynamic myocardium with preserved systolic function, given trivial
   TR/Jet, PA pressures are indeterminate. NIF was -60 on [**5-7**] so patient
   was extubated and mestinon restarted 6-8 hours thereafter.
   - Continue antibiotics: Vanc/Zosyn day 7, plan to d/c Vanc after
   completing 8 days; Zosyn after completing 14 days (will confirm with
   surgery recs)
   - hold on diuresis given contraction bicarb
   - Doing well off extubation, CPAP at night, PT and OOB to chair to
   prevent atelectasis
   .
   ## Diverticulitis: Diagnosed as outpatient and confirmed by abdominal
   imaging here with focal microperforation without drainable fluid
   collection or free air.  Per surgery can restart PO, we are advancing
   tube feeds
   - continue Zosyn for 2 week course, will confirm duration with surgery
   recs
   - f/u surgery recs --> f/u outpatient
   - nutrition recs re: tube feeds
   - tubefeeds and advancing diet, will try regular diet today
   .
   ## HypoK: Had hypokalemia on last admission and in ED, 3.4 this AM.
   Compounded by diuresis.
   - follow lytes
   .
   ## MG: On pyridostigmine at home, restarted yesterday after successful
   extubation
   - Avoid aminoglycosides as can precipitate MG
   - Continue pyridostigmine home dose
   - f/u neuro recs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of Myasthenia Gravis and diverticular disease. She presented with progressive abdominal pain from diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. 

The patient was initially intubated due to respiratory failure and diagnosed with possible myasthenic crisis or pneumonia. However, no organisms were found on bronchoscopy, and there was no leukocytosis. The patient was unable to be weaned off mechanical ventilation, so she remained on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode.

The patient's large amounts of watery secretions made extubation unsuccessful, so she was not extubated as planned. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed hyperdynamic myocardium with preserved systolic function, with trivial tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary artery (PA) pressures being indeterminate. Negative inspiratory force (NIF) was -60 on day 7, and the patient was successfully extubated and restarted on pyridostigmine (Mestinon) 6-8 hours later.

The patient's current medications include pyridostigmine bromide 60 mg orally/nasogastric every 8 hours, BP medications of HCTZ and metoprolol, and prophylactic antibiotics. She has been advanced to tube feeds and is being tried on a regular diet.

The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and diverticular disease. She presented with progressive abdominal pain due to diverticulitis flare and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The initial concern was whether the respiratory failure was caused by pneumonia or a myasthenia crisis. The patient has been on invasive ventilation but tolerated extubation well and is now on CPAP. She is being weaned off propofol. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure which was initially thought to be due to pneumonia or myasthenia crisis. She is currently on CPAP and showing improvement.
2. Diverticulitis: The patient has diverticulitis with focal microperforation without drainable fluid collection or free air. She is being advanced to tube feeds and her diet.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient had hypokalemia on previous admission and in the emergency department. It has compounded due to diuresis. She needs close monitoring of electrolytes.
