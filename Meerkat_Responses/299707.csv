   ANEMIA -- decrease in setting of recent renal bx, iv fluid
   resussitation.  Monitor serial Hct.
   RENAL INSUFFICIENCY -- prerenal failure in background of renal
   insufficiency.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia --> improved.  Continue repletion to maintain BP,
   P and urine output.
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- stable dose of flolan.  continue.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypotension attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis. They have a history of allergies, including penicillins, tetracyclines, plaquenil, chloroquine, sulfonamides, floxin, and heparin agents. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some constitutional symptoms. Vital signs show fever, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, normal cardiovascular exam, clear respiratory sounds, soft abdomen, and warm skin. Lab results indicate anemia, renal insufficiency, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient is being treated for hypotension, sepsis, anemia, renal insufficiency, pulmonary hypertension, and HIT. They are receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's condition is critical, and they have a code status of full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The patient presented with hypotension, which is attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis. The hypotension has improved, and the patient's blood pressure should be monitored, maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60.

The patient also has sepsis, as indicated by a low-grade temperature and concern for line-related infection. Empirical antibiotics, including Daptomycin and Levofloxacin, have been administered, and the patient is awaiting culture results.

Anemia has been observed, likely due to recent renal biopsy and intravenous fluid resuscitation. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) will be monitored serially.

Renal insufficiency is present, with pre-renal failure in the background of renal insufficiency. The patient's urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels will be monitored.

The patient has pulmonary hypertension and is on a stable dose of flolan. This medication will continue to be administered.

The patient has heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT +), so heparin should be avoided.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's code status is full code, and the"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of lupus, pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and recent kidney biopsy. She presented with hypotension refractory to IV fluid resuscitation at another hospital. The patient has been diagnosed with line sepsis, likely secondary to GPCs. She is currently on antibiotics (Daptomycin) and has cultures pending at another hospital.

The patient's PHTN is stable, and she is back on home oxygen at rest but not on exertion. She continues to receive Flolan and Lasix as tolerated. Coumadin has been held until Saturday, and the patient's oxygen saturation levels will be maintained above 93%. There is a consideration for adding a second [**Doctor Last Name**] as per the primary pulmonologist, but it is being held for now.

The patient's lupus nephritis has shown recent worsening of proteinuria, with a protein/creatinine ratio of 8, improved from 15-16 on [**9-27**]. Renal function will be followed.

Oral hypoglycemics have been held, and the patient is receiving insulin subcutaneously (ISS).

The patient's depression/anxiety medications have been restarted, with consideration of potential interactions with antibiotics. She is currently on Cymbalta, amitriptyline, and Wellbutrin.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a medical history of lupus, pulmonary hypertension, and recent kidney biopsy. The patient presented with hypotension refractory to intravenous fluid resuscitation at OSH and was found to have a central line infection. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics for the central line infection and is on multiple medications for her various conditions including pulmonary hypertension, lupus nephritis, depression/anxiety, migraines, and renal diet.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure ranging from 128/80 to 140/89 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm and her general appearance is cushingoid with no jaundice or pallor.

The patient has crackles in the bases of the lungs that are louder on the left side, decreased tenderness over the right chest tunneled Hickman line, no purulence or drainage, minimal erythema, and trace edema in the extremities. Neurological examination reveals intact cranial nerves 2-12 and adequate airway, breathing, and circulation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.4, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 121,000/mm3, creatinine of 1.3, glucose of 108 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.02. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's recent laboratory results show improvement in proteinuria from a previous ratio of 15-16 to the current ratio of 8. The patient's renal function will be followed closely.

The patient's current medications include daptomycin, levoquinol, epoprostenol, lasix, coumadin, supplemental oxygen, cymbalta, amitriptyline, wellbutrin, fluconazole, bowel regimen, and regular renal diet.

The patient's disposition is planned for the ICU with potential transfer to a 3-step down medicine service on the [**Hospital Ward Name 790**]."

   Pt is a 51 yo female with lupus and pulm HTN now s/p kidney biopsy and
   recent discharge for right cardiac cath who is presenting with
   hypotension refractory to IVF resuscitation at OSH.
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension concerning for SIRS/sepsis or bleed given
   recent procedure, renal biopsy. Other possible etiologies include
   adrenal insufficiency given chronic steroid use and recent procedure,
   medication effect since recently started on Lisinopril, or medication
   effect from Flolan, possible dysfunction although no recent change in
   dose or reported problems. [**Name (NI) 1816**] likely SIRS/sepsis given fever, low
   WBC. Most likely etiology is line infection given tunneled Hickmans x 1
   year, h/o similar episodes in past and c/o tenderness. In past, pt has
   grown Micrococcus from line and blood cx. Due to interactions with
   Linezolid and Amitriptyline (which pt refuses to stop taking) she has
   been treated with Dapto in past as well as levoflox for gram neg
   coverage. Also consider pneumonia, UTI, although no other localizing
   symptoms. Cardiogenic shock less likely cause of hypotension given lack
   of cardiac symptoms and other signs of infection including fever. Here,
   BP has been responsive to IVF with current SBPs high 90s to 100s.
   - IVF NS at 150cc/hour. Has received 4 liters NS at OSH. Appears
   slightly dry on exam with dry mucus menbranes but pulmonary exam with
   crackles, concern for fluid overload. WIll follow mental status, UOP to
   assess need for IVF resuscitation and continue continuous IVF
   - Daptomycin and Levofloxacin for now for empiric coverage
   - Serial lactate to assess hypoperfusion
   - repeat HCT to assess possible bleed, transfuse PRBC to maintain
   HCT>21 or signs active bleed, check coags
   - Will need to assess need to change line given possible line infection
   - UA, urine cx
   - Follow up blood cx from OSH and repeat blood cx x 2 here
   - Consult ID in am given multiple allergies h/o Micrococcus bacteremia,
   ? appropriate ABx use and duration
   - Renal Ultrasound to assess for hematoma/abscess/fluid collection
   after procedure
   - CEs to ROMI. ECG without acute changes
   - Hold Lisinoprol, home Lasix for now
   - If BP remains low will consider stress dose steroids
   .
   #Fever: Most likely [**2-21**] infection as above but also could have
   inflammatory component given worsening lupus recently, low grade fevers
   x 6months.
   - Fever workup and treat infection as above
   .
   #Pulmonary hypertension: Recent cardiac cath demonstrated severe pulm
   HTN despite Flolan.
   - Continue Flolan
   - Will readd Lasix as BP tolerates, holding for now
   - Off Coumadin until Saturday, will assess for bleed, HCT drop
   - Continue supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 sats >93%
   - Consider addition second [**Doctor Last Name **] as per primary pulmonologist but hold
   for now  given hypotension
   .
   # Lupus nephritis: Patient has lupus nephritis with recent worsening of
   proteinuria, most recently Protein/creatinine ratio 8, improved from
   15-16 [**9-27**].
   - Follow renal function (no labs in system yet today)
   .
   # DM: holding oral hypoglycemics, on ISS
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety: Pt on multiple meds at home. Concern for
   serotonin syndrome given multiple medications and received Linezolid.
   Was going to continue Linezolid but contraindicated with Amitriptyline
   and pt refuses to stop amitriptyline. Per pharmacy, should not
   administer both medications. Linezolid changed to Dapto as per prior
   admission.
   - Continued Cymbalta, amitriptyline, holding Wellbutrin
   .
   #Migraines: Continuing Amitrityline
   .
   # FEN: NPO for renal US
   .
   # PPX: Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis (Questionable h/o HIT) ?why pt
   is on fluconazole will continue for now for presumed fungal PPX, bowel
   regimen
   .
   # ACCESS: Hickman, 20g PIV x 2

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of lupus and pulmonary hypertension who has recently undergone a kidney biopsy. She is currently presenting with hypotension that is refractory to intravenous fluid resuscitation. The possible etiologies for her hypotension include sepsis, bleeding (due to recent procedure), adrenal insufficiency (given chronic steroid use and recent procedure), medication effect (from Lisinopril or Flolan), or a line infection.

The patient's fever and low white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, with the most likely source being a line infection due to a tunneled Hickman line that has been in place for over a year. The patient has had similar episodes in the past and complains of tenderness at the site of the line. Micrococcus has been cultured from the line and blood cultures in previous episodes.

Other potential complications or conditions mentioned in the note include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cardiogenic shock (less likely), lupus nephritis, diabetes mellitus, depression/anxiety, migraines, femoral nerve entrapment, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes intravenous fluids, antibiotics (Daptomycin and Levofloxacin), serial lactate measurements to assess for hypoperfusion, blood transfusions if necessary, assessment and potential change of the Hickman line, urinalysis"
