   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   1. Respiratory failure, with hypoxemia and hypercapnia
   Her respiratory distress is very likely multifactorial, with
   contributions from pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Poor rate
   control could be worsening her breathlessness. Her lung mets might also
   be contributory, as could pulmonary hypertension. Pna possible clinical
   evidence less compelling - she does carry dx of achalasia which would
   put potentially increase her risk of aspiration. Also think PE is less
   likely.
   - Will continue diuresis on lasix drip with goal -1 to 2L daily as she
   is still likely total body volume overloaded. She is currently
   responding well to her lasix drip. Will hold off on adding
   thiazide-type diuretic at this point. Will tolerate rise in creatinine
   at this point as volume seems to be her primary problem. Renal
   consulted in CCU, recommendations appreciated regarding
   ?ultrafiltration
   - If develops increasing respiratory distress will reattempt BiPAP as
   tolerated. Per discussion with transferring team, patient had agreed to
   limited trial of intubation if necessary. Intubation may be technically
   difficult per anesthesiology.
   - Ok to continue vancomycin and zosyn for now given recent temps and
   respiratory distress, will attempt sputum gram stain and culture if she
   can expectorate any sputum, check legionella urinary antigen though
   probably low yield at this point.
   - Follow I/O, daily weight, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Aspiration precautions
   - Given coagulopathy will hold off on thoracentesis for now
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Plan for diuresis and monitoring as above. Although her EF was measured
   within the normal range, she does have at least moderate MR on her
   echocardiogram which would decrease her effective forward output.
   Optimizing rate control of her atrial fibrillation may also be helpful
   allowing for increased filling time. Cardiology recommendations
   appreciated.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Rate moderately well controlled on IV diltiazem; oral agents held in
   setting of BiPAP. Will resume oral diltiazem and follow closely - her
   absoption of PO meds may be decreased secondary to gut edema. Hold
   anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR today.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Low grade temps, may be secondary to a pneumonia but in setting of
   foley would also consider UTI. No obvious infection at her PICC site or
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile colitis.
   -          check blood, urine, and sputum cultures along with stool C.
   difficile toxin if she has diarrhea
 COAGULOPATHY
   Possible secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic decrease in vitamin K
   levels. No evidence for DIC on labs. Repleted with vitamin K today.
   Will trend INR daily, resume warfarin for INR<2.5.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Cover with insulin sliding scale, qachs fingerstick target <150
 THYROID CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   suppressed TSH
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Most likely due to diuresis leading to pre-renal state. Willing to
   tolerate moderate rise in creatinine due to need for volume removal.
   Urinalysis, check urine lytes.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The note provides detailed information about the patient's condition, treatment, and potential medical complications.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress with hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Contributing factors include pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, poor rate control, lung mets, and possible pulmonary hypertension. The plan includes continuing diuresis on Lasix drip, holding off on adding a thiazide-type diuretic, and considering ultrafiltration.

2. Heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute on chronic: The patient has diastolic heart failure with moderate mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram. The plan involves diuresis and monitoring.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's atrial fibrillation is moderately well-controlled on IV diltiazem. Oral agents will be resumed once the patient is off BiPAP. Anticoagulation will be held due to a supratherapeutic INR.

4. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has low-grade temperatures, which may be secondary to pneumonia or a urinary tract infection (UTI). Blood, urine, and sputum cultures, as well as stool C. difficile toxin if present, should be checked.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, thyroid cancer, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, heart failure (diastolic), Crohn's disease, and a decubitus ulcer. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute on chronic heart failure, and other acute issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress may be caused by several factors including pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, poor rate control, lung metastases, and potential aspiration due to achalasia.

2. Heart Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. Diuretics and monitoring will be continued to manage fluid balance.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently in atrial fibrillation. Rate control is being attempted with IV diltiazem.

4. Fever: The patient has low-grade temperatures, which could be secondary to pneumonia or a urinary tract infection. Cultures have been ordered to identify the cause.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient had markedly improved coagulopathy with vitamin K dosing. She will not restart coumadin at this time but will be placed on subcutaneous heparin.

6. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's diabetes will be managed with insulin sliding scale coverage.

7. Thyroid Cancer: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   1. Respiratory failure, with hypoxemia and hypercapnia
   Her respiratory distress is very likely multifactorial, with
   contributions from pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Poor rate
   control could be worsening her breathlessness. Her lung mets might also
   be contributory, as could pulmonary hypertension. Pna possible clinical
   evidence less compelling - she does carry dx of achalasia which would
   put potentially increase her risk of aspiration. Also think PE is less
   likely.
   - Will continue lasix boluses to attempt to diuresis 100 cc/hr if BP
   will tolerate
   - If develops increasing respiratory distress will reattempt BiPAP as
   tolerated. Currently comfortable and satting well on NC, and allows
   patient to get more rest as she is uncomfortable on BiPAP
   - Ok to continue vancomycin and zosyn for now given recent temps and
   respiratory distress, will follow cutures
   - Follow I/O, daily weight, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Aspiration precautions
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Plan for diuresis and monitoring as above.
   -f/u on Cardiology recs
   -Repeat ECHO to eval MR, and what appears to be worsening cardiac
   failure despite aggressive in house diuresis from admission
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Rate moderately well controlled on IV diltiazem, but appears to break
   through, will start on Diltiazem drip
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Low grade temps, may be secondary to a pneumonia but in setting of
   foley would also consider UTI. No obvious infection at her PICC site or
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile colitis.
   -          check blood, urine, and sputum cultures along with stool C.
   difficile toxin if she has diarrhea
   -          continue abx as above
 COAGULOPATHY
   -Markedly improved with small vitamin K dosing
   -will not restart coumadin at this time, but will place patient on SQ
   heparin
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Cover with insulin sliding scale, qachs fingerstick target <150
 THYROID CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   suppressed TSH, repeat TSH low, but FT4 normal, will not take further
   action at this time
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Most likely due to diuresis leading to pre-renal state. Willing to
   tolerate moderate rise in creatinine due to need for volume removal.
   Urinalysis, check urine lytes.
