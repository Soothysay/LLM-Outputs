 NEUTROPENIA
 ACUTE PAIN
   49-year-old M with a history of APML s/p multiple rounds of
   chemotherapy who recently underwent MIDAM chemotherapy and was admitted
   to the BMT service with febrile neutropenia, GNR bacteremia, and recent
   diarrhea.  He now has progressive hepatic failure with a markedly
   distended abdomen which is compromising his respiratory status.
   # Abdominal pain and distension: Progressive since admission and
   particularly over the last day.  No clear edema or excess bowel gas
   seen on images. Seems to be almost entirely bowel/mesenteric edema
   which could fit with several processes: hepatic congestion, diffuse
   peritoneal infection/inflammation.  Peritioneal signs difficult to
   assess in this profoundly neutropenic pt with a limited inflammatory
   response.  Presumed source of GNR bacteremia is translocation across
   gut
CT abdomen negative for obvious perf, but cannot r/o microperf.
   - follow up final CT reads on multiple studies
   - low threshold for re-imaging with changes in clinical situation
   - follow up pending cultures
   - continue abx as below & ID c/s for question of double-covering GNRs
   in setting of PCN allergy
   - fluid resuscitation as below given extensive third spacing into
   abdomen
   - surgery following
   # Febrile Neutropenia / GNR bacterimia:  ANC is currently 60
profoundly
   neutropenic.  Unclear if GNR bacteremia is secondary to GI process
   which facilitated translocation across gut
will be clearer once GNR
   speciated and when we can determine if this is polymicrobial which
   would strongly argue for GI source.  Previously on double-GNR covg with
   aztreonam and CIPRO, but now off Cipro as it has rarely been implicated
   in case studies as a cause of hepatitis. ID consulting on other options
   vs restarting Cipro.
   - CURRENT ABX: Vanco ([**6-20**]-), Aztreonam ([**6-20**]-), Flagyl ([**6-20**]-),
   Micafungin ([**6-21**]-), Cipro ([**Date range (1) 6206**])
   - ?plan for G-CSF, check in w BMT
   - stool assays pending
   - serial chest x-rays
   - culture if spikes; f/u blood cultures
   - trend fever curve
   - Acyclovir 400mg TID
need to d/w BMT re: acyclovir vs gancyclovir
   (more hepatotoxic)
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Question of VOD [**3-2**] chemotherapy effect, vs
   hepatitis vs diffuse abdominal infection vs CMV. Lack of elevated alk
   phos argues against a ductal obstruction, pt has no gallbladder.
   - liver service consulted regarding further diagnosis and mgt
   - d/w surgery and rads re: best study to evaluate for VOD; given how
   poor liver US was for biliary eval, likely we would not get good
   dopplers
   - no intervention currently
   - exercise caution with benzos, etc given progressive hepatic
   impairment.
   # Tachypnea: Pt with suppressed tdal volumes secondary to abdominal
   distension and thus compensating with increase in RR. Concern is that
   he may tire if this persist or worsens.  Do not believe that pain
   contributing got tachypnea as pt denies. Will monitor closely.
   -ABG this AM
   - Consider a-line although complicated in this pt with such prononunced
   thrombocytopenia.
   # Fluid Resuscitation/ Tachycardia: Likely intravascularly depleted
   given rapidity of third spacing into abdomen.  Given increased work of
   breathing and ongoing infxn, tachycardia may not resolve with
   hydration.  Will bolus with goal of maintaining UOP. Would use levophed
   as pressor, avoid vasopressin and neo for effects on mesenteric
   circulation.
   - 2L NS thia AM and re-assess
   # APML: Holding ATRA, will discus further mgt of AML w/ BMT.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to profound marrow
   suppression from therapy. Transfuse to keep platelets > 20K per BMT
   recs.  Refractory to Plt transfusions
 getting HLA matching of plts b/c
   may have anti-plt Ab. Need to f/u on this issue with blood bank.
   # Anemia: Impossible to tell whether pt is hemolyzing as LDH may be
   elevated from bowel process. Hapto useless as s/p multiple
   transfusions. Bili elevated [**3-2**] hepatic process.  Will trend CBC q6H.
   Also checking DIC labs [**Hospital1 **].

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who recently underwent chemotherapy and was admitted to the bone marrow transplant service with febrile neutropenia, gram-negative bacteremia, and recent diarrhea. The patient is now experiencing progressive hepatic failure with a markedly distended abdomen, which is compromising his respiratory status.

The patient's abdominal pain and distension have been progressive since admission and particularly over the last day. No clear edema or excess bowel gas is seen on images. It seems to be almost entirely bowel/mesenteric edema, which could fit with several processes: hepatic congestion, diffuse peritoneal infection/inflammation. Peritoneal signs are difficult to assess in this profoundly neutropenic patient with a limited inflammatory response. The presumed source of gram-negative bacteremia is translocation across the gut.

The patient's fever and neutropenia indicate a high risk for infection. The presence of gram-negative bacteremia suggests a potential source of infection in the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's hepatic failure may be secondary to various causes such as chemotherapy effect, hepatitis, diffuse abdominal infection, or cytomegalovirus infection. The lack of elevated alkaline phosphatase argues against a ductal obstruction, and the patient has no gallbladder.

The patient's tachypnea is likely due to suppressed tidal volumes secondary to abdominal distension and respiratory muscle fatigue. The concern is that he may tire"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute pancreatitis. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to severe abdominal pain and was found to have elevated levels of amylase and lipase. Imaging studies revealed intra-abdominal free fluid and minimal changes in the overall degree of intra-peritoneal stranding, indicating the progression of pancreatitis.

The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, leading to respiratory failure. He is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 38 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 33 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 216, which indicates moderate hypoxemia.

The patient is also experiencing pancytopenia, neutropenia, and bacteremia with growth of Proteus vulgaris and other gram-negative rods (GNRs) in blood cultures. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated, including meropenem, aztreonam, vancomycin, micafungin, and metronidazole.

Other notable findings include elevated levels of liver enzymes"

   49-year-old M with a history of APML s/p multiple rounds of
   chemotherapy who recently underwent MIDAM chemotherapy and was admitted
   to the BMT service with febrile neutropenia, GNR bacteremia, and recent
   diarrhea.  He now has progressive hepatic failure with a markedly
   distended abdomen which is compromising his respiratory status.
   # Abdominal pain and distension: Progressive since admission and
   particularly over the last day.  No clear edema or excess bowel gas
   seen on images. Seems to be almost entirely bowel/mesenteric edema
   which could fit with several processes: hepatic congestion, diffuse
   peritoneal infection/inflammation.  Peritioneal signs difficult to
   assess in this profoundly neutropenic pt with a limited inflammatory
   response.  Presumed source of GNR bacteremia is translocation across
   gut
CT abdomen negative for obvious perf, but cannot r/o microperf.
   - follow up final CT reads on multiple studies
   - low threshold for re-imaging with changes in clinical situation
   - follow up pending cultures
   - continue abx as below & ID c/s for question of double-covering GNRs
   in setting of PCN allergy
   - fluid resuscitation as below given extensive third spacing into
   abdomen
   - surgery following
   # Febrile Neutropenia / GNR bacterimia:  ANC is currently 60
profoundly
   neutropenic.  Unclear if GNR bacteremia is secondary to GI process
   which facilitated translocation across gut
will be clearer once GNR
   speciated and when we can determine if this is polymicrobial which
   would strongly argue for GI source.  Previously on double-GNR covg with
   aztreonam and CIPRO, but now off Cipro as it has rarely been implicated
   in case studies as a cause of hepatitis. ID consulting on other options
   vs restarting Cipro.
   - CURRENT ABX: Vanco ([**6-20**]-), Aztreonam ([**6-20**]-), Flagyl ([**6-20**]-),
   Micafungin ([**6-21**]-), Cipro ([**Date range (1) 6206**])
   - ?plan for G-CSF, check in w BMT
   - stool assays pending
   - serial chest x-rays
   - culture if spikes; f/u blood cultures
   - trend fever curve
   - Acyclovir 400mg TID
need to d/w BMT re: acyclovir vs gancyclovir
   (more hepatotoxic)
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Question of VOD [**3-2**] chemotherapy effect, vs
   hepatitis vs diffuse abdominal infection vs CMV. Lack of elevated alk
   phos argues against a ductal obstruction, pt has no gallbladder.
   - liver service consulted regarding further diagnosis and mgt
   - d/w surgery and rads re: best study to evaluate for VOD; given how
   poor liver US was for biliary eval, likely we would not get good
   dopplers
   - no intervention currently
   - exercise caution with benzos, etc given progressive hepatic
   impairment.
   # Tachypnea: Pt with suppressed tdal volumes secondary to abdominal
   distension and thus compensating with increase in RR. Concern is that
   he may tire if this persist or worsens.  Do not believe that pain
   contributing got tachypnea as pt denies. Will monitor closely.
   -ABG this AM
   - Consider a-line although complicated in this pt with such prononunced
   thrombocytopenia.
   # Fluid Resuscitation/ Tachycardia: Likely intravascularly depleted
   given rapidity of third spacing into abdomen.  Given increased work of
   breathing and ongoing infxn, tachycardia may not resolve with
   hydration.  Will bolus with goal of maintaining UOP. Would use levophed
   as pressor, avoid vasopressin and neo for effects on mesenteric
   circulation.
   - 2L NS thia AM and re-assess
   # APML: Holding ATRA, will discus further mgt of AML w/ BMT.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to profound marrow
   suppression from therapy. Transfuse to keep platelets > 20K per BMT
   recs.  Refractory to Plt transfusions
 getting HLA matching of plts b/c
   may have anti-plt Ab. Need to f/u on this issue with blood bank.
   # Anemia: Impossible to tell whether pt is hemolyzing as LDH may be
   elevated from bowel process. Hapto useless as s/p multiple

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has recently undergone chemotherapy. He was admitted to the bone marrow transplant (BMT) service with febrile neutropenia, GNR bacteremia, and recent diarrhea. The patient now presents with progressive hepatic failure, marked abdominal distension, respiratory failure, pancytopenia, bacteremia, acute pain, and neutropenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal pain and distension: The patient has a distended abdomen, which could be due to several processes such as hepatic congestion, diffuse peritoneal infection/inflammation, or bowel/mesenteric edema. This may lead to further respiratory compromise and potential complications like bowel ischemia or perforation.
2. Febrile neutropenia/GNR bacteremia: The patient is profoundly neutropenic with an ANC of 60. He has GNR bacteremia, which could be secondary to a gastrointestinal process facilitating translocation across the gut. Monitoring for sepsis and considering appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, which could be due to various causes like VOD post-chemotherapy, hepatitis, diffuse abdominal infection, or CMV infection. Close monitoring of liver enzymes and consulting the liver service for further diagnosis and management is important.
4. Tachypnea: The patient's increased"

   49-year-old M with a history of APML s/p multiple rounds of
   chemotherapy who recently underwent MIDAM chemotherapy and was admitted
   to the BMT service with febrile neutropenia, GNR bacteremia, and recent
   diarrhea.  Progressive hepatic failure over 3 days is now appearing to
   improve, but still with a markedly distended abdomen which has
   compromised his respiratory status and required intubation.
   # Abdominal distension [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema: Progressive since
   admission and ultimately requiring intubation for subsequent resp
   compromise.  No clear ascites or excess bowel gas seen on images. Seems
   to be almost entirely bowel/mesenteric edema which could fit with
   several processes: hepatic congestion, diffuse peritoneal
   infection/inflammation, CMV.  Peritioneal signs impossible to assess
   [**3-2**] sedation and neutropenia.  Presumed source of GNR bacteremia is
   translocation across gut p.vulgaris fits with this; bacterial
   peritonitis also possible
CT abdomen negative for obvious perf, but
   cannot r/o microperf.
   - low threshold for re-imaging with changes in clinical situation
   - follow up pending cultures; possible that this is poly-microbial
   - continue abx as below & consider double-covering GNRs if worsens
   - fluid resuscitation as below given extensive third spacing into
   abdomen; keep UOP above 60
   - surgery following
   - Cont tx dose of acyclovir and f/u CMV viral load.
   # Febrile Neutropenia / GNR bacterimia:  ANC is currently 60
profoundly
   neutropenic.  Likely GNR bacteremia is secondary to GI process which
   facilitated translocation across gut.  Could be polymicrobial which
   would strongly argue for GI source; currently growing only
   pan-sensitive p.vulgaris.  S/p meropenem desensitization.
   - CURRENT ABX: Vanco ([**6-20**]-), Meropenem ([**6-23**]-), Flagyl ([**6-20**]-),

   - culture if spikes; f/u blood cultures
   - trend fever curve
   - Acyclovir Tx dose, f/u CMV and HSV studies
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Possiblities include VOD [**3-2**] chemotherapy effect
   (reported complication of myelotarg), vs hepatitis [**3-2**] chemo vs diffuse
   abdominal infection vs CMV. Lack of elevated alk phos argues against a
   ductal obstruction.  Not pursuing MR of Liver to dx VOD as this would
   not affect mgt currently and all liver marker improving as of this
   AM
if worsens, would pursue MR.
   - VIT K given as per Liver consult
   - monitor liver labs (esp synthetic function) [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider hepatic impairment for dosing of meds
   # Vent status: Pt intubated for increased work of breathing from
   abdominal distension.  Would not expect resp status to improve until
   abd distension is improved; this is the principal barrier to
   extubation.  Blood gas this AM adequate
no vent adjustments necessary.
   Pt does not have ARDS, but is already on ARDSnet volumes.
   # Fluid Resuscitation/ Tachycardia: 7 L positive yesterday. Prone to
   third spacing into abdomen, but currently s/p adequate volume
   repletion.  Will bolus with goal of maintaining UOP>60. Pt currently
   not displaying septic physiology, but if necessary, ould use levophed
   as pressor, avoid vasopressin and neo for effects on mesenteric
   circulation.
   - 1L NS this AM and re-assess
   # Renal failure: Cr trending up despite copious volume repletion.  Will
   monitor closely given acyclovir.  Degree of liver dz not sufficient to
   produce hepatorenal syndrome.
   # APML: Holding ATRA, will discus further mgt of AML w/ BMT.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to profound marrow
   suppression from therapy. Transfuse to keep platelets > 20K per BMT
   recs.  Refractory to Plt transfusions
 getting HLA matching of plts b/c
   may have anti-plt Ab. Need to f/u on this issue with blood bank.
   - check CBC/DIC labs q6h; plt goal is 50, Hct goal is 25 per BMT.
   # Anemia: Impossible to tell whether pt is hemolyzing as LDH may be
   elevated from bowel process. Hapto useless as s/p multiple
   transfusions. Bili elevated [**3-2**] hepatic process.  Will trend CBC q6H.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who recently underwent chemotherapy and was admitted to the bone marrow transplant (BMT) service with febrile neutropenia, GNR bacteremia, and recent diarrhea. He has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure (not ARDS), pancytopenia, bacteremia, neutropenia, acute pain, and hepatic failure. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory compromise due to abdominal distension caused by bowel/mesenteric edema. He also has an anal fissure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of febrile neutropenia and GNR bacteremia, indicating a high risk of infection. Given his immunocompromised state and invasive lines, there is a potential for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and catheter-related urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
2. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's markedly distended abdomen and compromised respiratory status suggest the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome. This condition can lead to increased intra-abdominal pressure, impairing respiratory function and causing organ dysfunction.
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's hepatic failure may be due to various causes such as chemotherapy-induced liver damage, viral hepatitis, diffuse abdominal infection, or CMV infection. Close monitoring of liver"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure secondary to severe pancreatitis and sepsis caused by Proteus vulgaris. The patient required mechanical ventilation and had an endotracheal tube placed.

On admission, the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic, with a blood culture positive for P. vulgaris. He received broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem), antifungal therapy (micafungin), and antiviral therapy (acyclovir). The patient also received blood products due to pancytopenia with a platelet count of 18.

Overnight, the patient's condition remained stable with no acute events or changes in management. His vital signs included a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/87 mmHg to 126/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results showed leukopenia with a white blood cell count below 0.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 18, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin, low albumin, elevated lactate, and elevated LDH levels"

 ACUTE PAIN
   49-year-old M with a history of APML s/p multiple rounds of
   chemotherapy who recently underwent MIDAM chemotherapy and was admitted
   to the BMT service with febrile neutropenia, GNR bacteremia, and recent
   diarrhea.  Progressive hepatic failure over 3 days is now appearing to
   improve, but still with a markedly distended abdomen which has
   compromised his respiratory status and required intubation.
   # Abdominal distension [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema: Progressive since
   admission and ultimately requiring intubation for subsequent resp
   compromise.  No clear ascites or excess bowel gas seen on images. Seems
   to be almost entirely bowel/mesenteric edema which could fit with
   several processes: hepatic congestion, diffuse peritoneal
   infection/inflammation, CMV.  Peritioneal signs impossible to assess
   [**3-2**] sedation and neutropenia.  Presumed source of GNR bacteremia is
   translocation across gut p.vulgaris fits with this; bacterial
   peritonitis also possible
CT abdomen negative for obvious perf, but
   cannot r/o microperf.
   - low threshold for re-imaging with changes in clinical situation
   - follow up pending cultures; spoke to micro: only one organism seenl
   - continue abx as below & consider double-covering GNRs if worsens
   - fluid resuscitation as below given extensive third spacing into
   abdomen; keep UOP above 60
   - surgery following
   # Febrile Neutropenia / GNR bacterimia:  ANC is currently 60
profoundly
   neutropenic.  Likely GNR bacteremia is secondary to GI process which
   facilitated translocation across gut.  Currently growing only
   pan-sensitive p.vulgaris.  S/p meropenem desensitization.

   - Dose of acyclovir changed to ppx dose; f/u CMV viral load.
   - will bronch and BAL given persistent low grade fevers and

   .
   # Hepatic failure: Possiblities include VOD [**3-2**] chemotherapy effect
   (reported complication of myelotarg), vs hepatitis [**3-2**] chemo vs diffuse
   abdominal infection vs CMV. Lack of elevated alk phos argues against a
   ductal obstruction.  Not pursuing MR of Liver to dx VOD as this would
   not affect mgt currently and all liver marker improving as of this
   AM
if worsens, would pursue MR.
   - VIT K given as per Liver consult for elevated INR
   - monitor liver labs (esp synthetic function) [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider hepatic impairment for dosing of meds
   # Vent status: Pt intubated for increased work of breathing from
   abdominal distension.  Would not expect resp status to improve until
   abd distension is improved; this is the principal barrier to
   extubation.  Blood gas this AM adequate
no vent adjustments necessary.
   Pt does not have ARDS, but is already on ARDSnet volumes (6CC/KG)
   # Fluid Resuscitation/ Tachycardia: 7 L positive yesterday. Prone to
   third spacing into abdomen, but currently s/p adequate volume
   repletion.  Will bolus with goal of maintaining UOP>60. Pt currently
   not displaying septic physiology, but if necessary, ould use levophed
   as pressor, avoid vasopressin and neo for effects on mesenteric
   circulation.
   - Currently likely fluid overloaded and as he has not displayed septic
   physiology, will diurese.
   # Renal failure: Cr stable since yesterday.  Will monitor closely given
   acyclovir.  Degree of liver dz not sufficient to produce hepatorenal
   syndrome.
   # APML: Holding ATRA, will discus further mgt of AML w/ BMT.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to profound marrow
   suppression from therapy. Transfuse to keep platelets > 20K per BMT
   recs.  Inititally refractory to Plt transfusions
 negative plt Abs
   - check CBC/DIC labs q6h; plt goal is 50, Hct goal is 25 per BMT.
   # Anemia: Hemolysis unlikely as LDH trending down. Possible GI bleed vs
   RP bleed, but likely a contribution from impairment of production. Has
   only had one small guiaic positive stool.   Will trend CBC q6H.  Labs
   as above. Transfuse for hct<25.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the bone marrow transplant (BMT) service with febrile neutropenia, gram-negative bacilli (GNR) bacteremia, and recent diarrhea. He underwent midam chemotherapy and is currently experiencing hepatic failure, abdominal distension, respiratory failure, acute pain, pancytopenia, and neutropenia.

Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis: The patient is showing signs of hepatic failure, which can be caused by various factors such as VOD (veno-occlusive disease), chemotherapy effect, hepatitis, diffuse abdominal infection, or CMV (cytomegalovirus) infection.
2. Abdominal distension: The patient has a markedly distended abdomen, which is causing compromised respiratory status and required intubation. This could be due to bowel/mesenteric edema, hepatic congestion, diffuse peritoneal infection/inflammation, or CMV.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for increased work of breathing from abdominal distension. Improving the abdominal distension is crucial for improving respiratory status.
4. Febrile neutropenia: The patient has profound neutropenia and a fever, indicating febrile neutropenia. He is already on meropenem for GNR bacteremia.

   49-year-old M with a history of APML s/p multiple rounds of
   chemotherapy who recently underwent MIDAM chemotherapy and was admitted
   to the BMT service with febrile neutropenia, GNR bacteremia, and recent
   diarrhea.  Progressive hepatic failure over 3 days is now appearing to
   improve, but still with a markedly distended abdomen which has
   compromised his respiratory status and required intubation.
   # Abdominal distension [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema: Progressive since
   admission and ultimately requiring intubation for subsequent resp
   compromise.  No clear ascites or excess bowel gas seen on images. Seems
   to be almost entirely bowel/mesenteric edema which could fit with
   several processes: hepatic congestion, diffuse peritoneal
   infection/inflammation, CMV.  Peritioneal signs impossible to assess
   [**3-2**] sedation and neutropenia.  Presumed source of GNR bacteremia is
   translocation across gut p.vulgaris fits with this; bacterial
   peritonitis also possible
CT abdomen negative for obvious perf, but
   cannot r/o microperf.
   - low threshold for re-imaging with changes in clinical situation
   - follow up pending cultures; possible that this is poly-microbial
   - continue abx as below & consider double-covering GNRs if worsens
   - fluid resuscitation as below given extensive third spacing into
   abdomen; keep UOP above 60
   - surgery following
   - Cont tx dose of acyclovir and f/u CMV viral load.
   # Febrile Neutropenia / GNR bacterimia:  ANC is currently 60
profoundly
   neutropenic.  Likely GNR bacteremia is secondary to GI process which
   facilitated translocation across gut.  Could be polymicrobial which
   would strongly argue for GI source; currently growing only
   pan-sensitive p.vulgaris.  S/p meropenem desensitization.

   # Hepatic failure: Possiblities include VOD [**3-2**] chemotherapy effect
   (reported complication of myelotarg), vs hepatitis [**3-2**] chemo vs diffuse
   abdominal infection vs CMV. Lack of elevated alk phos argues against a
   ductal obstruction.  Not pursuing MR of Liver to dx VOD as this would
   not affect mgt currently and all liver marker improving as of this
   AM
if worsens, would pursue MR.
   - VIT K given as per Liver consult
   - monitor liver labs (esp synthetic function) [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider hepatic impairment for dosing of meds
   # Vent status: Pt intubated for increased work of breathing from
   abdominal distension.  Would not expect resp status to improve until
   abd distension is improved; this is the principal barrier to
   extubation.  Blood gas this AM adequate
no vent adjustments necessary.

   not displaying septic physiology, but if necessary, ould use levophed
   as pressor, avoid vasopressin and neo for effects on mesenteric
   circulation.
   - 1L NS this AM and re-assess
   # Renal failure: Cr trending up despite copious volume repletion.  Will
   monitor closely given acyclovir.  Degree of liver dz not sufficient to
   produce hepatorenal syndrome.
   # APML: Holding ATRA, will discus further mgt of AML w/ BMT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has recently undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and is currently admitted to the bone marrow transplant (BMT) service. The patient presented with febrile neutropenia, GNR bacteremia, and recent diarrhea. He has been progressing hepatic failure over the past three days, which appears to be improving, but he still has a markedly distended abdomen that has compromised his respiratory status and required intubation.

Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis: The patient is showing signs of hepatic failure, which could be due to various causes such as VOD (veno-occlusive disease) related to chemotherapy, hepatitis, diffuse abdominal infection, or CMV infection. However, the lack of elevated alkaline phosphatase (alk phos) argues against a ductal obstruction. The patient's liver markers are improving, so it is important to monitor them closely.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which is likely secondary to a gastrointestinal process that facilitated bacterial translocation across the gut. This bacteremia is being treated with meropenem.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, characterized by low platelet count, low white blood cell count, and low red blood cell count. This is most likely secondary to profound marrow suppression from therapy. Platelet transfusion is recommended to"

   49-year-old M with a history of APML admitted for severe abdominal
   distention resulting in respiratory failure. Slowly improving with
   sypportive care.
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to abdominal distention and increased
   work of breathing. Doing well on AC.
   - Resolve abdominal distention
   # Abdominal distension [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema: no clear surgical
   management.  Not worsening
   GNR bacteremia (translocation) vs. microperforation
   - low threshold for re-imaging with changes in clinical situation
   - follow up pending cultures; spoke to micro: only one organism seen
   - continue abx as below & consider double-covering GNRs if worsens
   - fluid resuscitation as below given extensive third spacing into
   abdomen; keep UOP above 60
   - surgery following
   # Febrile Neutropenia / GNR bacterimia:  ANC is currently 60
profoundly
   neutropenic.  Likely GNR bacteremia is secondary to GI process which
   facilitated translocation across gut.  Currently growing only
   pan-sensitive p.vulgaris.  S/p meropenem desensitization.  Bronch
   unrevealing

   Post: Cipro ([**Date range (1) 6206**]) Aztreonam ([**Date range (1) 6272**]) Flagyl ([**Date range (1) 6291**])
   - GCSF per BMT
   - serial chest x-rays; concern for atelectasis vs early infx process in
   RLL on Abd CT
   - culture if spikes; f/u blood cultures
   - trend fever curve
   - Dose of acyclovir changed to ppx dose; f/u CMV viral load
   # Hepatic failure: Possiblities include VOD [**3-2**] chemotherapy effect
   (reported complication of myelotarg), vs hepatitis [**3-2**] chemo vs diffuse
   abdominal infection vs CMV. Lack of elevated alk phos argues against a
   ductal obstruction.  Not pursuing MR of Liver to dx VOD as this would
   not affect mgt currently and all liver marker improving as of this
   AM
if worsens, would pursue MR.
   - VIT K IV Daily ongoing given elevated INR
   - monitor liver labs (esp synthetic function) [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider hepatic impairment for dosing of meds
   # Renal failure: Cr stable since yesterday.  Will monitor closely given
   acyclovir.  Degree of liver dz not sufficient to produce hepatorenal
   syndrome.
   # APML: Holding ATRA, will discus further mgt of AML w/ BMT.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to profound marrow
   suppression from therapy. Transfuse to keep platelets > 20K per BMT
   recs.  Inititally refractory to Plt transfusions
 negative plt Abs
   - check CBC/DIC labs q6h; plt goal is 50, Hct goal is 25 per BMT.
   # Anemia: Hemolysis unlikely as LDH trending down. Possible GI bleed vs
   RP bleed, but likely a contribution from impairment of production. Has
   only had one small guiaic positive stool.   Will trend CBC q6H.  Labs

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) who was admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been slowly improving with supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. It is crucial to continue providing appropriate respiratory support and monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Abdominal Distension and Diffuse Bowel Edema: The patient has diffuse bowel edema with no clear surgical management. Continuous monitoring is required to assess any worsening of abdominal distension. If there are changes in the clinical situation, follow-up imaging with re-imaging should be considered.

3. Febrile Neutropenia and GNR Bacteremia: The patient is profoundly neutropenic and has bacteremia likely caused by Gram-Negative Rods (GNRs). This could be a result of translocation across the gut facilitated by a GI process. The patient is currently growing only pan-sensitive Pseudomonas vulgaris. The current antibiotic regimen includes vancomycin, meropenem, and micafungin. Post-discharge, ciprofloxacin, aztreonam, and Flagyl have been added. G-CSF has been prescribed per BMT, and serial chest x-rays should be performed"

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) admitted to the ICU for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has been experiencing febrile neutropenia and GNR bacteremia, likely secondary to gastrointestinal (GI) process facilitating translocation across the gut. The patient has been growing pan-sensitive Pseudomonas vulgaris, and meropenem desensitization has been performed. 

The patient also has hepatic failure, with possible causes including VOD, chemotherapy effect, hepatitis, diffuse abdominal infection, or CMV. The lack of elevated alkaline phosphatase argues against a ductal obstruction. 

Renal failure is present, with creatinine stable since yesterday. The patient's thrombocytopenia is most likely secondary to profound marrow suppression from therapy. 

The patient has anemia, likely due to impaired production rather than hemolysis. Anal fissure is also noted, and the patient is being treated with analpram at home. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition via a nasogastric tube, glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures including deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including pneumonia, hepatitis, pancreatitis, respiratory failure, leukemia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and acute pain. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but they have a fever of 101.7°F. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging and microbiology tests are pending. The patient is receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, metronidazole, acyclovir, meropenem, vancomycin, furosemide, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever and neutropenia, there is a risk of developing sepsis due to an infection.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and elevated plateau pressure may indicate a risk for ARDS.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, a decline in brain function due to severe liver disease.
4. Bleeding: The patient's pancy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. The patient has been slowly improving with supportive care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. It is important to resolve the abdominal distention to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Abdominal Distension: The patient has diffuse bowel edema, which could be due to GNR bacteremia (translocation) or microperforation. Close monitoring and follow-up pending cultures are necessary.
3. Febrile Neutropenia/GNR Bacteremia: The patient has febrile neutropenia with GNR bacteremia. Treatment includes meropenem desensitization, and ongoing antibiotic therapy. Administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is planned.
4. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving from an initial insult possibly related to ATRA. Close monitoring of liver labs and administration of vitamin K IV daily is recommended.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is improving with lasix administration. The goal is to maintain a daily fluid output of 1-2 liters.
6. APML: The patient's ATRA is being held, and further management of acute my"

   obtain KUB to evaluate for stool and prescribe bowel regimen.  Also,
   patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. He has been slowly improving with supportive care. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 113/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's abdomen is still distended and tympanic, although softer over the past 24 hours. Fluid analysis shows a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.1%, platelet count of 50 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe abdominal distention has led to respiratory failure. It is important to continue providing supportive care and address the underlying cause of the distention.

2. Abdominal Distension: The patient's abdomen remains distended, indicating ongoing bowel edema. This could be due to GNR bacteremia or microperforation. Further evaluation and management are needed to resolve the abdominal distention.

   Assessment and Plan
   49-year-old M with a history of APML admitted for severe abdominal
   distention resulting in respiratory failure. Slowly improving with
   supportive care. He continued to be febrile overnight.
   # Febrile Neutropenia / GNR bacterimia:  ANC is currently 20.  P.
   Vulgaris & E. Coli bacteremia, concern for VRE given his overall
   clinical picture.  Linezolid and Flagyl started overnight.
   - CURRENT ABX: Vanco ([**6-20**]-), Meropenem ([**6-23**]-), Micafungin ([**6-21**]-)
   Flagyl ([**Date range (1) 6291**], [**6-27**]-), Linezolid ([**6-28**]- /// Post: Cipro ([**Date range (1) 6206**])
   Aztreonam ([**Date range (1) 6272**])
   - GCSF per BMT
   - culture if spikes; f/u blood cultures
   - trend fever curve
   # Pancolitis:Abdominal distension [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema: no clear
   surgical management.  Softer today. Etiology GNR bacteremia
   (translocation) vs. microperforation.  UOP remains stable.  Not
   stooling, and yet concern for C. diff has been raised.  Lasix gtt could
   not start yesterday due to line access issues that have been resolved.
   - follow up pending cultures
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1 followed by gtt, goal -1-2L
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to abdominal distention and increased
   work of breathing. Doing well on AC.
   - Resolve abdominal distention
   # APML: Holding ATRA, will discus further mgt of AML w/ BMT.  Required
   only 1 unit of platelets overnight
   - check CBC/DIC labs q6h; plt goal is 30, Hct goal is 25 per BMT
   # Renal failure: Cr continues to improve with lasix administration.
   - Goal -1-2L daily
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs continue to improve from initial insult which
   was like ATRA related.
   - monitor liver labs daily

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) who was admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. He has been slowly improving with supportive care but continues to be febrile.

The patient has been diagnosed with febrile neutropenia due to GNR bacteremia, and he has been started on antibiotics including Flagyl and Linezolid. His current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, micafungin, and aztreonam.

The patient also has pancolitis with diffuse bowel edema, and there is concern for Clostridium difficile infection. Lasix has been ordered to manage his fluid balance and renal failure.

The patient is on assisted ventilation for respiratory failure secondary to abdominal distention. His APML management will be discussed further with the bone marrow transplant team.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and an abnormal coagulation profile. Imaging studies reveal a new opacity in the right lung apex, which could be due to an extrapleural hematoma, loculated pleural fluid, or dense consolidation or atelectasis in the right upper lobe.

The patient's plan includes monitoring blood cultures, following up with pending cultures, administering Lasix for fluid management, and adjusting medication doses as needed based on laboratory results."

   # Pancolitis:Abdominal distension [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema: no clear
   surgical management.  Softer today. Etiology GNR bacteremia
   (translocation) vs. microperforation.  UOP remains stable.  Not
   stooling, and yet concern for C. diff has been raised.  Lasix gtt could
   not start yesterday due to line access issues that have been resolved.
   - follow up pending cultures
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1 followed by gtt, goal -1-2L
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to abdominal distention and increased
   work of breathing. Doing well on AC.
   - Resolve abdominal distention
   # APML: Holding ATRA, will discus further mgt of AML w/ BMT.  Required
   only 1 unit of platelets overnight
   - check CBC/DIC labs q6h; plt goal is 30, Hct goal is 25 per BMT
   # Renal failure: Cr continues to improve with lasix administration.
   - Goal -1-2L daily
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs continue to improve from initial insult which
   was like ATRA related.
   - monitor liver labs daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted to the ICU for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and sedated, unresponsive to painful stimuli. He has been febrile overnight and is currently receiving treatment for febrile neutropenia/Gram-negative bacteremia. The patient's abdominal distention has improved slightly, but he remains at risk for complications such as pancreatitis, colitis, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to the abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. His renal function continues to improve with Lasix administration, and hepatic function is showing improvement from an initial insult likely related to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment for APML. The patient's platelet count is low, and he requires close monitoring of liver labs and complete blood count/disseminated intravascular coagulation (CBC/DIC) labs every 6 hours. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition support through peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN), glycemic control, arterial and peripheral intravenous lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been improving slowly with supportive care. He remains febrile overnight.

Medical Complications:
1. Febrile Neutropenia/GNR Bacteremia: The patient has an ANC of 20 and presents with fever, suggesting febrile neutropenia. There is concern for VRE bacteremia given the clinical picture. Linezolid and Flagyl were started overnight.
2. Pancolitis/Abdominal Distension: The patient has diffuse bowel edema without clear surgical management. Etiology is GNR bacteremia (translocation) vs. microperforation. The patient's UOP remains stable, and there is concern for Clostridium difficile infection.
3. Respiratory Failure: Secondary to abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. The patient is doing well on assisted ventilation.
4. APML: The patient is holding ATRA and will discuss further management of AML with BMT. The patient required only one unit of platelets overnight.
5. Renal Failure: Creatinine continues to improve with Lasix administration.
6. Hepatic Failure: LFTs continue to improve from the initial insult, which was likely ATRA-related.

   # Febrile Neutropenia / GNR bacterimia:  ANC is currently 80.  P.
   Vulgaris & E. Coli bacteremia, with some concern for VRE given his
   overall clinical picture per BMT but no culture data to support this.
   Linezolid and Flagyl started per BMT and pt currently on both Vanco and

   - discuss discontinuation of linezolid with BMT; Vanco providing
   adequate gram + covg and cultures growing two species which are being
   appropriately treated with meropenem
   - GCSF per BMT
   - culture if spikes; f/u blood cultures
   - trend fever curve
   # Pancolitis / Mesenteric Edema: Abdominal distension [**3-2**] diffuse bowel
   edema: no clear surgical management and pt not a good candidate for OR
   given current counts. Etiology GNR bacteremia (translocation) vs.
   microperforation.  UOP remains stable.  Not stooling, but concern for
   C. diff has been raised.  Lasix 40mg IV bolus has produced good UOP.
   Pancreatitis now known to be positive, had not been checked since LFTs
   had been improving, but by adding-on to previous labs, we can see that
   it began to trend up as his LFTs trended down.
   - follow up pending cultures
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1 followed by repeat doses, goal -1-2L per day as BP
   tolerates
   - if persistently febrile, will get CT torso to eval for drainable
   fluid collection; hold off on abd imaging for now; trend pancreatic
   markers
   - bowel sounds now present, may attempt TFs, will d/w BMT
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to abdominal distention and increased
   work of breathing. Doing well on AC.
   - Goal is to resolve abdominal distention as above
   # APML: Holding ATRA, will discus further mgt of AML w/ BMT.  Requiring
   1 u of platelets per day approximately (recently)
   - check CBC/DIC labs q6h; plt goal is 30, Hct goal is 25 per BMT
   # Renal failure: Cr continues to improve with lasix administration.
   - Goal -1-2L daily
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs continue to improve from initial insult which
   may have been chemo (possibly myelotarg) related.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. The patient is currently improving with supportive care, but continues to be intermittently febrile and has elevated lipase levels indicating pancreatic inflammation.

Medical Complications:
1. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient has neutropenia with an ANC of 80 and bacteremia caused by P. vulgaris and E. coli. He is currently on meropenem, vancomycin, metronidazole, and micafungin.
2. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has pancolitis/mesenteric edema with diffuse bowel edema. There is concern for Clostridium difficile infection, and the patient is being treated with Lasix to maintain urine output.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. He is doing well on assisted ventilation.
4. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels indicating pancreatic inflammation.
5. Hepatic Failure: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, but they are improving from an initial insult that may have been chemotherapy-related.
6. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease with improving creatinine levels.

   49-year-old M with a history of APML admitted for severe abdominal
   distention resulting in respiratory failure. Slowly improving with
   supportive care. He continues to be intermittently febrile and lipase
   now revealing pancreatic inflammation which was not noted previously.
   # Febrile Neutropenia / GNR bacterimia:  ANC is currently 80.  P.
   Vulgaris & E. Coli bacteremia, with some concern for VRE given his
   overall clinical picture per BMT but no culture data to support this.
   Linezolid and Flagyl started per BMT and pt currently on both Vanco and
   linezolid
   - CURRENT ABX: Vanco ([**6-20**]-), Meropenem ([**6-23**]-), Micafungin ([**6-21**]-)
   Flagyl ([**Date range (1) 6291**], [**6-27**]-), Linezolid ([**6-28**]- /// Post: Cipro ([**Date range (1) 6206**])
   Aztreonam ([**Date range (1) 6272**])
   - discuss discontinuation of linezolid with BMT; Vanco providing
   adequate gram + covg and cultures growing two species which are being
   appropriately treated with meropenem
   - GCSF per BMT
   - culture if spikes; f/u blood cultures
   - trend fever curve
   # Pancolitis / Mesenteric Edema: Abdominal distension [**3-2**] diffuse bowel
   edema: no clear surgical management and pt not a good candidate for OR
   given current counts. Etiology GNR bacteremia (translocation) vs.
   microperforation.  UOP remains stable.  Not stooling, but concern for
   C. diff has been raised.  Lasix 40mg IV bolus has produced good UOP.
   Pancreatitis now known to be positive, had not been checked since LFTs
   had been improving, but by adding-on to previous labs, we can see that
   it began to trend up as his LFTs trended down.
   - follow up pending cultures
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1 followed by repeat doses, goal -1-2L per day as BP
   tolerates
   - if persistently febrile, will get CT torso to eval for drainable
   fluid collection; hold off on abd imaging for now; trend pancreatic
   markers
   - bowel sounds now present, may attempt TFs, will d/w BMT
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to abdominal distention and increased
   work of breathing. Doing well on AC.
   - Goal is to resolve abdominal distention as above
   # APML: Holding ATRA, will discus further mgt of AML w/ BMT.  Requiring
   1 u of platelets per day approximately (recently)
   - check CBC/DIC labs q6h; plt goal is 30, Hct goal is 25 per BMT
   # Renal failure: Cr continues to improve with lasix administration.
   - Goal -1-2L daily
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs continue to improve from initial insult which
   may have been chemo (possibly myelotarg) related.
   - monitor liver labs daily

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. The patient has been slowly improving with supportive care but continues to be intermittently febrile and has now revealed pancreatic inflammation.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient is febrile and neutropenic with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL. He is currently on meropenem, vancomycin, flagyl, and micafungin for febrile neutropenia and GNR bacteremia.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has recently developed pancreatic inflammation, as indicated by elevated lipase levels. This could potentially lead to further complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure secondary to abdominal distention. While currently stable on assisted ventilation, there is a risk of deterioration if the underlying cause (abdominal distention) is not adequately managed.

4. Hepatic Failure: The patient has improved liver function tests, indicating initial hepatic injury, possibly related to chemotherapy or other factors. Continued monitoring of liver labs is essential to detect any potential hepatic failure.

5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have shown improvement with lasix administration. Close monitoring of"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and sedated.
- The patient has been intermittently febrile and has elevated lipase levels indicating pancreatic inflammation.
- He has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, bacteremia caused by Proteus vulgaris and E. coli, and hepatic failure.
- The patient is also experiencing renal failure and pancytopenia.
- He has a history of APML and is currently being held off on ATRA treatment.
- His current medications include N-acetylcysteine (NAC), meropenem, micafungin, and Flagyl.
- The patient's abdominal distention is attributed to either GNR bacteremia (translocation) or microperforation. He is being treated with antibiotics and bowel rest with total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- His respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. He has had fluctuations in mechanical ventilation modes but is currently on pressure control ventilation (PCV) with assist.
- The patient's renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 1.2.
- His liver function tests (LFTs) have been improving,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted to the ICU for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with assisted spontaneous breathing mode (CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow) and receiving multiple intravenous medications, including antibiotics and antifungals. The patient has neutropenia and bacteremia with Pseudomonas vulgaris and Escherichia coli, but no growth in fungal cultures. He also has elevated liver enzymes and lipase, indicating possible pancreatitis. The patient's renal function is slightly impaired, and his hepatic function is improving from an initial insult, possibly related to chemotherapy. His blood counts are being monitored, and he requires frequent platelet transfusions. The patient's abdominal distention is attributed to pancolitis and mesenteric edema, with unclear etiology, and there are concerns about Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to the abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. His current condition is stable, and he is being managed with supportive care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and secondary to the abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. Close monitoring of peak pressures and weaning off mechanical ventilation will be important to prevent further complications.

2. Infection: The patient has neutropenia and bacteremia with Pseudomonas"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. He has been slowly improving with supportive care but continues to have intermittent fevers and evidence of pancreatic inflammation.

Potential medical complications:
1. Febrile neutropenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count (ANC 95) and is febrile, indicating a risk for febrile neutropenia. This condition requires prompt antibiotic treatment.
2. GNR bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GNR), specifically Proteus vulgaris and E. coli. This requires continued antibiotic therapy.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest pneumonia, which needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics.
4. Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating hepatitis. Further evaluation and management are required.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels, indicating acute pancreatitis. Monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and supportive care are necessary.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. Resolution of abdominal distention is crucial to improve respiratory function.
7. Leukemia: The patient has APML, and ongoing management with chemotherapy and supportive care is essential.
8. Pancytopenia: The patient has low platelet and red blood"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. The patient has been slowly improving with supportive care.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Febrile Neutropenia/GNR Bacteremia: The patient has been febrile and neutropenic with a confirmed GNR bacteremia. This requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Pancolitis/Mesenteric Edema: The patient has diffuse bowel edema, which can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation. Close monitoring of the patient's symptoms and abdominal imaging may be necessary.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels, indicating possible pancreatitis. Monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and supportive care may be required.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. Continued optimization of mechanical ventilation settings and resolution of abdominal distention are crucial.

5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, including diuretics, may be necessary.

6. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function tests have improved but still show abnormalities. Monitoring of liver enzymes and supportive care are important.

7. APML: The patient requires close monitoring of"

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. He has been slowly improving with supportive care. The patient's medical history includes febrile neutropenia, gram-negative bacteremia, pancreatitis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hepatic failure, and APML.

The patient's current medications include meropenem, micafungin, linezolid, pantoprazole, and TPN without lipids. He is also receiving glycerol control and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), liver enzymes (ALT/AST), amylase, lipase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate. The urine analysis reveals bacteria few, red blood cells (RBC), proteins (Prot), and white blood cells (WBC).

The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray and a CT scan of the torso. His vital signs include temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's physical examination findings include intubation and sedation, clear lungs bilaterally, regular rapid heart rate, tightly dist"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU receiving supportive care and has shown slow improvement. The patient has multiple medical complications including febrile neutropenia, GNR bacteremia, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, hepatic failure, pancytopenia, and acute pain. He is being treated with a combination of antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient has a history of neutropenia and is currently febrile. This condition can lead to severe infections due to the compromised immune system.
2. GNR Bacteremia: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis and requires prompt antibiotic treatment.
3. Pancreatitis: The elevated lipase levels suggest pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and uremia.
5. Hepatic Failure: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, indicating hepatic failure. This can result in jaundice, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, peritonitis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, hepatic failure, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and acute pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has shown signs of infection with pneumonia and peritonitis. The presence of fever, leukopenia, and positive cultures suggest ongoing bacterial infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the patient's response to treatment should be monitored closely.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention and increased work of breathing. This has resulted in an increased peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), requiring mode changes on the ventilator. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the current management strategy and determine the appropriate timing for weaning from mechanical ventilation.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and daily kidney function is essential. Diuretic therapy may be required to manage fluid overload and maintain a negative fluid balance.

4. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have improved from an initial insult, which may have been related to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted for severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been slowly improving with supportive care.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Peritonitis (non-SBP): The patient has signs of peritonitis, which is inflammation of the peritoneum, the lining of the abdomen. This may be due to an infection.

2. Pneumonia, other: The patient has worsening consolidation in the bilateral lower lobes of the lungs, which may indicate pneumonia or atelectasis (collapsed lung). A mini-BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) was negative for gram stain, making it less likely that the consolidation is due to bacterial pneumonia.

3. Hepatitis, other: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), indicating liver injury or inflammation. This could be caused by various factors such as medications, infections, or underlying liver disease.

4. Bacteremia: The patient has been found to have bacteremia, specifically with Proteus vulgaris and E. coli. He is currently being treated with meropenem.

5. Pancreatitis, acute: Although the patient's pancreas appears normal on the recent CT torso, the elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest the possibility of acute pancreatitis.

   distention in the setting of chemotherapy. Slowly improving with
   supportive care.
   # GNR bacteremia:  Neutropenia resolved as of [**7-1**]. P. Vulgaris & E.
   Coli bacteremia, with some concern for VRE per BMT but no culture data
   to support this.  s/p Vanco ([**Date range (1) 6409**]), s/p Metronidazole ([**Date range (1) 6291**],
   [**Date range (1) 6410**]), s/p Micafungin ([**2201-7-1**]).
   - CURRENT ABX: Meropenem ([**6-23**]-), Linezolid ([**6-28**]- ),
   - also on Voriconazole ([**2201-7-1**]-) and acyclovir
   - GCSF per BMT
   - trend fever curve
   - monitor ANC
   - ID recs
   - BMT recs
   # Fevers: Unclear etiology: infection (PNA, C.diff) vs atelectasis vs
   drug fever vs other. CT torso demonstrates worsened consolidation
   infiltrate vs. atelectasis. Mini-BAL negative gram stain therefore less
   likely PNA. Monitor closely for diarrhea to suggest C. diff (negative
   x2). Negative B-glucan and Aspergillus.
   - Increase PEEP to 10 for atelectasis
   - continue antimicrobials as above
   - continue checking blood cultures when spikes
   - check C. diff #3
   # Pancolitis / Mesenteric Edema : Possibly [**3-2**] chemo, resulting in GNR
   bacteremia (translocation) vs. microperforation.  Abdominal distension
   [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema. Repeat CT torso unable to comment on bowel
   edema as bowel wall collapsed, however does comment on increase of
   ascites. On exam patient is anasarcic.
   - abx as above for 2 week course
   - bowel rest with TPN for nutrition
   - lasix 40 mg IV, goal -1.5 L
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to abdominal distention and increased
   work of breathing. Currently on assist control.
   - goal is to resolve abdominal distention as above
   - monitor peak pressure
   - increase peep to 10 for atelactasis
   - wean midazolam
   # Acute Renal failure: Baeline Cr in the 1.3-1.5 range
   - Goal even to slightly negative today, hold diuresis today.
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs continue to improve from initial insult which
   may have been chemo (possibly myelotarg) related.
   - monitor liver labs daily
   # Pancreatitis: Pancreas normal according to recent CT torso.
   - follow labs
   # APML: Holding ATRA. Requiring PLTs frequently. WBC starting to
   increase.
   - plt goal is >30, Hct goal is >25 per BMT

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. The patient is intubated and sedated, with clear lungs bilaterally, regular heart rhythm, and good peripheral pulses. The patient has a tightly distended abdomen with minimal bowel sounds present.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C), blood pressure ranging from 120/71 mmHg to 154/90 mmHg, heart rate between 100 and 126 beats per minute, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count ranging from 1.0 to 1.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count ranging from 28 to 33 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels at 159 and 153 units, respectively. Other lab values indicate acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine level of 1.3-1.5 mg/dL and hepatic failure with improved liver function tests.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention. The patient has been improving with supportive care but still requires close monitoring and management of several medical complications.

1. Potential Medical Complications:
   a. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention. The goal is to resolve this by relieving the abdominal distention and providing supportive care.
   b. GNR Bacteremia: The patient had neutropenia but has since resolved. He developed bacteremia with P. Vulgaris and E. Coli, with some concern for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Appropriate antibiotics have been administered, and blood cultures are being monitored.
   c. Atelectasis: The patient has worsening consolidation in both lower lobes, which could be due to atelectasis. Increased PEEP has been implemented to address this issue.
   d. C. Difficile Infection: The patient has tested negative for C. Diff twice but will have a third test due to ongoing fevers.
   e. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function continues to improve.
   f. Hepatic Failure/Pancreatitis: The patient's liver function tests are improving from an initial insult that may have been related to chemotherapy.

   - monitor ANC
   - ID recs
   - BMT recs
   # Fevers: Unclear etiology: infection (PNA, C.diff) vs atelectasis vs
   drug fever vs other immune reconstitution with incresing WBC. Mini-BAL
   negative gram stain and PMNs therefore unlikely PNA. No skin ulcers on
   exam. Negative B-glucan and Aspergillus. C. Diff negative X 2.
   - Increase PEEP to 10 for atelectasis
   - continue antimicrobials as above
   - continue checking blood cultures when spikes
   - check C. diff #3
   # Pancolitis / Mesenteric Edema : Possibly [**3-2**] chemo, resulting in GNR
   bacteremia (translocation) vs. microperforation.  Abdominal distension
   [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema. Repeat CT torso unable to comment on bowel
   edema due to significant ascites.
   - abx as above
   - bowel rest with TPN for nutrition
   - diuresis goal -2 L, lasix as needed
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to abdominal distention.
   - Attempt pressure support
   - goal is to resolve abdominal distention as above
   - continue to wean sedation
   # Acute Renal failure: Continues to improve.
   # Hepatic failure/Pancreatitis: LFTs continue to improve from initial
   insult which may have been chemo (possibly myelotarg) related.
   - monitor liver labs daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to severe abdominal distention. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include fevers, secondary hypertension, and tachycardia. He has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medications. His blood cultures are positive for Gram-negative rods, and there is concern for possible VRE bacteremia. The patient's neutropenia has resolved.

The patient's abdominal distention is thought to be caused by pancolitis/mesenteric edema, possibly due to recent chemotherapy or microperforation. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to the abdominal distention.

The patient's renal function is improving, and his hepatic function is also improving from an initial insult that may have been related to chemotherapy. The patient's white blood cell count is starting to increase.

The patient's current medications include meropenem, linezolid, voriconazole, acyclovir, midazolam, fentanyl, lasix, pantoprazole, and TPN without lipids. The patient has allergies to penicillins, hives, shortness of breath, ciprofloxacin, and hepatic toxicity. The last doses of antibiotics were given on 07/04/2201 at 11:30 PM (linezolid), 07/05/2201 at 12:15 AM (voriconazole), and 07/05/2201 at 12:48 AM (acyclovir).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.3°F, blood pressure ranging from 99-186 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 104-160 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight is currently 137.8 kg, and his height is 70 inches.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. His liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are elevated, as well as his amylase and lipase levels. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated. Other lab values, such as potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and albumin, are within normal ranges or slightly elevated.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include further respiratory failure if the abdominal distention worsens, infection due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy and the presence of an indwelling catheter, renal failure if fluid balance is not maintained properly, hepatic failure if liver function continues to deteriorate, and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted for respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention. The patient has been slowly improving with supportive care. He has neutropenia, which has resolved, and bacteremia caused by P. Vulgaris and E. coli, with some concern for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The patient has received vancomycin, metronidazole, and micafungin.

The patient's fevers are of unclear etiology, possibly due to infection (pneumonia or Clostridium difficile), atelectasis, drug fever, or other immune reconstitution with increasing white blood cell count. A mini-balloon bronchoscopy (mini-BAL) was negative for gram stain and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), making pneumonia unlikely. Blood cultures are being monitored when spikes occur, and a third test for Clostridium difficile is pending.

The patient also has pancolitis and mesenteric edema, possibly due to recent chemotherapy resulting in gram-negative bacterial bacteremia (translocation) or microperforation. There is significant ascites, making it difficult to comment on bowel edema. The patient is receiving antibiotics, bowel rest with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutrition, diuresis with lasix, and goal-directed fluid management.

The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention. Pressure support"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted with respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. The patient has several medical complications and ongoing assessments.

1. GNR Bacteremia: The patient previously had bacteremia caused by P. Vulgaris and E. coli, which was treated with antibiotics. There is concern for antibiotic resistance due to previous exposure to vancomycin and metronidazole.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention. The plan is to transition to propofol and attempt pressure support ventilation, aiming to resolve the abdominal distention.

3. Fevers: The patient has a temperature of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and the differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, atelectasis, drug fever, and immune reconstitution. Blood cultures are being checked when spikes occur, and C. difficile testing will be repeated.

4. Pancolitis/Mesenteric Edema: This could be related to recent chemotherapy causing GNR bacteremia (translocation) or microperforation. Antibiotics will be continued, and bowel rest with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutrition will be implemented.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving, with a stable creatinine level of 1.1.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure caused by severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. The patient has multiple medical complications and ongoing issues.

1. GNR Bacteremia: The patient had neutropenia which has resolved. He has bacteremia caused by P. Vulgaris and E. Coli, with concerns regarding previous antibiotic usage (Vanco, Metronidazole, Micafungin).

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: This is secondary to abdominal distension. The plan is to transition to Propofol and attempt pressure support ventilation, aiming to resolve the abdominal distention.

3. Fevers: The patient has a temperature of 101.8°F. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, C. Difficile infection, atelectasis, drug fever, and other immune reconstitution issues. Mini-BAL was negative for gram stain and PMNs, making pneumonia less likely. Negative beta-glucan and Aspergillus tests, along with two negative C. Difficile tests, have ruled out these possibilities. Increased PEEP to 10 for atelectasis and continued antimicrobials are recommended.

4. Pancolitis/Mesenteric Edema: This may be due to [**3-2**] chemotherapy resulting in GNR bacteremia (translocation) or microperforation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted with respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention. He has been slowly improving with supportive care. The patient has a history of neutropenia, which has resolved, and previous bacteremia with P. Vulgaris and E. coli, with some concern for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) per BMT but no culture data to support this. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungal medications.

Current medications include meropenem, linezolid, voriconazole, and acyclovir. The patient is also on pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to bowel rest.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GNR Bacteremia: The patient had bacteremia with P. Vulgaris and E. coli, and there is concern for VRE. He has been treated with vancomycin, metronidazole, and micafungin. Current antibiotics include meropenem.
2. Fevers: The patient has had intermittent fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes pneumonia (PNA), Clostridium difficile (C. Diff.), atelectasis, drug fever, and other immune reconstitution. Blood cultures are being monitored, and C. Diff. testing is ongoing.
3. Pancolitis/Mesenteric Edema: The patient's abdominal distention may be due to chemotherapy-induced pancolitis/mesenteric edema or microperforation. He is receiving bowel rest with TPN and diuretics.
4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention. Pressure support is being attempted, and weaning sedation is ongoing.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function continues to improve, with creatinine now stable at 1.1.
6. Hepatic Failure/Pancreatitis: Liver function tests are improving from the initial insult, which may have been chemotherapy-related.
7. APML: The patient is holding ATRA and requiring frequent platelet transfusions. White blood cell counts are starting to increase.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and previous bacteremia indicate an increased risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may recur if abdominal distention persists or worsens. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory effort is necessary.
3. Acute kidney injury: Although the patient's renal function is currently stable, continued monitoring of renal parameters and fluid balance is crucial.
4. Hepatic failure: While the liver function tests are improving, ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes and bilirubin is necessary.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been improving slowly with supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR bacteremia: The patient had bacteremia caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR) including P. Vulgaris and E. coli. He has been treated with vancomycin, metronidazole, and micafungin.
2. Fevers: The patient continues to have fevers of unclear etiology. Possible causes include infection (pneumonia, Clostridium difficile), atelectasis, drug fever, or immune reconstitution with increasing white blood cell count. Blood cultures have been sent, and C. difficile testing will be repeated.
3. Pancolitis/Mesenteric Edema: The patient may have pancolitis or mesenteric edema possibly due to recent chemotherapy resulting in GNR bacteremia or microperforation. The abdominal distension is caused by diffuse bowel edema.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to abdominal distention. Pressure support and continued weaning of sedation are planned to resolve the abdominal distention.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient continues to improve from acute renal failure, with creatinine now stable at 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute myeloid leukemia (APML) who was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to severe abdominal distention. The patient has a history of chemotherapy, which may have contributed to his condition. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including:
1. GNR Bacteremia: The patient initially had neutropenia, but it has resolved. He has been found to have bacteremia caused by P. Vulgaris and E. coli. There is concern about antibiotic resistance due to previous antibiotic use (Vanco, Metronidazole, Micafungin).
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: This is secondary to abdominal distension. The patient's respiratory support will be transitioned to Propofol and weaning down as tolerated. A paracentesis may be considered to relieve the abdominal distension.
3. Fevers: The patient has a temperature of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia (PNA), Clostridium difficile (C. Diff.), atelectasis, drug fever, or immune reconstitution. Mini-BAL was negative for gram stain and PMNs, making pneumonia unlikely. Other tests have also ruled out C. Diff. and fungal infections.
4. Pancolitis/Mesenteric Edema: This may be related to recent chemotherapy, resulting in GNR bacteremia (translocation"

The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted with respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention. He has been treated with chemotherapy and has developed several complications.

1. GNR Bacteremia: The patient initially had bacteremia caused by Neutropenia, which has since resolved. He now has bacteremia due to Proteus vulgaris and E. coli, and has been treated with vancomycin, linezolid, metronidazole, and micafungin.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by abdominal distension. He is being weaned off propofol and pressure support is being attempted. Paracentesis is being considered, and daily chest X-rays are being monitored.

3. Fevers: The patient's fevers are being evaluated for various causes including pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, atelectasis, drug fever, immune reconstitution, and others. A mini-balloon lavage was negative for gram stain and PMNs, making pneumonia less likely. Negative beta-glucan and Aspergillus tests, along with three negative C. Diff tests, have ruled out these conditions.

4. Pancolitis/Mesenteric Edema: The patient may have pancolitis or mesenteric edema, possibly"

   Assessment and Plan
   49M w APML admitted w respiratory failure from severe abdominal
   distention in the setting of chemotherapy on [**2201-6-12**].
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: likely [**3-2**] abdominal
   inflammation/distension, improving.
   - wean fentanyl and propofol as tolerated
   - decrease PEEP to 5, switch to pressure support and perform SBT
   - monitor daily CXR
   # Fevers: DDx includes: infection (PNA, C.Diff) vs atelectasis vs drug
   fever vs clot vs other. WBC counts returning. Mini-BAL negative gram
   stain and PMNs therefore unlikely PNA. No skin ulcers on exam. Negative
   B-glucan and Aspergillus. C. Diff negative X 3.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx
   - Consider d/c lines if continues to spike
   - U/S for DVT evaluation
   # GNR Bacteremia: Neutropenia resolved as of [**7-1**]. Proteus vulgaris & E
   coli bacteremia, s/p Vanco ([**Date range (1) 6409**]), s/p Linezolid ([**Date range (1) 6527**]), s/p
   Metronidazole ([**Date range (1) 6291**], [**Date range (1) 6410**]), s/p Micafungin (stopped [**7-1**]).

   - voriconazole ([**7-1**]-)
   - acyclovir
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Pancolitis / Mesenteric Edema : Possibly [**3-2**] chemo, resulting in GNR
   bacteremia (translocation) vs. microperforation.  Abdominal distension
   [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema. Repeat CT torso unable to comment on bowel
   edema due to significant ascites.
   - abx as above
   - bowel rest with TPN for nutrition
   - diuresis goal -1-2L, lasix as needed
   # Acute Renal failure: Continues to improve, Cr now stable at ~1.0
   - monitor daily Cr
   # Hepatic failure/Pancreatitis: Likely [**3-2**] drug toxicity from chemo
   (?myelotarg). Transaminases in 4000s on presentation, continue to
   improve.
   - monitor liver labs daily
   # APML: Last chemo [**6-12**]. Requiring PLTs frequently. WBC starting to
   increase.
   - plt goal is >30, Hct goal is >25 per BMT
   - BMT recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. He has a history of APML and was admitted with respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes fevers, GNR bacteremia, pancolitis/mesenteric edema, acute renal failure, and hepatic failure/pancreatitis. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal treatment, and antiviral medication. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has ongoing fevers and a history of GNR bacteremia. There is a risk of developing further infections, such as pneumonia or central line-associated bloodstream infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which may recur if there is continued abdominal inflammation or distention.
3. Abdominal complications: The patient has evidence of pancolitis and mesenteric edema, which could lead to bowel ischemia or perforation.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which requires close monitoring of renal function.
5. Hepatic failure/pancreatitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted with respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention. He has a history of chemotherapy and presents with multiple medical complications. The patient's current medications include propofol, meropenem, linezolid, voriconazole, vancomycin, acyclovir, furosemide, pantoprazole, and TPN with lipids. His recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a fever, and his respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with pressures set at 550 mL Vt, 12 RR set, 10 cmH2O PEEP, and FiO2 of 40%. He has evidence of fluid overload on chest X-ray and is receiving diuretics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for continued dependence on respiratory support and potential complications associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Fevers: The patient has an ongoing fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, atelectasis, drug fever, immune reconstitution, and other causes. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause of the fever.

   Assessment and Plan
   49M w APML admitted w respiratory failure from severe abdominal
   distention in the setting of chemotherapy on [**2201-6-12**].
   #Acute Respiratory Failure: likely [**3-2**] abdominal distension, improving.
   - wean fentanyl and propofol as tolerated
   - decrease PEEP to 5, switch to pressure support and perform SBT
   - monitor daily CXR
   # GNR Bacteremia: Neutropenia resolved as of [**7-1**]. Proteus vulgaris & E
   coli bacteremia, s/p Vanco ([**Date range (1) 6409**]), s/p Linezolid ([**Date range (1) 6527**]), s/p
   Metronidazole ([**Date range (1) 6291**], [**Date range (1) 6410**]), s/p Micafungin (stopped [**7-1**]).
   - current abx: Meropenem ([**6-23**]-), Vancomycin ([**7-5**]-)
   - voriconazole ([**7-1**]-)
   - acyclovir
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Fevers: DDx includes: PNA, C.Diff., atelectasis, drug fever, immune
   reconstitution, vs other. WBC counts returning. Mini-BAL negative gram
   stain and PMNs therefore unlikely PNA. No skin ulcers on exam. Negative
   B-glucan and Aspergillus. C. Diff negative X 3.
   - Increased PEEP to 10 for atelectasis
   - Continue broad spectrum abx
   - Consider d/c lines if continues to spike
   - U/S for DVT
   -
   # Pancolitis / Mesenteric Edema : Possibly [**3-2**] chemo, resulting in GNR
   bacteremia (translocation) vs. microperforation.  Abdominal distension
   [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema. Repeat CT torso unable to comment on bowel
   edema due to significant ascites.
   - abx as above
   - bowel rest with TPN for nutrition
   - diuresis goal -1-2L, lasix as needed
   # Acute Renal failure: Continues to improve, Cr now stable at ~1.0
   - monitor daily Cr
   # Hepatic failure/Pancreatitis: Likely [**3-2**] drug toxicity from chemo
   (?myelotarg). Transaminases in 4000s on presentation, continue to
   improve.
   - monitor liver labs daily
   # APML: Last chemo [**6-12**]. Requiring PLTs frequently. WBC starting to
   increase.
   - plt goal is >30, Hct goal is >25 per BMT
   - BMT recs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted with respiratory failure secondary to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. The patient has a history of neutropenia that has resolved, and he is currently experiencing fevers of unknown origin. The differential diagnosis for the fevers includes pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, atelectasis, drug fever, immune reconstitution, and other causes. Mini-balloon lavage (mini-BAL) was negative for gram stain and PMNs, making pneumonia less likely. Negative beta-glucan and Aspergillus tests, along with a negative C. diff toxin assay, further support the possibility of drug fever or other causes.

The patient's abdominal distention is believed to be caused by either chemotherapy-induced pancreatitis or mesenteric edema resulting from GNR bacteremia. There is also evidence of acute renal failure, hepatic failure, and pancreatitis, which are thought to be related to drug toxicity from chemotherapy.

The patient's current plan includes weaning off propofol and fentanyl, decreasing PEEP to 5, switching to pressure support, and performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Daily chest X-rays will be monitored. Antibiotic therapy will continue with meropenem, vancomycin, and acyclovir. The patient's immune reconstitution will be followed, and recommendations from the bone marrow transplant team"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute respiratory failure, likely due to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. He was admitted with pancreatitis and acute renal failure. He is pancytopenic from chemotherapy and has a history of GNR bacteremia. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, bowel rest, and TPN for nutrition. His renal function is improving, but he is volume overloaded and being diuresed gently. The patient's liver enzymes are in the thousands and are improving. His blood counts are starting to come back, but he still requires frequent platelet transfusions. The patient is on multiple medications including propofol, fentanyl, meropenem, vancomycin, voriconazole, and acyclovir.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected GNR bacteremia and continues to spike fevers. There is a possibility of developing further infections due to his immunocompromised state and indwelling lines.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he develops pneumonia or if his abdominal distention recurs.
3. Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal function is improving, there is still a risk of further deterioration if fluid overload is not managed appropriately.
4. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver enzymes are still elevated, indicating potential ongoing liver damage or toxicity from chemotherapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   49M w APML admitted w respiratory failure from severe abdominal
   distention in the setting of chemotherapy on [**2201-6-12**].
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: likely [**3-2**] abdominal
   inflammation/distension, improving.
   - wean fentanyl and propofol as tolerated
   - decrease PEEP to 5, switch to pressure support and perform SBT
   - monitor daily CXR
   # Fevers: DDx includes: infection (PNA, C.Diff) vs atelectasis vs drug
   fever vs clot vs other. WBC counts returning. Mini-BAL negative gram
   stain and PMNs therefore unlikely PNA. No skin ulcers on exam. Negative
   B-glucan and Aspergillus. C. Diff negative X 3. UE U/S demonstrated
   clots in the left arm.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx (see below)
   - Consider d/c lines if continues to spike
   - New line placement today
   - d/c old (likely infected) arterial line
   # DVT: LUE showed DVT.
   - heparin gtt

   - diuresis goal net negative, lasix as needed
   # Acute Renal failure: Continues to improve, Cr now stable at ~1.0
   - monitor daily Cr
   # Hepatic failure/Pancreatitis: Likely [**3-2**] drug toxicity from chemo
   (?myelotarg). Transaminases in 4000s on presentation, continue to
   improve.
   - monitor liver labs daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including neutropenia, bacteremia caused by Gram-negative bacteria, acute respiratory failure secondary to abdominal distension, fevers with an undiagnosed source, pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should monitor for any signs of infection and adjust the ventilator settings accordingly.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): Given the presence of multiple central lines, there is a risk of developing a bloodstream infection. Regular monitoring of line insertions, dressings, and cultures is essential to prevent and identify CRBSI early.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots. The patient is already on prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention, but close monitoring and frequent assessment for signs of clot formation are necessary.
4. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's fevers and bacteremia indicate an"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted for respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention. He received chemotherapy on [**2201-6-12**].

Current medical complications include:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His vital signs show tachycardia (HR: 121 bpm) and elevated respiratory rate (RR: 27 insp/min). Oxygen saturation is maintained at 96%. The patient's ABG results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH of 7.51 and high PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 242. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) are being performed, and tracheostomy is considered if SBT fails. Weaning of fentanyl and propofol is planned as tolerated.
2. Fevers: The patient has had intermittent fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes infection (pneumonia, GNR bacteremia), atelectasis, clot, drug fever (possibly voriconazole), or other causes. The mini-BAL was negative for gram stain and PMNs, making pneumonia less likely. Negative B-glucan and Aspergillus tests, along with an absence of skin ulcers, also rule out these infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   49M w APML admitted w respiratory failure from severe abdominal
   distention in the setting of chemotherapy on [**2201-6-12**].
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: likely [**3-2**] abdominal
   inflammation/distension. Difficult to wean sedation due to agitation (?
   withdrawal)
   - continue to attempt weaning fentanyl and propofol as tolerated
   - transition to dexmedotimidine
   - wean pressure support as tolerated and perform SBT daily
   - tracheostomy today
   - monitor daily CXR
   # Fevers: DDx includes: infection (PNA, GNR bacteremia) vs atelectasis
   vs clot vs drug fever (?voriconazole) vs other. WBC counts returning.
   Mini-BAL negative gram stain and PMNs therefore unlikely PNA. No skin
   ulcers on exam. Negative B-glucan and Aspergillus. C. Diff negative X

   - continue broad spectrum abx, but d/w ID/BMT
   - pan-cx (bl, urine)
   # GNR Bacteremia: Neutropenia resolved as of [**7-1**]. Proteus vulgaris & E
   coli bacteremia.

   - voriconazole ([**7-1**]-)
   - acyclovir
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u BMT recs
   # LUE DVT: Shown in left basilic vein on U/S [**7-7**].
   - heparin gtt, holding for tracheostomy
   # Pancolitis / Mesenteric Edema : Possibly [**3-2**] chemo, resulting in GNR
   bacteremia (translocation) vs. microperforation.  Abdominal distension
   [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema. Moderate ascites.
   - abx as above
   - tube feeds through OG tube (on hold today for tracheostomy)
   - diuresis goal net negative, lasix as needed
   - GI c/s
   - discuss PEG placement w GI given ascites
   # Hepatic failure/Pancreatitis: Likely [**3-2**] drug toxicity from chemo
   (?myelotarg). Transaminases in 4000s on presentation, continue to
   improve.
   - monitor liver labs daily
   # Acute Renal failure: Resolved. Cr now stable at ~1.0
   - monitor daily Cr
   # APML: Last chemo [**6-12**]. Requiring PLTs frequently. WBC starting to
   increase.
   - plt goal is >30, Hct goal is >25 per BMT

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident
s note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize
   and add the following points:
   49yo s/p chole with AML (M3) Dx in [**6-5**] s/p induction, consolidation
   and maintenance, though with need for additional consolidation doses of
   chemo due to progression, with recent chemo early [**2201-6-12**] with ATRA,
   mitoxantrone, myelotarg and gemtuzumab. Pt admit [**6-20**] with fever and 3
   days diarrhea; found to have progressive abd distention and pain. CT
   Abd consistent with bowel wall stranding and noted to have GNR
   (proteus) in blood. Also with acute hepatitis with transaminases close
   to 4000. Concern of viral process (CMV colitis/hepatitis) vs drug
   toxicity from recent chemo.
   Overnight, had CT scan that showed essentially normal lungs but abdomen
   reveals continued inflammation in the jejunum and duodenum.

   ill with following issues
   1)      Acute Respiratory Failure: Review of CT of lung is unimpressive
   so unclear why patient is still have difficulty weaning from the
   ventilator.
   - Will change to precedex and attempt weaning today
   2) Small bowel inflammation: GI consult, make surgery aware as already
   following patient
   3)Fever: Continues to spike temperature
   a.       Unclear if related to abdominal findings or another
   undiscovered source.  Will explore abdominal source for now and discuss
   with GI
   4)Renal- Continue diuresis to help get off the ventilator
   5)      Heme- pancytopenic [**3-2**] chemo. + counts continuing to improve

   Patient is Critically Ill
 time spent: 30 minutes
   Addedum: Failed weaning but will continue on precedex and make another
   attempt tomorrow.  If he fails, then we will plan for trach on Monday.
   Also, will hold heparin overnight and perform paracentesis to evaluate
   if fluid is source of persistent fever.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention.
- The patient has been receiving chemotherapy and has had recent treatment with ATRA, mitoxantrone, myelotarg, and gemtuzumab.
- The patient presented with fever, diarrhea, progressive abdominal distention, and pain.
- A CT scan showed bowel wall stranding and the presence of Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the blood.
- The patient also had acute hepatitis with elevated transaminases.
- Overnight, a CT scan revealed continued inflammation in the jejunum and duodenum.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.6, blood pressure in the 80s, and pulse in the 80s.
- The patient remains critically ill with multiple ongoing issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator despite a review of the CT scan showing unimpressive findings. The cause for this respiratory failure is unclear.
2. Small Bowel Inflammation: The patient has ongoing small bowel inflammation, and a GI consult has been made. Surgery is already following the patient.
3. Fever: The patient continues to spike temperatures, and it is unclear if this is related to the abdominal findings or another undiscovered source"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy.
- He was admitted with a diagnosis of APML (acute promyelocytic leukemia) and respiratory failure.
- The patient's fevers are being evaluated for differentials including infection, atelectasis, clot, drug fever, and other causes.
- A mini-BAL was negative for gram stain and PMNs, indicating an unlikely pneumonia.
- Blood cultures showed GNR bacteremia, which has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient has a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- He has a history of pancreatitis and hepatic failure, possibly due to drug toxicity from chemotherapy.
- His renal function is improving.
- The patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and requires frequent platelet transfusions due to his leukemia.
- The family wants to be present during weaning of sedation and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).
- The patient's wife has been updated on his status, and full code status has been discussed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fevers may indicate an ongoing infection. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, bacteremia, and other sources of infection. Continued monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and imaging studies will be important to identify and treat any potential infections.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted with respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a history of severe abdominal distention, which could be causing respiratory failure. The plan is to wean fentanyl and propofol as tolerated, provide pressure support, perform spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) daily, consider tracheostomy if SBT fails, and monitor daily chest X-ray.

2. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes infection (pneumonia or GNR bacteremia), atelectasis, clot, drug fever (possibly voriconazole), or other causes. The mini-balloon negative gram stain and PMNs indicate an unlikely pneumonia. No skin ulcers are present on examination, and negative B-glucan and Aspergillus make invasive fungal infection less likely. C. Diff negative X 3. A clot in the left arm was demonstrated on ultrasound. The plan is to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, perform pan-culture (blood and urine), consider re-imaging torso, and consult ID/BMT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted with respiratory failure from severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The cause is likely severe abdominal inflammation/distension. Weaning of sedation is difficult due to agitation, possibly withdrawal.

2. Fevers: The patient has spiking fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes infection (pneumonia, GNR bacteremia), atelectasis, clot, drug fever (voriconazole), or other causes. Mini-BAL was negative for infection, and the patient has been treated with multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics.

3. GNR Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with Proteus vulgaris and E. coli. He has been treated with vancomycin, linezolid, metronidazole, and currently with meropenem.

4. Left Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has clots in the left arm, and heparin has been initiated.

5. Pancolitis/Mesenteric Edema: The patient has diffuse bowel edema and moderate ascites. This may be due to chemotherapy-induced bowel inflammation or microperforation.

   Assessment and Plan
   49M w APML admitted w respiratory failure from severe abdominal
   distention in the setting of chemotherapy on [**2201-6-12**].
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: likely [**3-2**] abdominal
   inflammation/distension. Difficult to wean sedation due to agitation (?
   Withdrawal)
   - continue to attempt weaning fentanyl and propofol as tolerated
   - start dexmedotimidine
   - pressure support and perform SBT daily
   - consider tracheostomy if failed SBT
   - monitor daily CXR
   # Fevers: DDx includes: infection (PNA, GNR bacteremia) vs atelectasis
   vs clot vs drug fever (?voriconazole) vs other. WBC counts returning.
   Mini-BAL negative gram stain and PMNs therefore unlikely PNA. No skin
   ulcers on exam. Negative B-glucan and Aspergillus. C. Diff negative X
   3. UE. U/S demonstrated clots in the left arm.
   - continue broad spectrum abx, but d/w ID/BMT
   - pan-cx (bl, urine)
   - consider re-imaging torso
   # LUE DVT: Shown in left basilic vein on U/S [**7-7**].
   - heparin gtt
   # GNR Bacteremia: Neutropenia resolved as of [**7-1**]. Proteus vulgaris & E
   coli bacteremia, s/p Vanco ([**Date range (1) 6409**]), s/p Linezolid ([**Date range (1) 6527**]), s/p
   Metronidazole ([**Date range (1) 6291**], [**Date range (1) 6410**]), s/p Micafungin (stopped [**7-1**]).
   - current abx: Meropenem ([**6-23**]-), Vancomycin ([**7-5**]-)
   - voriconazole ([**7-1**]-)
   - acyclovir
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Pancolitis / Mesenteric Edema : Possibly [**3-2**] chemo, resulting in GNR
   bacteremia (translocation) vs. microperforation.  Abdominal distension
   [**3-2**] diffuse bowel edema. Repeat CT torso unable to comment on bowel
   edema due to significant ascites. Has been on TPN.
   - abx as above
   - start feeding through OG tube
   - diuresis goal net negative, lasix as needed
   # Acute Renal failure: Continues to improve, Cr now stable at ~1.0
   - monitor daily Cr
   # Hepatic failure/Pancreatitis: Likely [**3-2**] drug toxicity from chemo
   (?myelotarg). Transaminases in 4000s on presentation, continue to
   improve.
   - monitor liver labs daily
   # APML: Last chemo [**6-12**]. Requiring PLTs frequently. WBC starting to
   increase.
   - plt goal is >30, Hct goal is >25 per BMT

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute respiratory failure from severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. He has a history of APML and has undergone chemotherapy. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been experiencing spiking fevers, and his white blood cell count is elevated. He has a GNR bacteremia, which has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has evidence of a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis and acute renal failure. His liver enzymes are significantly elevated, suggesting possible hepatic failure or drug toxicity from chemotherapy. The patient's condition is stable, and he is being monitored closely with daily lab tests and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's spiking fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. Further diagnostic tests, such as cultures and imaging studies, should be performed to identify the source of infection and guide appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed left upper extremity DVT. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin should be continued, and measures to prevent further thrombotic events should be implemented.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted with respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention. He has undergone prolonged intubation and is now extubated. The patient's current concerns include acute respiratory failure, abdominal distention/mesenteric edema/ascites, fevers, GNR bacteremia, left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hepatitis/pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and APML.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and prolonged intubation. There is a risk of reintubation or tracheostomy if his respiratory status worsens.
2. Abdominal Distention/Mesenteric Edema/Ascites: The patient has moderate ascites of unclear etiology, possibly related to mesenteric edema. There is a risk of bowel ischemia or perforation due to the abdominal distention.

   # Acute Respiratory Failure: likely [**3-2**] abdominal
   inflammation/distension. Difficult to wean sedation due to agitation (?
   withdrawal)
   - continue to attempt weaning fentanyl and propofol as tolerated
   - transition to dexmedotimidine
   - wean pressure support as tolerated and perform SBT daily
   - tracheostomy today
   - monitor daily CXR
   # Fevers: DDx includes: infection (PNA, GNR bacteremia) vs atelectasis
   vs clot vs drug fever (?voriconazole) vs other. WBC counts returning.
   Mini-BAL negative gram stain and PMNs therefore unlikely PNA. No skin
   ulcers on exam. Negative B-glucan and Aspergillus. C. Diff negative X

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to severe abdominal inflammation/distension. He has a history of acute myeloid leukemia (APML) and has received chemotherapy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. There are concerns for possible infections, including pneumonia and bacteremia, as well as complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and hepatic failure/pancreatitis due to drug toxicity. The patient's renal function has improved, but he still requires close monitoring. His nutritional support includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has bibasilar consolidations on CT scan, which could represent atelectasis or pneumonia. Daily chest X-rays should be performed to monitor for any worsening of lung infiltrates.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of GNR bacteremia, and his neutropenia has resolved. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics as per ID/BMT recommendations and follow up with them for further guidance.
3. DVT: The patient has clots in the left arm, and a Doppler ultrasound confirmed a left upper extremity DVT. Heparin therapy should be initiated and continued until the tracheostomy is performed.
4. Hepatic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions, including prolonged intubation, tracheostomy, and extubation. The patient's medical history includes acute myeloid leukemia (APML), hepatic failure, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and GNR bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has persistent pulmonary consolidations, which may represent atelectasis or superimposed pneumonia. Monitoring respiratory status and daily chest X-rays are recommended.
2. Fevers: The patient's fevers may be due to infection, atelectasis, clot, drug fever, or other causes. Further evaluation is needed, including ABGs, daily CXR, and culture results.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of left upper extremity DVT. Heparin gtt is prescribed, and the tracheostomy is being held.
4. Mesenteric Edema: The patient has moderate intra-abdominal ascites and diffuse bowel edema. This may be related to chemotherapy-induced mesenteric edema or translocation of GNR bacteremia. Antibiotics, tube feeds through OG tube, diuresis, and GI cultures are recommended.
5. Hepatic Failure/Pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of drug toxicity"

   Assessment and Plan
   49M w APML admitted w respiratory failure from severe abdominal
   distention in the setting of chemotherapy on [**2201-6-12**].
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: likely [**3-2**] abdominal
   inflammation/distension in the setting of chemo. Prolonged intubation
   from [**6-20**] to [**7-11**], now extubated.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - monitor ABGs
   - consider diuresis to help w respiratory status (responds to lasix
   10mg IV)
   - goal -500-1000cc per 24 hrs
   - consider reintubation/tracheostomy if worsening
   - check CXR in AM
   # Abd distention/Mesenteric Edema/Ascites : Unclear etiology, likely
   diffuse inflammatory edema in the setting of chemo, possibly c/b GNR
   bacteremia (translocation) vs. microperforation. ? Bowel thickening on
   CT abdomen ? [**3-2**] edema, though could be infectious per GI. Moderate
   ascites of unclear etiology possibly related to mesenteric edema though
   ddx includes portal HTN given chemo-induced hepatitis on admission vs
   hypoalbuminemia vs other.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted with respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention.
- He has been intubated for an extended period and is now extubated.
- The patient has multiple medical complications, including abdominal distention/mesenteric edema/ascites, fevers of unknown origin, GNR bacteremia, left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hepatitis/pancreatitis, and acute renal failure.
- His current medications include broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin), diuretics for fluid management, and anticoagulation for the DVT.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal white blood cell count, and kidney function.
- Imaging studies reveal pulmonary consolidations, small bilateral pleural effusions, and mild jejunal wall thickening.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various organ systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary consolidations may progress to pneumonia, especially considering his immunocompromised state.
2. Sepsis: Given the presence of fevers and GNR bacteremia, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's recent improvement in renal function should be closely monitored to prevent a recurrence of acute kidney injury"

   -1 liter (responds to lasix 10mg IV)
   - consider reintubation/tracheostomy if worses
   # Abd distention/Ascites : Unclear etiology, likely initally from
   chemo, possibly c/b GNR bacteremia (translocation) vs.
   microperforation. ? Bowel thickening on CT abdomen. Moderate ascites of
   unclear etiology possibly related to fluid overload, though ddx
   includes portal HTN given chemo-induced hepatitis on admission vs

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. He was intubated from June 20th to July 11th and is now extubated. The patient has a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) and has received chemotherapy. He has multiple medical complications including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, peritonitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, pancreatitis, bacteremia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, tachycardia, acute pain, and leukemia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 157/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, as well as elevated liver enzymes and kidney function. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. The plan includes monitoring respiratory status, ABGs, and diuresis to help with respiratory status. Paracentesis is planned to evaluate for ascites, and further diagnostic tests such as KUB, stool culture, and O&P are recommended. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU."

     * apml
   Continues to do well from resp standpoint point post-extubation
   yesterday now tolerating minimal sup O2 and even RA. Remains delirius
   but clearer in thinking today. Agree with plan to continue to monitor
   respiratory status closely. Continue to diurese gently with lasix for
   neg fluid bal. Continues to have low-grade fevers--?  related to abd
   findings, SBP (unlikely given broad antibx), vs other inf source,
   atelecatasis, APML, or clot (on heparin). Continue broad antibx--will
   discuss with ID and BMT regarding length of this course, given ongoing
   bowel inflammation on imaging. GI is following.  Stool studies
   pending.  GI considering pursuing EGD with small bowel enteroscopy
   given low grade fevers. In terms of moderate ascitis on ct-cxs pending
   from dx tap.  Appeared serosangenous and transudative with high # rbcs,
   not enough to send cytology.  Will f/u cx's.   Hep gtt for UE dvt (from
   picc line which is now out). Consider starting coumadin in near future
   (though would hold as may pursue GI bx and place picc).  Start low dose
   anti-htn (metoprolol) if sys remain > 160.  In terms of nutrition, did
   not tolerate TFs yesterday.  Likely ileus. Will continue tpn for
   nutrition and obtain swallow study given prolonged intubation.
   ICU-full code, hep gtt, h2b, a-line, triple lumen ij--will ultimately
   need picc or midline.
   OOB to chair.  PT consult.

   - monitor respiratory status
   - monitor ABGs if status changes
   - gentle diuresis to help w respiratory status if needed, goal I/O of
   -1 liter (responds to lasix 10mg IV)
   - consider reintubation/tracheostomy if worses
   # Abd distention/Ascites : Unclear etiology, likely initally from
   chemo, possibly c/b GNR bacteremia (translocation) vs.
   microperforation. ? Bowel thickening on CT abdomen. Moderate ascites of
   unclear etiology possibly related to fluid overload, though ddx
   includes portal HTN given chemo-induced hepatitis on admission vs

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 49-year-old male with acute respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy.
- The patient was intubated from 6/20 to 7/11 and then extubated on 7/11.
- Chest X-ray showed atelectasis versus fluid in the left base.
- The patient's abdominal distention and ascites are of unclear etiology, possibly initially from chemotherapy, possibly due to GNR bacteremia (translocation) versus microperforation.
- A paracentesis showed transudative bloody fluid with no organisms on gram stain.
- The patient has fevers, with a differential diagnosis including infection (PNA, GNR bacteremia) versus atelectasis versus clot versus drug fever.
- The patient has clots in the left arm and has been started on heparin gtt.
- The patient's hypertension is elevated to 150s today, no clear hypertension history.
- The patient has GNR bacteremia, which has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient has acute renal failure, which has resolved, and his creatinine is now stable at ~1.0.
- The patient has hepatitis and pancreatitis, likely secondary to drug toxicity from chemotherapy.
- The patient has acute myeloid leukemia (APML) and is requiring platelets frequently. The patient's white blood cell count is starting to increase.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. The patient underwent prolonged intubation from June 20th to July 11th and was successfully extubated on July 11th.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to severe abdominal distention leading to respiratory failure. Although he was extubated on July 11th, his respiratory status should be closely monitored with regular monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABGs) if there are any changes.

2. Abdominal Distention/Ascites: The cause of the abdominal distention is unclear, but it may be related to chemotherapy-induced hepatitis, portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, or other factors. A paracentesis showed transudative bloody fluid with no organisms on gram stain. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

3. Fevers: The patient has had fevers with various differential diagnoses, including pneumonia, GNR bacteremia, atelectasis, clot, drug fever, and other possibilities. The mini-bal negative gram stain and PMNs make pneumonia less likely. No skin ulcers were observed on examination, and negative B-glucan and Aspergillus tests ruled out fungal infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted with respiratory failure from severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. The patient has undergone multiple interventions and treatments for various conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required prolonged intubation due to respiratory failure but was successfully extubated on day 11. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and ABGs is recommended.

2. Abdominal Distention/Ascites: The cause of the abdominal distention is unclear, but it may be related to chemotherapy-induced hepatitis, fluid overload, or hypoalbuminemia. The patient has moderate ascites of unclear etiology. Close monitoring of the abdomen and further evaluation of the ascites fluid are necessary.

3. Fevers: The patient's fevers may be due to various causes such as infection (pneumonia or GNR bacteremia), atelectasis, clot, drug fever, or other reasons. Mini-BAL negative gram stain suggests an unlikely case of pneumonia. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and follow-up paracentesis culture results are pending.

4. GNR Bacteremia: The patient had bacteremia caused by Proteus vulgaris and E. coli. He has been receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage, including vancomycin, linezolid, metronid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with acute respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. He was intubated for six days and extubated successfully. The patient is currently on room air and doing well. There is moderate ascites of unclear etiology, possibly related to fluid overload or portal hypertension. A paracentesis showed transudative bloody fluid with no organisms on gram stain. The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which has resolved. He also had a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) shown on ultrasound. The patient's neutropenia has resolved, and he is now afebrile. His last chemotherapy was on 6/12, and he requires frequent platelet transfusions. His white blood cell count is starting to increase.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the recent history of severe abdominal distention causing respiratory failure. If there are any changes in respiratory status, monitor ABGs and provide appropriate respiratory support if needed.

2. Abdominal Distention/Ascites: The etiology of the ascites is unclear, possibly related to fluid overload, portal hypertension, or other causes. Diuresis should be continued to help with respiratory status and achieve a goal of net negative fluid balance. Lasix can be used as needed. Further evaluation and management are required, including follow-up paracentesis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted with respiratory failure due to severe abdominal distention in the setting of chemotherapy. The patient underwent prolonged intubation from June 20th to July 11th and was subsequently extubated on July 11th.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure likely secondary to abdominal inflammation or distension in the setting of chemotherapy. The patient also has abdominal distention and ascites of unclear etiology, possibly related to fluid overload, chemotherapy-induced hepatitis, hypoalbuminemia, or other causes. A paracentesis showed transudative bloody fluid with no organisms on gram stain.

The patient is also experiencing fevers, with a differential diagnosis including infection (pneumonia, GNR bacteremia), atelectasis, clot, drug fever (possibly voriconazole), or other causes. Mini-BAL negative gram stain and PMNs indicate that pneumonia is unlikely. No skin ulcers were observed on examination, and negative B-glucan and Aspergillus tests were performed. C.
