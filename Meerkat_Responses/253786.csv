   Assessment and Plan
   53yo M with h/o HCV and DM2 admitted with hypovolemic shock requiring
   and diarrhea.
   .
   # Shock: hypovolemic shock from diarrhea, vomiting, and poor PO intake.
   If infectious/sepsis likely have GI source given GI symptoms. Does have
   hypoxia and PE considered but pt has a h/o COPD and may have long term
   hypoxia from this.
   - Aggressive IVF resuscitation with bicarb administration.
   - Follow up culture data. Negative cdiff.
   - If has further hypotension requiring pressors will need to replace
   central line but for now pressors have been weaned off and if continue
   to be off pressors will not need another line.
   - A-line if needs pressors again.
   .
   # AG and non-AG Metabolic Acidosis: With AG of 20 and change of bicarb
   of 11 on admission suggesting a mixed AG/non-AG metabolic acidosis.
   Likely the non-gap acidosis from diarrhea and gap acidosis from lactate
   (hypovolemic shock) and uremia.
   - Repeat ABG pending
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - 3 amps HCO3 in D5 this morning to replete bicarb with further dosing
   if necessary per PM labs.
   - Recheck in [**2-19**] hours
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely patient has baseline low O2 sats from COPD and likely
   chronic COPD.
   - Nebs standing and PRN
   - repeat CXR in am
   - weaning O2 as pt tolerates
   - Repeat ABG
   .
   # Gastroenteritis: Likely infectious given leukocytosis although other
   possibilities include mesenteric ischemia given report of GIB. Ischemic
   colitis unlikely given no inflammation seen on CT Abd. infectious
   etiologies include Hep A, vibrio, less likely giardia. Also at risk for
   Cdiff given PPI use but cdiff negative x 1.
   - f/u  Stool O+P, hepatits and viral serologies
   - NPO
   - Hepatitis serologies
   .
   # GIB: Unclear whether patient really has a GIB. From the OSH there is
   a report of BRBPR but from here only trace guaiac positive stools.
   - Active T+C
   - check PM hct
   - continue home PPI
   - GI consult if hcts drop given history of esophageal varices and
   higher risk of GIB given cirrhosis
   - Need to get records from [**Hospital3 5496**].
   .
   # Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-18**] shock or component of viral hepatitis.
   Patient already with HCV but per him has been treated and is in
   remission. Also started drinking again recently and may have
   ETOH-hepatitis although this is usually more cholestatic.
   - trend LFTs
   - Viral studies
   - RUQ U/S r/o portal venous thrombosis if other studies unrevealing
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. Likely [**12-18**] hypovolemia (prerenal)
   initially, now likely with ATN as well.
   - Liberal IVF
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - FeNa = 1.7%, no muddy brown casts
   - Monitor UOP, trend CK.
   .
   # ETOH: Drinking a significant amount of brandy daily and with history
   of shakes in last day from not drinking. Never withdrawl seizures
   before.
   - MVI, Thiamine, Folate
   - CIWA  w prn ativan (has not required since admission)-last drink on
   [**1-26**].
   - SW consult when healthy
   - Seizure precautions
   .
   # DM2: Diet controlled at baseline.
   - ISS
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   # h/o HTN: Now hypotensive
   - hold lisinopril for now
   .
   Prophylaxis: Boots given concern for GIB
   .
   Access: PICC to be placed today. As unlikely to need CVL, can d/c one
   placed at OSH later today.

   Communication:  Patient
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of HCV and DM2 admitted with hypovolemic shock requiring aggressive IVF resuscitation. The patient also has a history of COPD and presents with diarrhea, vomiting, and poor PO intake.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Shock: The patient is at risk for recurrent hypovolemic shock due to ongoing diarrhea, vomiting, and poor oral intake.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has mixed AG/non-AG metabolic acidosis, likely due to diarrhea (non-gap acidosis) and lactate production from hypovolemic shock (gap acidosis).

3. Hypoxia: The patient has chronic COPD, which may contribute to baseline low O2 saturation levels. The patient requires nebs and PRN oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation.

4. Gastroenteritis: The patient has leukocytosis, suggesting an infectious etiology for his gastrointestinal symptoms. However, further evaluation is needed to determine the specific pathogen causing the gastroenteritis.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's history of cirrhosis and esophageal varices puts him at higher risk for GIB. Active type and crossmatch have been ordered, and the patient is already on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

6. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of HCV, DM2, and alcohol use disorder. He was admitted with hypovolemic shock, diarrhea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. The patient's condition has been stabilized with aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and bicarbonate administration. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 123/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK level has significantly increased, indicating potential muscle breakdown. This can lead to kidney damage and acute kidney injury.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient is diagnosed with mixed AG/non-AG metabolic acidosis. It is important to monitor and correct electrolyte imbalances and address the underlying cause of the acidosis.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of COPD and may have chronic low O2 saturation. PE should also be considered, and the patient will require Nebulizer treatments and weaning off supplemental oxygen as tolerated.
4. Gastroenteritis: The patient has leukocytosis, suggesting an infectious etiology. Hepatitis serologies, stool cultures, and viral studies should be followed up to determine the cause of GIB.
5. Transaminitis: Elevated LFT"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided progress note. However, there are several important findings and interventions documented.

The patient's 24-hour events include an increase in creatine kinase (CK) levels from 376 to 1234 to 1585, which raises the suspicion of rhabdomyolysis. Urine myoglobin is pending. The patient's lactate levels have trended down with intravenous fluids (IVFs), and they are currently receiving normal saline (NS) and lactated Ringer's (LR) at 500cc/hr. The patient's urine output (UOP) is very low since admission, so they have been given 8L NS and 3L LR. A bicarb drip for metabolic acidosis has been started with a bicarb level of 11. The patient also experienced several episodes of coffee ground brown emesis starting at 7 PM, and serial hematocrits (HCTs) have been ordered along with a type and screen. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient has no known drug allergies, and their last dose of antibiotics was not mentioned. The patient is receiving several infusions and other medications, including omeprazole (Prilosec), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and IV PPI.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F),"

   delta gap-4
   Consistent with significant non-gap acidosis as well.
   Microbiology: C. Diff negative
   O+P pending
   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male admitted with hypovolemic shock in the setting of recent
   shellfish ingestion and with antecedent illness of wather diarrhea.  He
   has had reasonable response to initial volume support but now maintains
   persistent and significant metabolic acidosis with both gap and non-gap
   components.
   1)Shock
Hypovolemic.   He has had modest improvement in HCT and overall
   urine output but still remains with some peristent hypovolemia with
   continued positive fluid balance.
   -Will continue to bolus PRN
   -We have improved blood pressure stability
   -Will move to PICC today
   2)DIARRHEA-Patient with large volume watery diarrhea concerning for
   infectious source.  We have a broad differential with vibrio, hep A,
   cholera all possible to be contributing.  Salmonella/Shigella/E. coli
   must all be considered.
   -Follow up stool cultures and results
   -Based on large volume watery diarrhea will continue to control
   symptoms as vibrio/viral would appear most likely
   -If culture results seen or colonic source suspected will add empiric
   antibiotics
   3)RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-Likely pre-renal
   souce with ATN likely present as well.
   -Urine lytes
FeNA was 1.7%
   -No evidence of muddy brown casts seen
   -Will pursue renal consult if not resolving by today.
   4)Acidosis
He has had in large part resolution with lactic acidosis
   improving source.  The non-gap acidosis is likely in part attributable
   to diarrhea.  He has an HCO3- deficit of 5 mEq/l and will replace with
   100meq Hco3 this morning and look to recheck and continue replacement
   across the day.
   -3 amps HCO3 in D5 this morning
   -Recheck in [**2-19**] hours
   -Replace as needed for non-gap acidosis today
   5)Rhabdomyolysis-Very mild elevation in CK in the setting of renal
   failure
   -Will continue to support with IVF
   -Follow CK
   6)COPD-
   -Will need MDI
atrovent at a minimum
   7)GI Bleed
   -No change in HCT with likely [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear and peri-rectal insult
   leading to bleeding
   -GI for endoscopy if more brisk
   -Will continue to follow HCT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male admitted with hypovolemic shock in the setting of recent shellfish ingestion and antecedent illness of water diarrhea. The patient has had a reasonable response to initial volume support but now maintains persistent and significant metabolic acidosis with both gap and non-gap components.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Shock: The patient remains with some persistent hypovolemia with continued positive fluid balance. The plan is to continue bolusing PRN and move to PICC today.
2. Diarrhea: The patient has large-volume watery diarrhea concerning for an infectious source. Follow-up stool cultures and results will be pursued. Based on the large volume of watery diarrhea, symptomatic control will be continued as vibrio/viral would appear most likely. If culture results seen or colonic source suspected, empiric antibiotics will be added.
3. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): Likely pre-renal source with ATN likely present as well. Urine lytes and FeNA were done, showing a FeNA of 1.7%. No evidence of muddy brown casts was seen. A renal consult will be pursued if not resolving by today.
4. Acidosis: The patient has had in large part resolution with lactic acidosis improving source. The non-gap acidosis is likely in part attributable to diarrhea. An HCO3- deficit of 5"

   24 Hour Events:
   - CXR showed increasing fluid overload, so turned down fluids to
   100cc/hr, O2sat stable.
   - PM bicarb still low at 14 so gave another 3 amps bicarb plus repleted
   K
   - Gave 40IV lasix at 6pm & 80IV at 10PM
   - Spun urine with renal fellow and saw muddy brown castes
   - Some concern for DIC so added on labs, plan to ask heme fellow to
   check smear
   - Plan to get renal consult
   - heme onc saw no schistocytes on smear
   - 8PM labs demonstrate overall stability but Cr rose to 6.6
   - UOP improved with lasix
   - 12AM ABG c/w with prior, respiratory compensation for metabolic
   acidosis
   - written for additional NaHCO3 in D5W at 100cc/hr

   shock requiring pressor support, now improving clinically with
   worsening ARF.
   .
   # Shock/Gastroenteritis: Blood pressure good overnight with fluids,
   hasn
t needed pressors since admission.  Likely hypovolemic shock from
   diarrhea, vomiting, and poor PO intake.  Given shellfish ingestion,
   vibrio is most likely cause. Negative cdiff.  Remaining cultures
   pending.

   # AG and non-AG Metabolic Acidosis: Bicarb increased to 14 on bicarb
   drip, anion gap decreased to 16. Likely mixed AG/non-AG metabolic
   acidosis. Likely the non-gap acidosis from diarrhea and gap acidosis
   from lactate (hypovolemic shock), uremia.  Correcting non gap AG with
   bicarb drip.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue bicarb drip 100cc/hr, target bicarb 18 to correct non gap
   AG.

   # GIB: From the OSH there is a report of BRBPR but from here only trace
   guaiac positive stools.  Had episode of coffee ground emesis.  This may
   be related to his infectious diarrhea. HCt has dropped since admission,
   but this is in setting of hemoconcentration initially frrom severe
   hypovolemia, and aggressive hydration.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 53-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and diabetes mellitus type 2, was admitted to the ICU with diarrhea and hypovolemic shock. He required pressor support but is now improving clinically. The patient has worsening acute renal failure (ARF), likely due to hypovolemia initially and now possibly acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is making urine with the use of lasix but his creatinine levels are still rising.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, both with an anion gap (AG) and non-AG component. The non-gap acidosis is likely from the diarrhea, while the gap acidosis may be due to lactate from hypovolemic shock and uremia. Bicarbonate was increased to 14 on a bicarbonate drip to correct the non-gap AG.

The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and low oxygen saturation levels. He is on nebulizer treatments standing and as needed, and repeat chest X-rays will be done in the morning. Weaning of oxygen is planned as tolerated.

There is a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to bloody stools and coffee ground emesis. However, the guaiac positive stools may be related to infectious diarrhea. A transfusion and consult with gastroenterology will be arranged.

Liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated but trending down. The patient has a history of hepatitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diarrhea. The patient's medical history includes no known drug allergies. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), and furosemide (Lasix). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of diarrhea.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/63 mmHg to 147/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has increased from 103.9 kg at admission to 115.2 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 7,317 mL with 776 mL given through intravenous fluids, and a total output of 6,910 mL including 1,525 mL of blood products. Urine output is 785 mL, NG output is 50 mL, and stool output is not documented. Drainage from other sources totals 407 mL with a negative balance of 749 mL.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with a SpO2 of 92%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 28 mmHg,"

   - Spun urine with renal fellow and saw muddy brown castes
   - Some concern for DIC so added on labs, plan to ask heme fellow to
   check smear
   - Plan to get renal consult
   - heme onc saw no schistocytes on smear
   - 8PM labs demonstrate overall stability but Cr rose to 6.6

   Assessment and Plan
   53yo M with h/o HCV and DM2 admitted with hypovolemic shock requiring
   and diarrhea.
   .
   # Shock: hypovolemic shock from diarrhea, vomiting, and poor PO intake.
   If infectious/sepsis likely have GI source given GI symptoms. Does have
   hypoxia and PE considered but pt has a h/o COPD and may have long term
   hypoxia from this.
   - Aggressive IVF resuscitation with bicarb administration.
   - Follow up culture data. Negative cdiff.
   - If has further hypotension requiring pressors will need to replace
   central line but for now pressors have been weaned off and if continue
   to be off pressors will not need another line.
   - A-line if needs pressors again.
   .
   # AG and non-AG Metabolic Acidosis: With AG of 20 and change of bicarb
   of 11 on admission suggesting a mixed AG/non-AG metabolic acidosis.
   Likely the non-gap acidosis from diarrhea and gap acidosis from lactate
   (hypovolemic shock) and uremia.
   - Repeat ABG pending
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - 3 amps HCO3 in D5 this morning to replete bicarb with further dosing
   if necessary per PM labs.
   - Recheck in [**2-19**] hours
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely patient has baseline low O2 sats from COPD and likely
   chronic COPD.
   - Nebs standing and PRN
   - repeat CXR in am
   - weaning O2 as pt tolerates
   - Repeat ABG
   .
   # Gastroenteritis: Likely infectious given leukocytosis although other
   possibilities include mesenteric ischemia given report of GIB. Ischemic
   colitis unlikely given no inflammation seen on CT Abd. infectious
   etiologies include Hep A, vibrio, less likely giardia. Also at risk for
   Cdiff given PPI use but cdiff negative x 1.
   - f/u  Stool O+P, hepatits and viral serologies
   - NPO
   - Hepatitis serologies
   .
   # GIB: Unclear whether patient really has a GIB. From the OSH there is
   a report of BRBPR but from here only trace guaiac positive stools.
   - Active T+C
   - check PM hct
   - continue home PPI
   - GI consult if hcts drop given history of esophageal varices and
   higher risk of GIB given cirrhosis
   - Need to get records from [**Hospital3 5496**].
   .
   # Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-18**] shock or component of viral hepatitis.
   Patient already with HCV but per him has been treated and is in
   remission. Also started drinking again recently and may have
   ETOH-hepatitis although this is usually more cholestatic.
   - trend LFTs
   - Viral studies
   - RUQ U/S r/o portal venous thrombosis if other studies unrevealing
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. Likely [**12-18**] hypovolemia (prerenal)
   initially, now likely with ATN as well.
   - Liberal IVF
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - FeNa = 1.7%, no muddy brown casts
   - Monitor UOP, trend CK.
   .
   # ETOH: Drinking a significant amount of brandy daily and with history
   of shakes in last day from not drinking. Never withdrawl seizures
   before.
   - MVI, Thiamine, Folate
   - CIWA  w prn ativan (has not required since admission)-last drink on
   [**1-26**].
   - SW consult when healthy
   - Seizure precautions
   .
   # DM2: Diet controlled at baseline.
   - ISS
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   # h/o HTN: Now hypotensive
   - hold lisinopril for now
   .
   Prophylaxis: Boots given concern for GIB
   .
   Access: PICC to be placed today. As unlikely to need CVL, can d/c one
   placed at OSH later today.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of HCV and DM2 admitted with hypovolemic shock, likely due to diarrhea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. He also has a history of COPD, which may contribute to his hypoxia. The patient has been aggressively resuscitated with IV fluids and bicarbonate administration.

The patient's laboratory results show a mixed AG/non-AG metabolic acidosis, with an AG of 20 and a change in bicarbonate of 11 on admission. This suggests a combination of non-gap acidosis from diarrhea and gap acidosis from lactate (hypovolemic shock) and uremia. The patient's BUN and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible acute kidney injury (AKI).

There are concerns for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and mesenteric ischemia, but no significant inflammation was seen on the CT abdomen. The patient's leukocytosis suggests an infectious etiology for his gastroenteritis, with possibilities including Hep A, vibrio, and less likely giardia. The patient is at risk for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection but has tested negative for it.

The patient's transaminitis could be related to recent shock or component of viral hepatitis. He has a history of HCV but reports being in remission. Alcohol use may also contribute to liver enzyme elevation.

Renal failure is suspected, with initial hypovolemia (pr"

   Assessment and Plan
   53yo M with h/o HCV and DM2 admitted with hypovolemic shock requiring
   and diarrhea.
   .
   # Shock: Blood pressure good overnight, hasn
t needed pressors since
   admission.  Likely hypovolemic shock from diarrhea, vomiting, and poor
   PO intake. If infectious/sepsis likely have GI source given GI
   symptoms. Negative cdiff.  Remaining cultures pending.
   - Aggressive IVF resuscitation with bicarb administration.
   - Follow up culture data.
   - If has further hypotension requiring pressors will need to replace
   central line but for now pressors have been weaned off and if continue
   to be off pressors will not need another line.
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. Likely [**12-18**] hypovolemia (prerenal)
   initially, now with ATN.  Now making urine with lasix, still with
   rising Cr.
   - Continue diuresis
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, trend CK.
   - renal consult re: possible need for dialysis
   .
   # AG and non-AG Metabolic Acidosis: Bicarb increased to 14 on bicarb
   drip, anion gap decreased to 16. Likely mixed AG/non-AG metabolic
   acidosis. Likely the non-gap acidosis from diarrhea and gap acidosis
   from lactate (hypovolemic shock), uremia.
   - Repeat VBG
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue bicarb drip
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely patient has baseline low O2 sats from COPD and likely
   chronic COPD.  CXR shows no infectious process.
   - Nebs standing and PRN
   - repeat CXR in am
   - weaning O2 as pt tolerates
   .
   # GIB: From the OSH there is a report of BRBPR but from here only trace
   guaiac positive stools.  Had episode of coffee ground emesis.  This may
   be related to his infectious diarrhea. HCt has dropped since admission,
   but this is in setting of hemoconcentration initially frrom severe
   hypovolemia, and aggressive hydration.
   - Active T+C
   - check PM hct
   - continue home PPI
   - GI consult, if repeat episode of
   .
   # Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-18**] shock or component of viral hepatitis.
   Patient already with HCV but per him has been treated and is in
   remission. Also started drinking again recently and may have
   ETOH-hepatitis although this is usually more cholestatic.
   - trend LFTs
   - Viral studies
   - RUQ U/S r/o portal venous thrombosis if other studies unrevealing
   .
   # ETOH: Drinking a significant amount of brandy daily and with history
   of shakes in last day from not drinking. Never withdrawl seizures
   before.
   - MVI, Thiamine, Folate
   - CIWA  w prn ativan (has not required since admission)-last drink on

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of HCV and DM2 admitted with hypovolemic shock requiring aggressive IVF resuscitation. He also has diarrhea and vomiting, with negative C. difficile toxin and pending cultures. The patient's blood pressure has been stable overnight without the need for pressors. He is likely experiencing hypovolemic shock from diarrhea, vomiting, and poor PO intake.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts in the urine, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Diuretics have been started to promote urine output, and medication dosing has been adjusted based on renal function. Avoiding nephrotoxins, monitoring urine output, and considering the need for dialysis are also part of the plan.

The patient has mixed AG/non-AG metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate from hypovolemic shock, uremia, and non-gap acidosis from diarrhea. Bicarbonate administration has been increased to correct the acidosis.

The patient's hypoxia is likely related to chronic COPD, and nebulizer treatments have been initiated. Repeat chest X-rays will be done to monitor for any infectious processes.

There is a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to bloody stools and coffee ground emesis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased since admission, but this may be related to initial hemoconcentration from"

   54 yo male with h/o EtOH abuse admitted with diarrhea and with
   continued large volume small bowel source likely following shellfish
   and now with persistent and worsening renal failurea and substantial
   non-gap acidosis likely related to ATN.
   1)       DIARRHEA-Differential remains broad and we have no significant
   culture results seen.
   -Follow culture results
   -Maintain hydration
   -C. Diff is negative
   2)       RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-Do not see
   urgency for further diuresis, CXR remains unimpressive for edema and
   oxygen requirement is limited
   -has had 500cc out with Lasix given
   -Will hold further lasix at this time to favor renal preservation and
   given that respiratory status is adequate
   -Will have to monitor respiratory status
   -Will have renal consult in place for aid in evaluation and treatment
   3)Metabolic Acidosis-Has significant non-gap acitosis persisting with
   anion-gap related to renal failure perhaps most likely at this time.
   -Will evaluate urine anion gap
which is on previous testing was
   positive value consistent with significant contribution from both GI
   and Renal sources for persistent non-gap acidosis
   -HCO3- to target serum bicarb of 18
   GI Bleed-
   -Follow HCT
   -No active further losses
   -Will have to follow for varices or other sources of acute loss

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of HCV and DM2 admitted with diarrhea and hypovolemic shock. He is currently tolerating a BRAT diet, and his stool output has significantly decreased. His blood pressure is stable without the need for pressors since admission. The patient's clinical improvement suggests that he is recovering from hypovolemic shock, initially caused by diarrhea, vomiting, and poor oral intake.

However, the patient is now experiencing worsening acute renal failure (ARF). His serum creatinine levels have been rising, indicating impaired kidney function. The initial thought was pre-renal hypovolemia, but now it seems to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with good urine output and decreasing creatinine kinase (CK) levels. The patient's renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities, and his urine anion gap is 8 on the morning of 1/30. Renal dosing of medications and avoiding nephrotoxins should be considered.

The patient also has a metabolic acidosis, initially mixed AG/non-AG, from diarrhea and uremia. His serum bicarbonate level is 20 on morning labs after bicarbonate gtt. The urine anion gap is 8 on 1/30 AM. The patient's COPD is stable, and he is currently not requiring supplemental oxygen. Albuterol nebs q2H PRN and ipratropium nebs q6H can be continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted with diarrhea and hypovolemic shock, which required pressor support. His condition has improved clinically, but he now presents with worsening acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has tolerated a BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) diet and has decreased stool output. Negative C. difficile tests were conducted twice, and renal ultrasound showed normal kidneys without evidence of hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or discrete masses. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure range of 155/95-108 mmHg, heart rate between 87-113 bpm, respiratory rate of 15-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's weight is currently 117.9 kg, with a height of 72 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,040 mL and output of 3,695 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -655 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated serum bicarbonate (HCO3), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient has mild hypoxia due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently not requiring supplemental oxygen. He also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), transaminitis,"

   Comments:
   Communication: Patient
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of hypovolemic shock, gastroenteritis, acute renal failure, AG and non-AG metabolic acidosis, COPD, gastrointestinal bleeding, transaminitis, alcohol abuse, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted with diarrhea and hypovolemic shock requiring pressor support, but is now improving clinically with worsening acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate ongoing renal dysfunction. This may lead to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

2. Infection: The patient has several pending cultures, indicating a possible infection. This could be due to his compromised immune system as a result of alcohol abuse and chronic illnesses.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient's hemoglobin levels are stable, there is still a risk of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, especially considering the presence of coffee ground emesis and guaiac positive stools.

4. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a significant history of alcohol abuse and recently stopped drinking. He may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which can include seizures and delirium tremens.

5. Hypoxia: The patient's baseline low O2 saturation requires careful monitoring, especially considering his mild COPD.

6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are low, indicating a need for correction to prevent further acid-base disturbances."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of HCV and DM2, admitted with diarrhea and hypovolemic shock. He has been improving clinically but is now experiencing worsening acute renal failure (ARF). Other conditions include gastroenteritis, COPD, possible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), transaminitis, alcohol use disorder, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have been rising, indicating worsening ARF. It is important to monitor urine output, trends in creatinine kinase (CK), and follow up with renal recommendations.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): Although the patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable, there is a report of bloody brown rice-like stools and a trace guaiac positive stool. Further evaluation and active treatment for GIB should be considered.

3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, which could be due to his history of HCV or recent alcohol consumption. Monitoring liver enzymes and consulting a hepatology specialist would be advisable.

4. Alcohol Use Disorder: The patient has a significant history of daily brandy consumption and recent withdrawal symptoms. Continued monitoring for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and providing appropriate treatment and support are necessary.

5. Hypotension: The patient initially required pressor support for hypovolemic shock but"

   Assessment and Plan
   53yo M with h/o HCV and DM2 admitted with diarrhea and hypovolemic
   shock requiring pressor support, now improving clinically with
   worsening ARF.
   # Shock/Gastroenteritis: Blood pressure good overnight with fluids,
   hasn
t needed pressors since admission.  Likely hypovolemic shock from
   diarrhea, vomiting, and poor PO intake.  Given shellfish ingestion,
   vibrio is most likely cause. Negative cdiff.  Remaining cultures
   pending.
   - Aggressive IVF resuscitation
 bolus LR to match outputs
   - Follow up culture data.
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. Initially thought to be [**12-18**]
   hypovolemia (prerenal), now with ATN and rising Cr, but making urine.
   Negative renal ultrasound. Urine AG 8 on [**1-30**] AM, improved from prior.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, trend CK
   - F/U renal recs
   # AG and non-AG Metabolic Acidosis: Bicarb increased to 14 on bicarb
   drip, anion gap decreased to 16. Likely mixed AG/non-AG metabolic
   acidosis. Likely the non-gap acidosis from diarrhea and gap acidosis
   from lactate (hypovolemic shock), uremia.  Correcting non gap AG with
   bicarb drip.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue bicarb drip 100cc/hr, target bicarb 18 to correct non gap
   AG.
   # COPD: Patient with mild hypoxia & baseline low O2 sats from COPD.
   Required low flow O2 by NC initially, but currently sat
ing well on RA.
   CXR without pulmonary edema or e/o infectious process.
   - Albuterol nebs q2H:PRN
   - Ipratropium nebs q6H
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   # GIB: Hct stable at 37.9 today. From the OSH there is a report of
   BRBPR but from here only trace guaiac positive stools.  Had single
   episode of coffee ground emesis on admission. HCT initially dropped on
   admissionin setting of hemoconcentration and aggressive hydration, but
   no significant changes since [**1-29**].
   - Active T+C
   - Continue home PPI
   - Trend Hct
   # Transaminitis: LFT
s now trending down. Patient already with HCV but
   per him has been treated and is in remission. Also started drinking
   again recently and may have ETOH-hepatitis.
   - Trend LFTs
   - SW consult
   # ETOH: Last drink, [**1-26**]. Drinking a significant amount of brandy daily
   and with history of shakes in last day from not drinking. No h/o
   withdrawal seizures.
   - CIWA  discontinued today as patient has not triggered
   - MVI, Thiamine, Folate
   - SW consult
   - Seizure precautions
   # DM2: Diet controlled at baseline.
   - ISS
   - Diabetic diet
   # h/o HTN: Currently normotensive

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Diabetes Mellitus Type 2. He was admitted with diarrhea and hypovolemic shock, requiring pressor support. The patient's condition has improved clinically, but he is now experiencing worsening acute renal failure (ARF). 

The patient has a negative C. difficile test and pending stool cultures. He is receiving aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and will follow up with culture data. The cause of the diarrhea and hypovolemic shock is suspected to be Vibrio due to shellfish ingestion.

The patient's ARF is initially thought to be pre-renal due to hypovolemia, but now it appears to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a rising creatinine level. The urine anion gap is 8, indicating a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. 

The patient also has mild hypoxia and a history of COPD, for which he was given low flow oxygen by nasal cannula initially but is now doing well without it. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or infection on chest X-ray.

The patient has a stable hemoglobin level and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), but only trace guaiac positive stools were observed. 

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and he has a history of Hepatitis C. He has recently started drinking alcohol again, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of hypovolemic shock, gastroenteritis, acute renal failure, AG metabolic acidosis, COPD, gastrointestinal bleeding, transaminitis, alcohol abuse, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted with diarrhea and hypovolemic shock but is currently improving clinically. The patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure within normal range and oxygen saturation at 92%. He has mild hypoxia due to COPD.

The patient tolerated a BRAT diet and has decreased stool output. His C. difficile test came back negative twice, and Vibrio culture is pending. The patient's renal function is worsening, with rising creatinine levels. His urine output is good, and CK level is decreasing. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and has not had any withdrawal seizures. He was given CIWA and discontinued due to no triggers. He is also taking MVI, Thiamine, Folate, and a consultation for social work has been arranged.

The patient's liver enzymes are trending down, but there may be a possibility of ETOH-induced hepatitis due to recent alcohol consumption. He has a history of hypertension but is currently mildly hypertensive, and lisinopril has been withheld due to renal failure. Metoprolol tartrate 25mg x 1 may be considered if blood pressure remains elevated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diarrhea. The patient has been tolerating a BRAT diet, and renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities. C. diff tests were negative twice. The patient's bicarbonate level is elevated at 16, and creatinine continues to rise to 8.2 with stable BUN. Fluid management recommendations include changing fluids to 1/2 NS with 75 mEq of Na bicarb titrated to I/O even. The urine anion gap is 8. The patient experienced wheezing on exam, and the ventilator rate was decreased to 20 cc/hr.

Medications include furosemide (Lasix) and pantoprazole (Protonix). There are no known drug allergies. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the presence of diarrhea. The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/95 mmHg to 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's weight has increased from 103.9 kg to 117.9 kg since admission.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,040 mL (808 mL of IV fluids) and an output of 3,695 mL (670 mL of urine). The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery but no invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 28, HCO3 of 77, and O2 saturation of 92%.

Physical examination findings include normal peripheral pulses, skin not assessed, and neurologic status not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Imaging studies include a renal ultrasound showing normal-appearing kidneys and a chest X-ray showing clear lungs with no evidence of pulmonary edema.

Impressions include no pulmonary edema, pending stool and O&P cultures, and negative urine culture.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care with a BRAT diet, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and placement of a PICC line. Prophylactic measures include boots for DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole, and VAP prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels and stable BUN suggest ongoing renal dysfunction. The elevated bicarbonate level may indicate metabolic alkalosis, which could be related to the use of sodium bicarbonate in the IV fluids. The urine anion gap is elevated, which could indicate a renal tubular acidosis or another renal issue.

2. Respiratory complications: The patient's wheezing and decreased ventilator rate suggest possible respiratory distress or obstruction. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is essential to prevent further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's labs show slightly elevated levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride. These imbalances should be carefully managed to avoid complications like cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

4. Infection: Although the urine culture was negative, stool cultures are pending. The patient's diarrhea could be due to an infectious cause, which needs to be identified and treated promptly to prevent"

   needed pressors since admission. Initially, hypovolemic shock from
   diarrhea, vomiting, and poor PO intake.  Now with significantly
   decreased stool output, no further emesis, tolerating a BRAT diet.
   Given shellfish ingestion, Vibrio is most likely cause, but cultures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Type 2 Diabetes who was admitted with diarrhea and hypovolemic shock. The patient has been improving clinically but is now experiencing worsening Acute Renal Failure (ARF). 

The patient's initial presentation included hypovolemic shock from diarrhea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. He is now tolerating a BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) diet and has significantly decreased stool output. Negative C. difficile tests have been performed twice, and cultures for stool and urine are pending. The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels.

The patient also has a history of COPD and is mildly hypoxic. He required low flow oxygen via nasal cannula initially but is now stable on room air. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pulmonary edema or infectious process. The patient's COPD management includes albuterol nebs every 2 hours as needed, ipratropium nebs every 6 hours, and a repeat chest X-ray in the morning.

There is a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to the reported blood-tinged brownish-red blood per rectal (BRBPR) and trace guaiac positive stools. However, the patient's hemoglobin concentration has remained relatively stable.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a chief complaint of diarrhea and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has improved with decreased diarrhea output and increased urine flow. However, the patient's creatinine levels continue to rise. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol withdrawal, and diarrhea. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition via a PO diet, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as DVT boots, stress ulcer PPI, and VAP precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient has a history of COPD, which can lead to acute exacerbations. This can be precipitated by factors such as respiratory infections, exposure to irritants, or inadequate management of symptoms.
2. Delirium tremens (DTs): Although the patient is not currently active with alcohol withdrawal symptoms, there is a risk for the development of DTs, a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by altered mental status, hallucinations, and autonomic instability.
3. Renal failure progression: Despite improvements in other aspects of the patient's condition, the continued rise in creatinine indicates ongoing renal impairment. This could potentially progress to more severe renal failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Infection: The patient's diarrhea initially suggested an infectious etiology. Although the diarrhea is improving, there remains a risk of infection, particularly in the ICU setting where patients are at"
