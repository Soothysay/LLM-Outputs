   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   74 yo man with cryptogenic cirrhosis, ESRD on HD.  came for bleeding
   from fistual site.  Was admitted for bleeding fistual on [**5-19**]. In ED
   had not active bleeding, but noted to have postive blood cx from prior
   admission.  Remarked that he was feeling bad, admitted to floor.  BP
   was 60/d on lower extremity.  Was mentating well and asymptomatic.
   Midodrine was restarted and got 1L IVF, with no improvement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presented with bleeding from a fistula site and was admitted on [**5-19**]. He is currently in the ICU and is feeling well, with no active bleeding but with positive blood cultures from prior admission. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 89/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving midodrine, vancomycin, cholestyramine, rifaximin, and omeprazole. He has a history of pulmonary embolism, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and multiple surgeries. There are no known drug allergies. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has a bleeding fistula and a history of bleeding, which could lead to further bleeding complications.
2. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures, indicating a possible infection. He is being treated with linezolid due to a history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at 89/50 mmHg, indicating hypotension, which could"

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.
   # Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP 60s-70s UEs and
   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential does
   include sepsis however from bacteremia given known positive blood cx.
   AM cortisol previously checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.
   - closely follow BPs in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   - [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] need small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in UE >90 in LE
   - no pressors needed
   - cont midodrine for now
   - trend lactate to assess end organ perfusion
   - follow up surveillance cx and speciation of GPCs
   - daptomycin as below
   # Bacteremia: Pt afebrile with mild leukocytosis (no left-shift). GPCs
   in chains growing from [**5-19**] blood cx now proven to be enterococcus (no
   sensitivities). PICC tip cx no growth (final). No other localizing s/s
   infection aside from sacral/perineal skin break down. No murmur or
   stigmata of endocarditis appreciated.
   - daptomycin given after HD
   - F/U blood cx
   - Depending on micro data, may need TTE
   # R AV fistula bleeding: Pt now presenting with second episode of
   bleeding from AV fistula in last 2 HD sessions. He was seen by
   transplant surgery in ED and they felt bleeding had resolved however
   will likely need some intervention or plan since pt cannot be referred
   to ED and admitted each HD session.
   - continue to monitor
   - repeat HCT, am coags
   - type and screen
   - appreciate transplant surgery recommendations
   - fistulogram reportedly normal
   # Tachycardia: C/w baseline HR in 110s.  Difficult to assess if afib
   given poor baseline; not noted in PMH.
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to bacteremia. Has trended down from
   yesterday, possibly since PICC line removed. Pt does have chronic
   diarrhea but C. diff is on differential.
   - trend
   - check C. diff
   - cont vanc as above
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Currently does not appear infected.
   - lidocaine jelly
   - f/u any new wound consult recommendations
   # Oral candidiasis: Concerning for immunocompromised state given HIV
   risk factors but has reportedly refused testing in past
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   # ESRD: On HD T,TH, Sat.
   - Continue nephrocaps.
   - f/u renal recs
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: Stable. Continue rifaximin.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Elevated from baseline
   .
   # Chronic diarrhea: Pt has chronic diarrhea but given concern for C
   diff will hold loperamide until ruled out C diff again, continue
   cholesytramine
   - c. diff negative
   - hold loperamide for now
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, low Na, K diet

   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots given bleed
   -Bowel regimen held given diarrhea
   -Pain management with tylenol

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.
   # Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP 60s-70s UEs and
   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential
   however does include sepsis from bacteremia given known positive blood
   cx. AM cortisol previously checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.
   - closely follow BPs in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   - [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] need small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in UE, >90 in LE
   - no pressors needed
   - cont midodrine for now
   - trend lactate to assess end organ perfusion: currently elevated to
   5.4 but in setting of Cr elevation; will repeat
   - follow up surveillance cx and speciation of GPCs
   - daptomycin as below
   # Bacteremia: Pt afebrile with mild leukocytosis (no left-shift). GPCs
   in chains growing from [**5-19**] blood cx now proven to be enterococcus (no
   sensitivities). PICC tip cx no growth (final). No other localizing s/s
   infection aside from sacral/perineal skin break down. No murmur or
   stigmata of endocarditis appreciated.
   - daptomycin given after HD, day 1 = [**5-21**]
   - F/U blood cx
   - Depending on micro data, ordered for TTE
   # R AV fistula bleeding: Pt now presenting with second episode of
   bleeding from AV fistula in last 2 HD sessions. He was seen by
   transplant surgery in ED and they felt bleeding had resolved however
   will likely need some intervention or plan since pt cannot be referred
   to ED and admitted each HD session.
   - continue to monitor
   - repeat HCT, am coags
   - type and screen
   - appreciate transplant surgery recommendations
   - fistulogram reportedly normal
   # Tachycardia: C/w baseline HR in 110s.  Difficult to assess if afib
   given poor baseline; not noted in PMH.
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to bacteremia. Has trended down from
   yesterday, possibly since PICC line removed. Pt does have chronic
   diarrhea but C. diff is on differential.
   - trend
   - C. diff negative X1
   - cont vanc as above
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Currently does not appear infected.
   - lidocaine jelly
   - f/u any new wound consult recommendations
   # Oral candidiasis: Concerning for immunocompromised state given HIV
   risk factors but has reportedly refused testing in past
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   # ESRD: On HD T,TH, Sat.
   - Continue nephrocaps.
   - f/u renal recs
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: Stable. Continue rifaximin.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Elevated from baseline
   .
   # Chronic diarrhea: Pt has chronic diarrhea but given concern for C
   diff will hold loperamide until ruled out C diff again, continue
   cholesytramine
   - c. diff negative X1
   - Restart loperamide given negative c diff
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with bleeding fistula and bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia from increased fluid removal at HD, blood loss from the fistula, or sepsis from bacteremia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.0C, heart rate in the 100s bpm, blood pressure ranging from 66/27 mmHg to 118/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals signs consistent with his medical history and current conditions.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring and small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in the upper extremities and >90 in the lower extremities. Pressors are not needed at this time.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has an infection caused by Enterococcus bacteria, as evidenced by positive blood cultures. Treatment with daptomycin has been initiated.

3. AV Fistula Bleeding: The patient has experienced two episodes of bleeding from the arteriovenous (AV) fistula used for hemodialysis. Further intervention or plan is needed to address this"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with a bleeding fistula and hypotension, indicating possible septic shock. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and a slightly elevated temperature. The patient has been receiving daptomycin for septic shock caused by Enterococcus bacteremia. There is a bruit over the right arm fistula, but peripheral pulses could not be assessed. The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis, anemia, elevated creatinine, and hyponatremia. The patient's neurologic status is currently not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is being treated for septic shock due to Enterococcus bacteremia. If left untreated or if the infection spreads further, it can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Bleeding Fistula: The presence of a bleeding fistula suggests an underlying vascular issue. If the fistula continues to bleed, it may result in significant blood loss and require surgical intervention.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can compromise blood flow to vital organs. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to organ ischemia and potential failure.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The note mentions impaired skin integrity, which could be a result of poor perfusion or pressure injuries. These conditions can increase the risk of infection and delay healing.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hem"

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.
   # Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP 60s-70s UEs and
   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential
   however does include sepsis from bacteremia given known positive blood
   cx, now speciated to sensitive entertococcus. AM cortisol previously
   checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.
   - closely follow BPs in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   - [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] need small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in UE, >90 in LE
   - no pressors needed
   - cont midodrine for now
   - trend lactate to assess end organ perfusion: currently elevated to
   4.7 but in setting of Cr elevation; will repeat again this morning
   - change Abx as below
   # Bacteremia: Pt afebrile with mild leukocytosis (no left-shift). GPCs
   in chains growing from [**5-19**] blood cx now proven to be enterococcus (no
   sensitivities). PICC tip cx no growth (final). No other localizing s/s
   infection aside from sacral/perineal skin break down. No murmur or
   stigmata of endocarditis appreciated.
   - daptomycin given after HD, day 1 = [**5-21**]
 consider change to
   ampicillin given enterococcus is sensitive
   - F/U blood cx
   - Depending on micro data, ordered for TTE (not done yesterday)
   # R AV fistula bleeding: Pt now presenting with second episode of
   bleeding from AV fistula in last 2 HD sessions. He was seen by
   transplant surgery in ED and they felt bleeding had resolved however
   will likely need some intervention or plan since pt cannot be referred
   to ED and admitted each HD session.  Fistulogram read as normal.  Hct
   dropped to 37.8 from recent baseline in 40s (could also relate to fluid
   shifts from HD schedule).
   - continue to monitor
   - repeat HCT, am coags
   - type and screen
   - appreciate transplant surgery recommendations
   # Tachycardia: C/w baseline HR in 110s.  Difficult to assess if afib
   given poor baseline; not noted in PMH.
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG
   # Brief runs of VT: Noted on telemetry.
   - Replete Mg PRN (monitor K but would not replete given ESRD unless
   low)
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to bacteremia. Has trended down from
   yesterday, possibly since PICC line removed. Pt does have chronic
   diarrhea but C. diff is on differential.
   - trend
   - C. diff negative X1
   - cont Abx as above
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Currently does not appear infected.
   - lidocaine jelly
   - follow wound consult recommendations
   # Oral candidiasis: Concerning for immunocompromised state given HIV
   risk factors but has reportedly refused testing in past
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   # ESRD: On HD T,TH, Sat.
   - Continue nephrocaps.
   - f/u renal recs
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: Stable. Continue rifaximin.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Elevated from baseline
   .
   # Chronic diarrhea: Pt has chronic diarrhea but given concern for C
   diff will hold loperamide until ruled out C diff again, continue
   cholesytramine
   - c. diff negative X1
   - Restart loperamide given negative c diff
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, low Na, K diet

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He was admitted with bleeding from an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to fluid removal during hemodialysis, blood loss from the AV fistula, or sepsis related to bacteremia. His blood cultures have grown Enterococcus, which is sensitive to ampicillin, so a change in antibiotics is being considered.

The patient also has leukocytosis, possibly related to bacteremia, and elevated lactate levels indicating potential end-organ perfusion issues. His AV fistula has bled twice during hemodialysis sessions, and a fistulogram showed it to be normal. The patient's baseline heart rate is in the 100s to 120s, with occasional runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT) on telemetry. He has oral thrush and a sacral decubitus ulcer, but it does not appear infected. The patient has chronic diarrhea but tests negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) again. His thrombocytopenia has improved from baseline.

The patient's medications include daptomycin for bacteremia, midodrine for hypotension, and various other medications for his chronic conditions such as cirrhosis and ESR"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cryptogenic cirrhosis, and a bleeding fistula. He is currently in the ICU with hypotension and Enterococcus bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 104/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 126 mg/dL.

Physical examination reveals stage 3 sacral ulcer, stage 2 left ischial ulcer, and scattered petechiae bilaterally. Neurological examination is not assessed due to patient's unresponsiveness. The patient has a code status of full code and is expected to be transferred to the floor within the next 1-2 days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presence of hypotension, fever, and positive blood cultures for Enterococcus bacteremia suggests the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics are necessary.
2. Decubitus ulcers: The presence of stage 3 sacral ulcer and stage 2 left ischial ulcer indicates the risk of further skin breakdown and deep tissue injury. Proper wound care and pressure relief measures should be implemented to prevent worsening of these ulcers.

   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.

   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential
   however does include sepsis from bacteremia given known positive blood

   checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He was admitted with bleeding from an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing chronic diarrhea, leukocytosis, and oral thrush. He also has a sacral decubitus ulcer and thrombocytopenia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has had episodes of hypotension and tachycardia. He is currently on a two-week course of daptomycin for bacteremia. The patient's blood cultures initially grew Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (VRE), but repeat cultures were negative. The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management with hemodialysis, and his cirrhosis is stable. He has a planned transfer to a rehabilitation facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which may be related to fluid shifts from hemodialysis, blood loss from the AV fistula, or sepsis due to bacteremia.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with Enterococcus species, for which he is receiving daptomycin. Close monitoring of blood cultures and lactate levels is necessary to assess end-organ perfusion.
3. AV Fistula Bleeding: The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He was admitted with bleeding from an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to fluid removal during hemodialysis and blood loss from the AV fistula. His blood cultures showed growth of enterococcus, specifically vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). He has been started on daptomycin for a two-week course. The patient also has leukocytosis, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels, indicating possible end-organ perfusion issues. He has an AV fistula bleed, oral thrush, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. His thrombocytopenia has improved, and he has chronic diarrhea. He is on hemodialysis three times a week and is being monitored for various complications such as hypotension, bacteremia, tachycardia, and AV fistula bleeding.

   Ordered for TTE but not yet done
   Assessment and Plan
   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP 60s-70s UEs and
   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential
   however does include sepsis from bacteremia given known positive blood
   cx, now speciated to sensitive entertococcus. AM cortisol previously
   checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.
   - closely follow BPs in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   - [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] need small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in UE, >90 in LE
   - no pressors needed
   - cont midodrine for now
   - trend lactate to assess end organ perfusion: currently elevated to
   4.7 but in setting of Cr elevation; will repeat again this morning
   .
   # Bacteremia: Pt afebrile with mild leukocytosis (no left-shift). GPCs
   in chains growing from [**5-19**] blood cx now proven to be enterococcus
   (VRE). PICC tip cx no growth (final). No other localizing s/s infection
   aside from sacral/perineal skin break down. No murmur or stigmata of
   endocarditis appreciated.
   - daptomycin q48h given after HD, day 1 = [**5-21**], for two week course
   with hemodialysis (change dialysis schedule so that it is q48h, i.e. T
   Th Sa M W F to complete 2 week course daptomycin, thus preventing need
   for PICC); will order PICC in meantime while determining possibility of
   changing dialysis schedule as described
   - aggressive wound care
   - f/u ID recs
   - F/U blood cx
   - consider TTE
    .
   # Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia.  Patient with 15 second run of
   VT that self-terminated overnight. He has no history of structural
   heart disease, most recent echo ([**5-7**]) with preserved biventricular
   function, mild LVH.
   - correct K to 4 and Mg to 2
   - EKG
   - consider stress testing for risk stratification
   .
   # Oxygen requirement:  Not on oxygen at baseline. No clear etiology;
   will monitor for now. Pt without cough.
   - Obtain CXR
   - wean as tolerated
   .
   # R AV fistula bleeding: Pt now presenting with second episode of
   bleeding from AV fistula in last 2 HD sessions. He was seen by
   transplant surgery in ED and they felt bleeding had resolved however
   will likely need some intervention or plan since pt cannot be referred
   to ED and admitted each HD session.  Fistulogram read as normal.  Hct
   dropped to 37.8 from recent baseline in 40s (could also relate to fluid
   shifts from HD schedule).
   - continue to monitor
   - repeat HCT, am coags
   - type and screen
   - appreciate transplant surgery recommendations
   .
   # Brief runs of VT: Noted on telemetry. Broke spontaneously when pt
   awoke. Pt without prior evidence of structural heart disease.
   - Replete Mg PRN (monitor K but would not replete given ESRD unless
   low)
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to bacteremia. Has trended down,
   possibly related to PICC line removal. Pt does have chronic diarrhea
   but C. diff is on differential.
   - trend
   - C. diff negative X1
   - cont Abx as above
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Currently does not appear infected.
   - lidocaine jelly
   - follow wound consult recommendations
   .
   # Oral candidiasis: Concerning for immunocompromised state given HIV
   risk factors but has reportedly refused testing in past
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # ESRD: On HD T,TH, Sat.
   - Continue nephrocaps.
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: Stable. Continue rifaximin.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Elevated from baseline
   .
   # Chronic diarrhea: Pt has chronic diarrhea thought to be due to ileal
   resection for possible Crohn
s disease in past but given concern for C
   diff will hold loperamide until ruled out C diff again, continue
   cholesytramine
   - c. diff negative X1

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis who was admitted with bleeding fistula and bacteremia. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require close monitoring and management. 

1. Hypotension: The patient has chronically low blood pressure, which can be attributed to ESRD and fluid removal during hemodialysis. The patient's baseline mental status remains unchanged, indicating that sepsis may not be the primary cause of hypotension. However, further evaluation is needed to rule out other potential causes.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for enterococcus (VRE), indicating a bacterial infection. The patient is already receiving daptomycin every 48 hours after hemodialysis for a two-week course with hemodialysis. Repeat blood cultures are negative, suggesting improvement in the bacteremia. Aggressive wound care and follow-up with infectious disease recommendations are important for managing this condition.

3. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced a brief run of VT that self-terminated overnight. This could be due to electrolyte imbalances, and the patient's recent echo showed preserved biventricular function with mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Correcting potassium and magnesium levels, obtaining an EKG, and considering stress testing for risk stratification are recommended.

4. Oxygen requirement: The patient is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He is currently in the ICU due to bleeding fistula, hypotension, and Enterococcal bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable and within normal limits. He has a history of sustained non-specific ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which is being monitored in-house today.

The patient is receiving treatment for septic shock/Enterococcus bacteremia with daptomycin and hemodialysis (HD) every 48 hours. His bleeding fistula is stable with no evidence of further bleeding, and his hemoglobin (Hct) levels are stable as well. He will undergo another session of HD tomorrow.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, specifically decubitus ulcers, which require wound care. He also requires oxygen supplementation with 2 liters of oxygen per requirement. A chest X-ray (CXR) should be checked to assess his respiratory status.

The patient's electrolytes are normal, and he has a history of ESRD, which is being managed accordingly. The remainder of the issues will be addressed by the ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock/Enterococcus Bacteremia: The patient's condition may worsen if the septic shock does not respond to treatment, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Non-Sustained Ventricular T"
