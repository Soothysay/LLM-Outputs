   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   85 yo man well known to MICU with diastolic and systolic HF, ESRD on
   HD, PPM, thrombocytopenia, presented originally from OSH with SOB.
   Found to be hypercarbic on admission to MICU.  Did well and was
   transferred to the floor.  Was tapped on the floor - 1L removed,
   transudative.  This AM on floor, found to be somnolent 7.27/70/89.  Has

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of diastolic and systolic heart failure, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, permanent pacemaker, and thrombocytopenia. He presented to the MICU with shortness of breath and was found to be hypercarbic. He did well and was transferred to the floor, but the next morning he was somnolent with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7 (out of 15). He was subsequently improved upon transfer back to the MICU. He has not received any sedative agents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline restrictive lung disease, fluid overload, large effusions, and worsening restriction indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. Consideration should be given to using nighttime non-invasive positive airway pressure (NIPPV) when the patient is asleep to improve oxygenation.
2. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient requires more than 10 kg of fluid removal due to heart failure, but his blood pressure may limit this approach.
3. Atrial fibrillation on amiodarone: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with amiodarone. Monitoring for any adverse effects or complications related to amiodarone therapy is essential.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count puts him"

   copmlete heart block (now s/p PPM [**6-7**]) ESRD on HDHD, h/o MRSA
   bacteremia and thrombocytopenia thought [**1-31**] PPI who is transferred to
   MICU for hypercapnia and somnolence.
   #.   Hypercapnia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4688**] has had evidence of hypercapnia for 2
   months.  This is likely from a combination of bilateral pleural
   effusions along with intrathoracic hernia.  Sleep apnea also a
   possibility as his hypercapnia seems to be worse in the morning.
   Dyspnea likely [**1-31**] pleural effusions and volume overload which has been
   difficult to get off because patient becomes hypotensive on HD.

   - O2 sat > 92%
   - cont HD for removal of excess fluid

 last day today per OSH records
   #. Diastolic heart failure: Last ECHO [**2133-7-17**] with EF >55% and mild
   mitral regurgitation
   -          HD as above is not taking off fluid well because patient
   becomes hypotensive with HD. Will likely need CVVH to take fluid off
   slowly so that we can keep his BP stable while taking off his extra
   fluids.
   -          Daily weights
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient is currently AV-paced
   - cont outpatient amiodarone
   - no anticoagulation given recent GI bleed
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-31**] to drug reaction one month ago

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure, complete heart block (now with pacemaker), end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (HD), and previous MRSA bacteremia and thrombocytopenia. He was transferred to the MICU for hypercapnia and somnolence. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation overnight and will continue BiPap at night due to better ABG results. He requires MWF HD treatments and has a positive C. diff toxin. The patient's diastolic heart failure is not responding well to HD, resulting in hypotension. CVVH may be necessary to remove excess fluid slowly while maintaining stable blood pressure. The patient is currently AV-paced for atrial fibrillation and has thrombocytopenia, which could be related to a drug reaction or myelodysplastic syndrome. An outpatient Heme/Onc consult is considered.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercapnia: The patient has evidence of hypercapnia for 2 months due to bilateral pleural effusions, intrathoracic hernia, and potential sleep apnea. Dyspnea is likely caused by pleural effusions and volume overload, which is challenging to manage during HD.

2. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient is on MWF HD treatments. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure, complete heart block, ESRD on HDHD, MRSA bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, and previous use of proton pump inhibitors. He was transferred to the MICU for hypercapnia and somnolence. The patient has evidence of hypercapnia for two months, likely due to bilateral pleural effusions, intrathoracic hernia, and potential sleep apnea. He also has end-stage renal disease and is on maintenance dialysis treatments on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The patient had Clostridium difficile colitis in the past and is currently being treated with vancomycin. He has a history of diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and is currently ventricular-paced. The patient's thrombocytopenia is thought to be related to a drug reaction from proton pump inhibitors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnia: The patient's hypercapnia is likely due to bilateral pleural effusions, intrathoracic hernia, and possible sleep apnea. Repeating a chest X-ray to evaluate for reaccumulation of right effusion, following up with a repeat arterial blood gas (ABG), maintaining oxygen saturation above 92%, and continuing hemodialysis for fluid removal are important for managing this condition.

2. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with a chief complaint of hypercarbic respiratory failure. They have been intubated and placed on CPAP/PSV ventilation support. The patient tolerated CPAP overnight and their vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/59 to 135/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient is diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure with gross fluid overload. This condition may lead to further worsening of heart function and fluid retention.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which indicates difficulty in exhaling carbon dioxide from the lungs. If not properly managed, this can progress into more severe respiratory failure.

3. Infection: The patient has completed a course of oral vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection. Although the treatment is completed, there is still a risk of infection recurrence or development of other infections due to the patient's compromised immune system.

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a fluid balance of +60 mL since 12"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 85 year old male with history of diastolic heart failure,
   copmlete heart block (now s/p PPM [**6-7**]) ESRD on HDHD, h/o MRSA
   bacteremia and thrombocytopenia thought [**1-31**] PPI who is transferred to
   MICU for hypercapnia and somnolence.
   #.   Hypercapnia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4688**] has had evidence of hypercapnia for 2
   months.  This is likely from a combination of bilateral pleural
   effusions along with intrathoracic hernia.  Sleep apnea also a
   possibility as his hypercapnia seems to be worse in the morning.
   Dyspnea likely [**1-31**] pleural effusions and volume overload which has been
   difficult to get off because patient becomes hypotensive on HD.
   - f/u repeat ABG
   - O2 sat > 92% with CPAP and BiPAP and shovel mask
   - cont HD for removal of excess fluid. Still considering CVVH
   - Overall resp status worsening
   #. End Stage Renal Disease:  Patient on MWF HD treatments
   - Considering daily HD versus CVVH
   #. C Diff colitis: Patient with (+) C diff tox x 3 during admission in
   [**Month (only) 591**].  On Vanco at [**Hospital 12**] rehab until [**2133-8-24**].
   - Now D/Ced. Following.
   #. Diastolic heart failure: Last ECHO [**2133-8-24**] with EF >55%
   -          HD as above is not taking off fluid well because patient
   becomes hypotensive with HD. Will likely need CVVH to take fluid off
   slowly so that we can keep his BP stable while taking off his extra
   fluids.
   -          Daily weights
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient is currently AV-paced
   - cont outpatient amiodarone
   - no anticoagulation given recent GI bleed
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-31**] to drug reaction one month ago
   (PPI), currently at 61, down from 113 at last admisstion. ?MDS
   - consider outpatient Heme/Onc consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure, complete heart block (now s/p PPM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), h/o MRSA bacteremia and thrombocytopenia thought [1-31] PPI, who is transferred to MICU for hypercapnia and somnolence.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from the information given in the note:

1. Hypercapnia: The patient has evidence of hypercapnia for 2 months. This is likely due to a combination of bilateral pleural effusions along with intrathoracic hernia. Sleep apnea is also a possibility as his hypercapnia seems to be worse in the morning. Dyspnea is likely caused by pleural effusions and volume overload, which has been difficult to get off because the patient becomes hypotensive on HD.

2. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient is on MWF HD treatments. Considering daily HD versus continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis: The patient has tested positive for C. diff toxin three times during admission in [Month 591]. On Vancomycin at [Hospital 12] rehab until [2133-8-24]. Now discharged. Following.

   CXR: left lobe collapse, increase in right pleural effusion
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 85 year old male with history of diastolic heart failure,
   copmlete heart block (now s/p PPM [**6-7**]) ESRD on HDHD, h/o MRSA
   bacteremia and thrombocytopenia thought [**1-31**] PPI who is transferred to
   MICU for hypercapnia and somnolence.
   #.   Hypercapnia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4688**] has had evidence of hypercapnia for 2
   months.  This is likely from a combination of bilateral pleural
   effusions along with intrathoracic hernia.  Sleep apnea also a
   possibility as his hypercapnia seems to be worse in the morning.
   Dyspnea likely [**1-31**] left lung collapse, pleural effusions, volume
   overload which has been difficult to get off because patient becomes
   hypotensive on HD.
   - f/u repeat ABG
   - O2 sat > 92% with CPAP and BiPAP and shovel mask.  Will not intubate
   - Overall resp status worsening
   #. End Stage Renal Disease:  Patient on MWF HD treatments
   - will not tolerate HD given low BPs
   #. C Diff colitis: Patient with (+) C diff tox x 3 during admission in
   [**Month (only) 591**].  On Vanco at [**Hospital 12**] rehab until [**2133-8-24**].
   - Now D/Ced. Following.
   #. Diastolic heart failure: Last ECHO [**2133-8-24**] with EF >55%
   -          HD as above is not taking off fluid well because patient
   becomes hypotensive with HD. Would need CVVH to take fluid off slowly
   so that we can keep his BP stable while taking off his extra fluids.
   -          Daily weights
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient is currently AV-paced
   - cont outpatient amiodarone
   - no anticoagulation given recent GI bleed
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-31**] to drug reaction one month ago
   (PPI), currently at 61, down from 113 at last admisstion. ?MDS
   - consider outpatient Heme/Onc consult

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure, complete heart block, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and a history of MRSA bacteremia and thrombocytopenia. He was transferred to the MICU for hypercapnia and somnolence. The patient has evidence of hypercapnia for 2 months, likely due to bilateral pleural effusions, intrathoracic hernia, and possible sleep apnea. Dyspnea may be attributed to left lung collapse, pleural effusions, and volume overload. The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and he has been unable to tolerate hemodialysis due to low blood pressure. He has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis and is no longer on vancomycin. The patient's most recent transthoracic echo showed severe left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function, right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis, and moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. His atrial fibrillation is currently being managed with AV pacing. The patient's platelet count is thrombocytopenic and is thought to be due to a drug reaction from proton pump inhibitors. He has been started on non-invasive ventilation and has been made DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnia: The patient's chronic hypercapnia could lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypercarbic respiratory failure, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD). He experienced shortness of breath and hypercapnia during hemodialysis yesterday, leading to the initiation of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at 12:00 PM. However, he was taken off NIV overnight and desaturated to 73%, prompting the reintroduction of NIV with improvement in saturation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 mmHg to 121/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on face tent with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient has preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on trans-thoracic echo and similar right ventricular hypertrophy compared to the prior study.

Allergies include Flagyl (metronidazole) and proton pump inhibitors (benzimidazole), with a rash and thrombocytopenia. The last dose of antibiotics, vancomycin, was administered on 08/23 at 04:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving amio, nephrocaps, carafate, calcium, chlorhexidine,"
