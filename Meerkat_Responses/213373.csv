   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old female with CAD, dCHF, COPD,
   hypothyroidism, and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op hypotension
   s/p iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy for colon adenoCA.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to intraoperative blood loss and sedation
   since was not hypotensive pre-operatively. Would also consider intraop
   myocardial ischemia as possible etiology with decreased cardiac output,
   however EKG shows stable LBBB, with negative Scarbosa criteria.
   Developing sepsis also a consideration or intraoperative
   infection/perforation so will empirically treat for possible sepsis.
   She has not had leukocytosis or fevers but has been relatively
   hypothermic.
   - Transfusion goal of HCT>27 given h/o CAD
   - wean off dobutamine to avoid increased risk arrhythmia
   - trend biomarkers

   - wean off propofol in preparation for SBT
   - wean off neosynephrine
   - maintain UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - Touch base with surgery team
   .
   # Anemia: Likely related to blood loss from surgery and known
   malignancy although estimated blood loss minimal and may also be partly
   secondary to hemodilution since received 3L IVF intraop.
   - check HCT Q8H, tx HCT<27 or active bleed
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient remains intubated after procedure
   secondary to hemodynamic instability and not because of respiratory
   failure. Pt seemed to tolerate PEEP of 0 which seemed to suggest acute
   dCHF not a significant factor on respiratory status.
   - decrease FiO2 now, decrease sedation and change over to PSV as
   tolerated
   - wean off propofol
   - SBT today with goal for extubation
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Pt with significant volume overload
   on CXR after 3L LR and 2 units PRBCs.
   -Since no significant affect on respiratory status, will hold off on
   diuresis for now given weaning neo today
   -Consider diuresis tonight or tomorrow if more stable and will discuss
   with surgery first

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of CAD, dCHF, COPD, hypothyroidism, and colon adenocarcinoma. She underwent an iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy and was transferred to the ICU for post-operative hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with vital signs including a temperature of 35.6Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 117/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is receiving multiple medications including amiodarone, propofol, pantoprazole, and others. The patient has a history of anemia, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to intraoperative blood loss, sedation, myocardial ischemia, sepsis, or an intraoperative infection/perforation.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely related to blood loss from surgery and her known malignancy. Hemodilution may also contribute to the anemia.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has significant volume overload on CXR after receiving intravenous fluids and blood"

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism, and colon adenocarcinoma. She was transferred to the ICU for post-operative hypotension after undergoing an iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure ranging from 112/31-138/62 mmHg, and a heart rate of 75 bpm. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is 94%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, elevated lactate levels at 1.3 mmol/L, and slightly low potassium levels at 3.8 mEq/L. Other lab values, including white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels, are within normal ranges. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension likely due to intraoperative blood loss and sedation, as well as possible myocardial ischemia. She is also being treated empirically for sepsis, although she does not have leukocytosis or fevers. 

The plan is to transfuse two units of blood, wean off dobutamine, trend biomarkers, and reassess if the patient remains hypotensive after fluid repletion. Propofol will be changed to f"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old female with CAD, dCHF, COPD,
   hypothyroidism, and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op hypotension
   s/p iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy for colon adenoCA.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to intraoperative blood loss and sedation
   since was not hypotensive pre-operatively. Would also consider intraop
   myocardial ischemia as possible etiology with decreased cardiac
   output.  Developing sepsis also a consideration or intraoperative
   infection/perforation so will empirically treat for possible sepsis.
   She has not had leukocytosis or fevers but has been relatively
   hypothermic.
   - Transfuse 2 units [**Hospital Unit Name **] now, repeat post-transfusion HCT
   - wean off dobutamine to avoid increased risk arrhythmia
   - trend biomarkers
   - if remains hypotensive after fluid repletion and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] change
   propofol to fentanyl/versed to decrease hypotension but would ideally
   want to extubate in the morning so would not want long acting sedation
   - continue neo, titrate to MAP>65
   - maintain UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - consider TTE in am
   - empiric unasyn for now for possible infection
   - trend CvO2 sat, lactate
   .
   # Anemia: Likely related to blood loss from surgery and known
   malignancy although estimated blood loss minimal and may also be partly
   secondary to hemodilution since received 3L IVF intraop.
   - transfuse 2 units [**First Name3 (LF) **] now,
   - check HCT q8, tx HCT<27 or active bleed
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient remains intubated after procedure
   secondary to hemodynamic instability and not because of respiratory
   failure. Currently on SIMV Vt 500 RR 12, FiO2 80% with ABG 7.39/49/220
   - decrease FiO2 now, decrease sedation and change over to PSV as
   tolerated
   - SBT in am with goal for extubation
   .
   # PAF: Currently sinus with LBBB on PO amio at baseline. Has not been
   anticoagulated in past for unclear reasons, ? [**1-10**] GIB.
   - amio gtt at 0.5mg/hr since not taking POs
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete potassium and other electrolytes, NPO for now,
   possible extubation in am
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots; SC heparin when HCT stable

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of CAD, dCHF, COPD, hypothyroidism, and colon adenoCA who was transferred to the ICU for post-operative hypotension after undergoing an iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, anemia, respiratory failure, and potential atrial fibrillation (PAF) since admission.

Based on the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to intraoperative blood loss, sedation, myocardial ischemia, or developing sepsis. Immediate interventions include transfusing blood products, weaning off dobutamine, trending biomarkers, and potentially changing sedation to decrease hypotension.

2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss from surgery and known malignancy. The estimated blood loss was minimal, but it may also be secondary to hemodilution from receiving 3 liters of intravenous fluids intraoperatively. Transfusion of blood products is recommended to address the anemia.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated after the procedure due to hemodynamic instability rather than respiratory failure. Current ventilator settings include SIMV with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 80%. The goal is to decrease FiO"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female who underwent a partial bowel resection. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several complications. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but was successfully extubated today. She is complaining of chest pain and difficulty breathing, and an EKG was performed but could not be interpreted for ischemia due to a left bundle branch block. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/48 to 178/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a first-degree AV block, central venous pressure of 5 mmHg, and fluid balance showing an input of 3,391 mL and output of 2,914 mL, resulting in a balance of 477 mL. The patient is receiving amiodarone, heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), morphine sulfate, and pantoprazole (Protonix). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is below normal, indicating a lack of adequate oxygen supply to the tissues.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are low, suggesting poor blood flow and perfusion to vital organs.
3. Heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypothyroidism, and a history of colon adenocarcinoma. She was admitted to the ICU for postoperative hypotension following an iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy. The patient has been extubated but is still receiving supplemental oxygen via a face mask. She has crackles in her lungs, and her chest X-ray shows worsening atelectasis and a left-sided effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOXEMIA: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which can be due to the crackles in her lungs and worsening atelectasis. This may require interventions such as increased FiO2 or re-intubation.
2. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure is stable to elevated, but there is a concern for ongoing fluid management. Monitoring vital signs and urine output is important, along with careful diuresis.
3. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC: The patient has a history of dCHF, and her current symptoms may indicate acute decompensation. Close monitoring of fluid status and diuresis is necessary.
4. ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism, and a history of colon adenocarcinoma. She underwent an iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy but experienced post-operative hypotension. She is currently in the ICU and has been extubated but requires supplemental oxygen via face mask. Her vital signs are stable, and she has shown improvement in her pulmonary edema but increased atelectasis on chest X-ray. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels despite being on supplemental oxygen. This could be due to her underlying COPD or atelectasis.
2. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is stable to elevated, and she is off pressors. Close monitoring of vitals and urine output is recommended.
3. Heart Failure (Chronic on Acute): The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, and there may be acute exacerbation due to surgery or fluid overload. Continuous monitoring of volume status and diuresis as needed.
4. Anemia, Acute Secondary to Blood Loss: The patient has a stable hematocrit level, indicating that her anemia is being managed appropriately. Monitoring of vitals and consideration of transfusion if hematocrit drops below 27.
