   Assessment and Plan
   76F with no PMH, longtime smoker, presenting with shortness of breath,
   chest pain, and nausea, now transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for further
   management of right lung and vocal cord masses.
   .
   # Vocal cord mass.  Differential includes cancer (squamous cell cancer
   or metastatic), benign polyp, abscess, hematoma.  Appearance of this
   unclear given little documentation of bronchoscopy findings thus far.
   Mass was biopsied at OSH.  Main question relates to management of large
   airway obstruction.  For now airway secure after placement of ETT.
   Next approach to take - attempt at ENT/surgical resection vs.
   proceeding with tracheostomy with subsequent addressing of mass.  Able
   to pass 7.0 tube, but does seem to have been symptomatic with dyspnea
   and gagging for at least a month per family.
   - ENT consulted, will formally see in AM and scope.
   - IP consulted, will also see in AM.
   - Possible procedure (trach or ?resection) as early as tomorrow
   afternoon.  Will keep NPO, check coags.
   - Maintain ETT in place
   - Followup path from OSH; attempt to obtain tissue samples for [**Hospital1 **] path
   review.
   .
   # R lung mass. Review of OSH CT here suggesting entire RLL collapsed,
   but complicated with ?fluid and gas vs. minimal airway patency.
   Differential includes malignancy (primary or metastatic),
   abscess/necrotizing pneumonia (from aspiration or post obstructive),
   sequestration.  Bronched and biopsied today but not entirely clear what
   was seen.  Seems to be having some bleeding from endotracheal
   suctioning, likely from biopsy today.
   - Rebronch with MICU team vs. IP.
   - Consider thoracics consult if/when appropriate.
   - Send sputum and ?BAL.
   - Followup and obtain path as above.
   - Treat empirically for necrotizing pneumonia - clinda and ceftriaxone
   to start; consider better MRSA and/or atypical coverage if not
   improving; tailor abx based on culture data.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of visualization of cord
   mass as above, but also has significant primary lung pathology
   (baseline emphysematous changes, RLL collapse/mass).
   - Maintain intubated on vent until trach or definitive management of
   vocal cord mass.  Hope for early liberation from vent if trach pursued.
   - Patient with baseline chronic respiratory acidosis vs. metabolic
   alkalosis from vomiting; attempt to maintain CO2s in high 40s/low 50s
   (decrease current minute vents).
   - Decrease respiratory rate to 16 breaths/minute to increase pC02 and
   maintain slight acidosis.
   - MDIs for management of bronchospasm if present.
   .
   # R pleural effusion.  Malignant vs. parapneumonic vs. simple
   transudative.  Too small on imaging to sample currently.
   - Will discuss with IP.
   - Consider thoracics input as above if concerned re: infection.
   .
   # Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Causing L hilar fullness on CXR,
   splicing of carina as well.  More concerning for malignancy as cause,
   but could also be reactive if infection present.
   - Management of mass as above.
   .
   # Anemia. Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
   Reticulocyte index 0.4 consistent with marrow suppression. Folate/B12
   normal
   - Guiaic stools.
   - Check Fe studies, TSH, B12, folate, retics.
   - T&S and will cross 2 units as going to OR possible.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Infectious vs. reactive to other process.  Infectious
   etiologies include post obstructive/aspiration pneumonia, urine, blood,
   GI source.
   - send sputum.
   - blood cultures.
   - UA.
   - Antibiotics as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with no prior medical history, who presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea. She has been intubated and admitted to the MICU for further management of right lung and vocal cord masses. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy planned. Her vital signs are stable, but she has leukocytosis and anemia. There are several potential complications to consider, including respiratory failure due to large airway obstruction from the vocal cord mass, collapsed right lower lobe of the lung, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Other conditions to monitor include a possible pleural effusion and anemia of chronic inflammation. The patient is also on prophylactic antibiotics and heparin. Disposition is pending clinical improvement in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with no past medical history, who presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management of right lung and vocal cord masses. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to a large airway obstruction caused by the vocal cord mass. The differential diagnosis for the vocal cord mass includes cancer, benign polyp, abscess, or hematoma. The next step in management is to attempt at ENT/surgical resection or proceed with tracheostomy. The patient also has a right lung mass, which could be due to malignancy, abscess/necrotizing pneumonia, or sequestration. Bronchoscopy and biopsy were performed, but the results are unclear. The patient is being treated empirically for necrotizing pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is due to visualization of the cord mass and significant primary lung pathology. She will be maintained intubated on vent until tracheostomy or definitive management of the vocal cord mass. The patient also has anemia, leukocytosis, and right pleural effusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction: The vocal cord mass can cause airway obstruction, which may worsen and lead to respiratory distress or failure.
2. Infection: The patient is being treated empirically for necrotizing pneumonia, and there is a risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of smoking and COPD, who was transferred to the ICU for management of a vocal cord mass and right lower lobe mass. She is currently intubated with an 7.0 ETT, and there is no cuff leak. The patient is critically ill, and her airway obstruction is central or upper. The medical team is coordinating with IP, thoracics, and ENT for securing the airway, likely through tracheostomy and excision of the vocal cord mass. They also plan to sample mediastinal lymph nodes and obtain a neck CT with contrast. The patient's current ventilator settings will be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction due to the vocal cord mass and RLL mass.
2. Respiratory failure secondary to the inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
5. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to critical illness and steroid use.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.
7. Sepsis and septic shock due to infection and compromised immune system.
8. Cardiac complications, such as"

   Bottom line - despite a good effort to get things done, no real
   progress was made yesterday:
   - OSH pathology has not taken a look at the slides; will anticipate
   doing so tomorrow [**12-9**] and will fax us with their findings.
   - Echo showed EF > 55%, pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined, otherwise overall unremarkable.
   - LENI showed no evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
   - IP did not remove OSH RIJ, put in a new IJ or arterial line.
   - PICC line requested to be placed.
   - Arterial line placed.
   - Need to discuss about RIJ today.
   - ENT recommends steroids, return to OR in 2 days with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10510**] to perform repeat direct laryngoscopy and possible
   biopsy, CT neck with contrast (ordered).
   - IP notes the following plan: The patient will be given a course of
   Decadron for 48 hours and then we will return back to the operating
   room with ENT and Thoracic Surgery for evaluation of the vocal cords
   and possible change of the ET tube to a larger size followed by
   endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration. If the
   vocal cords continue to reveal significant edema despite Decadron
   treatment, then we might consider tracheostomy tube plus
   mediastinoscopy for further work-up of the patient's lesions.
   - Desaturated after returning to floor from OR; stat CXR showed
   continued opacification at the right base consistent with atelectasis
   and effusion. Abundant mucous suctioned with improved saturation.
   - Discontinued heparin SC due to IP concern about bloody secretion;
   will need to follow up with IP regarding when can restart

   Assessment and Plan
 AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, CENTRAL / UPPER
   76F with no PMH, longtime smoker, presenting with shortness of breath,
   chest pain, and nausea, now transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for further
   management of right lung and vocal cord masses.
   # Vocal cord mass
   Not clearly visualized on preliminary read of neck CT. Seen by ENT on
   endoscopy but no biopsy taken. They suggest steroids for 2 d then
   biopsy. Differential includes cancer (squamous cell cancer or
   metastatic), benign polyp, abscess, hematoma. Polyposis also correlates
   with squamous lung cancer. Mass was biopsied at OSH but slides not yet
   reviewed by their pathologist - they will fax today.  Main question
   relates to management of large airway obstruction. For now airway
   secure after placement of ETT. Next approach to take - attempt at
   ENT/surgical resection vs. proceeding with tracheostomy with subsequent
   addressing of mass. Able to pass 7.0 tube, but no leak when cuff down.
   Will follow after steroids given. Symptomatic with dyspnea and gagging
   for at least a month per family.
   - ENT and IP following.
   - Back to OR on Friday after steroids.
   - Restart diet and then NPO after midnight Thursday
   - Maintain ETT in place
   - Followup path from OSH; attempt to obtain tissue samples for [**Hospital1 **] path
   review (they are supposed to fax today)
   # R lung mass
   Review of OSH CT here suggesting entire RLL collapsed, but complicated
   with ?fluid and gas vs. minimal airway patency.  Differential includes
   malignancy (primary or metastatic), abscess/necrotizing pneumonia (from
   aspiration or post obstructive), sequestration. From endoscopy (IP's)
   sounds like mass. Seems to be having some bleeding from endotracheal
   suctioning, likely from biopsy today (ENT suggested holding heparin for
   now).
   - Hold heparin, but discuss given likely hypercoagulable state.
   - Rebronch with ENT on Friday for biopsy after steroids
   - Consider thoracics consult if/when appropriate (D/w IP)
   - Followup and obtain path as above.
   - Discuss ABx (Treat empirically for necrotizing pneumonia - clinda and
   ceftriaxone to start; consider better MRSA and/or atypical coverage if
   not improving; tailor abx based on culture data).
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated in setting of visualization of cord mass as above, but also
   has significant primary lung pathology (baseline emphysematous changes,
   RLL collapse/mass).
   - Maintain intubated on vent until trach or definitive management of
   vocal cord mass.  Hope for early liberation from vent if trach pursued.
   - Goal pCO2 around 50-60
   # R pleural effusion.  Malignant vs. parapneumonic vs. simple
   transudative.  Too small on imaging to sample currently. Not sampled on
   endoscopy. Likely malignant given appearance of mass on endoscopy.
   # Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Causing L hilar fullness on CXR,
   splicing of carina as well.  More concerning for malignancy as cause,
   but could also be reactive if infection present.
   - Management of mass as above.
   # Anemia. Chronic inflammation/disease picture. - Guiaic stools.
   - Check.
   - Follow
   - Transfusion goal 21 or if symptomatic at this time.
   - T&S and will cross 2 units as going to OR Friday.
   -------------------------
   # Leukocytosis.  Infectious vs. reactive to other process.  Infectious
   etiologies include post obstructive/aspiration pneumonia, urine, blood,
   GI source.
   - send sputum.
   - blood cultures.
   - UA.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO in case of procedure tomorrow.
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2B.
   # Access: RIJ placed at OSH (remove by tomorrow) - resite vs.
   peripherals only.
   # Communication: Husband, children.
   # [**Name2 (NI) 129**]:  Full (discussed with husband)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management of right lung and vocal cord masses. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The assessment and plan section of the note includes several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Airway obstruction, central/upper: The patient has a vocal cord mass that is causing airway obstruction. The mass was biopsied, but slides have not yet been reviewed by the pathologist. The main question relates to the management of the large airway obstruction. The plan is to attempt ENT/surgical resection or proceed with tracheostomy and subsequent addressing of the mass after giving steroids. 

2. Right lung mass: The patient has a collapsed right lower lobe (RLL) with possible fluid and gas, which could be due to malignancy, abscess/necrotizing pneumonia, or sequestration. The plan is to hold heparin, rebronchoscopically biopsy with ENT on Friday after steroids, consider thoracic consult if appropriate, follow up and obtain pathology, and discuss antibiotics.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to visualization of the cord mass and significant primary lung pathology. The goal is to maintain intub"

   Bottom line - despite a good effort to get things done, no real
   progress was made yesterday:
   - OSH pathology has not taken a look at the slides; will anticipate
   doing so tomorrow [**12-9**] and will fax us with their findings.
   - Echo showed EF > 55%, pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined, otherwise overall unremarkable.
   - LENI showed no evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
   - IP did not remove OSH RIJ, put in a new IJ or arterial line.
   - PICC line requested to be placed.
   - Arterial line placed.
   - Need to discuss about RIJ today.
   - ENT recommends steroids, return to OR in 2 days with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10510**] to perform repeat direct laryngoscopy and possible
   biopsy, CT neck with contrast (ordered).
   - IP notes the following plan: The patient will be given a course of
   Decadron for 48 hours and then we will return back to the operating
   room with ENT and Thoracic Surgery for evaluation of the vocal cords
   and possible change of the ET tube to a larger size followed by
   endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration. If the
   vocal cords continue to reveal significant edema despite Decadron
   treatment, then we might consider tracheostomy tube plus
   mediastinoscopy for further work-up of the patient's lesions.
   - Desaturated after returning to floor from OR; stat CXR showed
   continued opacification at the right base consistent with atelectasis
   and effusion. Abundant mucous suctioned with improved saturation.
   - Discontinued heparin SC due to IP concern about bloody secretion;
   will need to follow up with IP regarding when can restart

   Assessment and Plan
 AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, CENTRAL / UPPER
   76F with no PMH, longtime smoker, presenting with shortness of breath,
   chest pain, and nausea, now transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for further
   management of right lung and vocal cord masses.
   # Vocal cord mass
   Not clearly visualized on preliminary read of neck CT. Seen by ENT on
   endoscopy but no biopsy taken. They suggest steroids for 2 d then
   biopsy. Differential includes cancer (squamous cell cancer or
   metastatic), benign polyp, abscess, hematoma. Polyposis also correlates
   with squamous lung cancer. Mass was biopsied at OSH but slides not yet
   reviewed by their pathologist - they will fax today.  Main question
   relates to management of large airway obstruction. For now airway
   secure after placement of ETT. Next approach to take - attempt at
   ENT/surgical resection vs. proceeding with tracheostomy with subsequent
   addressing of mass. Able to pass 7.0 tube, but no leak when cuff down.
   Will follow after steroids given. Symptomatic with dyspnea and gagging
   for at least a month per family.
   - ENT and IP following.
   - Back to OR on Friday after steroids.
   - Restart diet and then NPO after midnight Thursday
   - Maintain ETT in place
   - Followup path from OSH; attempt to obtain tissue samples for [**Hospital1 **] path
   review (they are supposed to fax today)
   # R lung mass
   Review of OSH CT here suggesting entire RLL collapsed, but complicated
   with ?fluid and gas vs. minimal airway patency.  Differential includes
   malignancy (primary or metastatic), abscess/necrotizing pneumonia (from
   aspiration or post obstructive), sequestration. From endoscopy (IP's)
   sounds like mass. Seems to be having some bleeding from endotracheal
   suctioning, likely from biopsy today (ENT suggested holding heparin for
   now).
   - Hold heparin, but discuss given likely hypercoagulable state.
   - Rebronch with ENT on Friday for biopsy after steroids
   - Consider thoracics consult if/when appropriate (D/w IP)
   - Followup and obtain path as above.
   - Discuss ABx (Treat empirically for necrotizing pneumonia - clinda and
   ceftriaxone to start; consider better MRSA and/or atypical coverage if
   not improving; tailor abx based on culture data).
   -----------------------------
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated in setting of visualization of cord mass as above, but also
   has significant primary lung pathology (baseline emphysematous changes,
   RLL collapse/mass).
   - Maintain intubated on vent until trach or definitive management of
   vocal cord mass.  Hope for early liberation from vent if trach pursued.
   - Patient with baseline chronic respiratory acidosis vs. metabolic
   alkalosis from vomiting; attempt to maintain CO2s in high 40s/low 50s
   (decrease current minute vents).
   - Decrease respiratory rate to 16 breaths/minute to increase pC02 and
   maintain slight acidosis.
   - MDIs for management of bronchospasm if present.
   # R pleural effusion.  Malignant vs. parapneumonic vs. simple
   transudative.  Too small on imaging to sample currently.
   - Will discuss with IP.
   - Consider thoracics input as above if concerned re: infection.
   # Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Causing L hilar fullness on CXR,
   splicing of carina as well.  More concerning for malignancy as cause,
   but could also be reactive if infection present.
   - Management of mass as above.
   # Anemia. Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
   Reticulocyte index 0.4 consistent with marrow suppression. Folate/B12
   normal
   - Guiaic stools.
   - Check Fe studies, TSH, B12, folate, retics.
   - T&S and will cross 2 units as going to OR possible.
   # Leukocytosis.  Infectious vs. reactive to other process.  Infectious
   etiologies include post obstructive/aspiration pneumonia, urine, blood,
   GI source.
   - send sputum.
   - blood cultures.
   - UA.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO in case of procedure tomorrow.
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2B.
   # Access: RIJ placed at OSH (remove by tomorrow) - resite vs.
   peripherals only.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with no prior medical history, who is a longtime smoker. She presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea, and was transferred to the ICU for further management of right lung and vocal cord masses. The patient underwent an ultrasound, echo, and OR SENT procedure. An arterial line was started, and a PICC line was requested. The patient's plan includes a course of Decadron for 48 hours followed by a repeat direct laryngoscopy and possible biopsy, CT neck with contrast (ordered). If the vocal cords continue to reveal significant edema despite Decadron treatment, tracheostomy tube and mediastinoscopy may be considered for further work-up of the patient's lesions. The patient also has atelectasis and effusion, as shown by a stat CXR. The patient's allergies include Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction due to vocal cord mass and collapsed right lung.
2. Respiratory failure due to severe airway obstruction and underlying chronic respiratory condition.
3. Pleural effusion, possibly malignant, parapneumonic, or transudative.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy causing hilar fullness and concern for malignancy.
5. Anemia of chronic inflammation with reticulocyte index consistent with marrow suppression.
6. Leukocytosis, potentially due to infection or"

   Bottom line - despite a good effort to get things done, no real
   progress was made yesterday:
   - OSH pathology has not taken a look at the slides; will anticipate
   doing so tomorrow [**12-9**] and will fax us with their findings.
   - Echo showed EF > 55%, pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined, otherwise overall unremarkable.
   - LENI showed no evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
   - IP did not remove OSH RIJ, put in a new IJ or arterial line.
   - PICC line requested to be placed.
   - Arterial line placed.
   - Need to discuss about RIJ today.
   - ENT recommends steroids, return to OR in 2 days with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10510**] to perform repeat direct laryngoscopy and possible
   biopsy, CT neck with contrast (ordered).
   - IP notes the following plan: The patient will be given a course of
   Decadron for 48 hours and then we will return back to the operating
   room with ENT and Thoracic Surgery for evaluation of the vocal cords
   and possible change of the ET tube to a larger size followed by
   endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration. If the
   vocal cords continue to reveal significant edema despite Decadron
   treatment, then we might consider tracheostomy tube plus
   mediastinoscopy for further work-up of the patient's lesions.
   - Desaturated after returning to floor from OR; stat CXR showed
   continued opacification at the right base consistent with atelectasis
   and effusion. Abundant mucous suctioned with improved saturation.
   - Discontinued heparin SC due to IP concern about bloody secretion;
   will need to follow up with IP regarding when can restart

 AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, CENTRAL / UPPER
   76F with no PMH, longtime smoker, presenting with shortness of breath,
   chest pain, and nausea, now transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for further
   management of right lung and vocal cord masses.
   # Sedation, Ventilation and Airway
   Increased sedation for PICC to propofol 15, then back to 10. Needed to
   maintain due to lots of coughing and desynchrony. Now comfortable and
   lightly sedated
 arousable and able to answer questions. Ventilator
   aim to provide some PEEP around 10 cmH2O given small lumen ETT and
   intrinsic resistance. Maintain for now given possibility of upper
   airway obstruction. To OR on Friday and receiving steroids to possibly
   increase airway lumen. Likely also some LRT infection in context of
   airway collapse (see below)
   - Maintain light sedation at propofol 10
   - Ventilate with pressure support with PEEP 10 cmH2O for now
   - Goal CO2 around 50 - 60 mmHg ppCO2
   # Vocal cord mass
   Not clearly visualized on preliminary read of neck CT. Seen by ENT on
   endoscopy but no biopsy taken. They suggest steroids for 2 d then
   biopsy. Differential includes cancer (squamous cell cancer or
   metastatic), benign polyp, abscess, hematoma. Polyposis also correlates
   with squamous lung cancer. Mass was biopsied at OSH but slides not yet
   reviewed by their pathologist - they will fax today.  Main question
   relates to management of large airway obstruction. For now airway
   secure after placement of ETT. Next approach to take - attempt at
   ENT/surgical resection vs. proceeding with tracheostomy with subsequent
   addressing of mass. Able to pass 7.0 tube, but no leak when cuff down.
   Will follow after steroids given. Symptomatic with dyspnea and gagging
   for at least a month per family.

   - Back to OR on Friday after steroids.
   - Restart diet and then NPO after midnight tonight
   - Maintain ETT in place
   - Followup path from OSH; attempt to obtain tissue samples for [**Hospital1 **] path

   # Right Lung Mass, possible LRTI and Effusion
   Review of OSH CT here suggesting entire RLL collapsed, but complicated
   with ?fluid and gas vs. minimal airway patency.  Differential includes
   malignancy (primary or metastatic), abscess/necrotizing pneumonia (from
   aspiration or post obstructive), sequestration. From endoscopy (IP's)
   sounds like mass. Seems to be having some bleeding from endotracheal
   suctioning, likely from biopsy today (ENT suggested holding heparin for
   now). Effusion is malignant versus infectious in context of collapse.
   - Hold heparin, but discuss given likely hypercoagulable state.
   - Rebronch with ENT on Friday for biopsy after steroids
   - Followup and obtain path as above.
   - Treat empirically for necrotizing pneumonia for now given
   multi-density appearance on CT- clinda and ceftriaxone. Continue until
   more information from specimens on Friday or resulting culture data.
   # Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy
   Secondary to above processes
 mass with nodal spread, versus secondary
   to infection.
   # Anemia. Chronic inflammation/disease picture
   # Leukocytosis
   Now within normal range in context of antibiotics. Will likely increase

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD and long-term smoking. He presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea and was transferred to the MICU for further management of right lung and vocal cord masses. The patient underwent several diagnostic procedures including ultrasound, ECHO, and CT neck. 

The patient's condition remains stable but challenging. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support and PEEP 10 cmH2O. The goal CO2 is around 50-60 mmHg ppCO2. The patient is lightly sedated with propofol 10. 

The assessment and plan include airway obstruction, vocal cord mass, right lung mass, possible lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 121/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, and mildly elevated liver enzymes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of smoking and COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for the management of vocal cord mass and RLL mass. She is intubated with a 7.0 ETT and has been receiving steroids, mechanical ventilation, and antibiotics (clindamycin and ceftriaxone). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 129/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, but within normal limits. Imaging reveals a subglottic lesion, which is not well seen on CT neck. The patient's airway obstruction is managed with intubation and ventilation settings switched to PSV. The plan is to take her back to the OR tomorrow with IP/thoracics/ENT team for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction due to vocal cord mass and RLL mass.
2. Respiratory failure secondary to severe COPD and mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection (suggested by elevated white blood cell count) due to prolonged intubation and immunocompromised state.
4. Pressure ulcers from prolonged bed rest and immobility.
5. Deep vein thrombosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with no PMH, longtime smoker, presenting with shortness of breath,
   chest pain, and nausea, now transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for further
   management of right lung and vocal cord masses.
   # Sedation, Ventilation and Airway
   Increased sedation for PICC to propofol 15, then back to 10. Needed to
   maintain due to lots of coughing and desynchrony. Now comfortable and
   lightly sedated
 arousable and able to answer questions. Ventilator
   aim to provide some PEEP around 10 cmH2O given small lumen ETT and
   intrinsic resistance. Maintain for now given possibility of upper
   airway obstruction. To OR on Friday and receiving steroids to possibly
   increase airway lumen. Likely also some LRT infection in context of
   airway collapse (see below)
   - Maintain light sedation at propofol 10
   - Ventilate with pressure support with PEEP 10 cmH2O for now
   - Goal CO2 around 50 - 60 mmHg ppCO2
   # Vocal cord mass
   Not clearly visualized on preliminary read of neck CT. Seen by ENT on
   endoscopy but no biopsy taken. They suggest steroids for 2 d then
   biopsy. Differential includes cancer (squamous cell cancer or
   metastatic), benign polyp, abscess, hematoma. Polyposis also correlates
   with squamous lung cancer. Mass was biopsied at OSH but slides not yet
   reviewed by their pathologist - they will fax today.  Main question
   relates to management of large airway obstruction. For now airway
   secure after placement of ETT. Next approach to take - attempt at
   ENT/surgical resection vs. proceeding with tracheostomy with subsequent
   addressing of mass. Able to pass 7.0 tube, but no leak when cuff down.
   Will follow after steroids given. Symptomatic with dyspnea and gagging
   for at least a month per family.
   - ENT and IP following.
   - Back to OR on Friday after steroids.
   - Restart diet and then NPO after midnight tonight
   - Maintain ETT in place
   - Followup path from OSH; attempt to obtain tissue samples for [**Hospital1 **] path
   review (they are supposed to fax today)
   # Right Lung Mass, possible LRTI and Effusion
   Review of OSH CT here suggesting entire RLL collapsed, but complicated
   with ?fluid and gas vs. minimal airway patency.  Differential includes
   malignancy (primary or metastatic), abscess/necrotizing pneumonia (from
   aspiration or post obstructive), sequestration. From endoscopy (IP's)
   sounds like mass. Seems to be having some bleeding from endotracheal
   suctioning, likely from biopsy today (ENT suggested holding heparin for
   now). Effusion is malignant versus infectious in context of collapse.
   - Hold heparin, but discuss given likely hypercoagulable state.
   - Rebronch with ENT on Friday for biopsy after steroids
   - Followup and obtain path as above.
   - Treat empirically for necrotizing pneumonia for now given
   multi-density appearance on CT- clinda and ceftriaxone. Continue until
   more information from specimens on Friday or resulting culture data.
   # Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy
   Secondary to above processes
 mass with nodal spread, versus secondary
   to infection.
   # Anemia. Chronic inflammation/disease picture
   # Leukocytosis
   Now within normal range in context of antibiotics. Will likely increase
   again now given steroids.
   - Follow culture results and culture further if indicated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of long-term smoking. She presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea and was transferred to the ICU for further management of right lung and vocal cord masses.

The patient has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, steroids, and antibiotics. She is currently intubated and sedated, but arousable and able to answer questions. The ventilator settings include pressure support with PEEP of 10 cmH2O, aiming to maintain a CO2 level around 50-60 mmHg.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case:

1. Airway obstruction: The patient has a large airway obstruction due to the vocal cord mass. This can lead to further respiratory distress and difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The planned approach is to secure the airway with an endotracheal tube, followed by an attempt at ENT/surgical resection or a tracheostomy.

2. Lung infection: The patient's right lung is collapsed, which may be due to pneumonia or an abscess. This increases the risk of lung infection and the need for appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient is already receiving empirical coverage with clindamycin and ceftriaxone.

3. Effusion: The presence of an effusion raises the possibility of malignancy or an infectious process. It is important to determine the nature of the eff"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of long-term smoking, presenting with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management of right lung and vocal cord masses. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and PEEP 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 43 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/51 mmHg to 146/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient underwent a tracheostomy and received steroids in the morning. She received a 500 cc bolus with low urine output in the afternoon and 1L LR at 100 in the evening. The patient has an allergy to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics). 

Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the presence of laryngeal and right middle lobe masses. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. 

Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and CT scan, are pending. Microbiology reports indicate the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and rare growth of commensal respiratory flora.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of smoking, who was admitted to the ICU for management of a vocal cord mass and right lower lobe mass. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has undergone several procedures including bronchoscopic biopsy, imaging studies, and blood tests. Her condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction: Given the presence of a vocal cord mass and previous attempts at extubation, there is a risk of airway obstruction during extubation or if the mass causes further swelling.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may be compromised due to the vocal cord mass and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: As the patient is critically ill and intubated, she is at an increased risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other infections.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding (evidenced by a high INR) and may be at risk for bleeding complications if invasive procedures are required.
5. Cardiovascular issues: Hypotension and potential fluid shifts due to the presence of edema in the lower extremities could indicate underlying cardiovascular problems.
6. Metabolic disturbances: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, indicating a need for close monitoring and management of glycemic control.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, infection risks, coagulation profile, cardiovascular function"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of smoking and COPD, admitted to the ICU for management of vocal cord mass and right lower lobe (RLL) mass.
- She is currently intubated with a 7.0 ETT and receiving medical treatment including Decadron and antibiotics.
- The vocal cord lesion could not be readily visualized, and an EBUS-guided biopsy of the 11L and 7 lymph nodes was performed.
- The patient's condition remains critical, and plans for extubation will be made once she is more awake with anesthesia backup arranged.
- Her labs show normal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelets, but slightly elevated levels of creatinine and troponin T.
- She has been on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support system and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction: Given the vocal cord mass and previous unsuccessful attempts at visualization, there is a risk of ongoing or worsening airway obstruction, which could compromise the patient's ability to breathe.
2. Infection: The presence of atypical squamous cells in the pathology results from the RLL biopsy suggests a potential underlying infection or malignancy. The patient is currently receiving antibiotic treatment, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent or manage any infections.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's critical condition and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for management of a vocal cord mass and right lower lobe (RLL) mass. The patient is currently intubated with a 7.0 endotracheal tube (ETT), and there is no cuff leak.

The patient received two days of dexamethasone (Decadron) and is scheduled for an operation today to reassess the vocal cord mass and consider possible tracheostomy. The ventilator settings need to be adjusted, and the results of the pathology from outside hospital should be followed up.

The patient is also on continuous clindamycin (CTX) and ceftriaxone. The rest of the issues are being managed by the ICU team.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control, and various lines including an arterial line, PICC line, and a recently placed 18-gauge line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with no past medical history, who presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea. She has been intubated and sedated, and is currently in the ICU for further management of right lung and vocal cord masses. The preliminary pathology report suggests lung concerning for squamous cell carcinoma and laryngeal mass less concerning for malignancy. The patient's urine output has been low, and she has been given a liter bolus without improvement. A Foley flush and bladder scan were performed, revealing no urine in the bladder. The patient complained of chest and periumbilical pain during the afternoon, for which fentanyl IV was started. The EKG showed no ST-T wave changes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 39 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/64 mmHg to 177/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Imaging studies including a chest X-ray and cultures have been pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's intubation and sedation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Infection:"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Complications:
- The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, indicating a respiratory failure or severe respiratory distress.
- There is a concern for squamous cell carcinoma in the larynx, which may further compromise the patient's respiratory function.
- Bloody secretions suctioned from the NG tube suggest possible bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or respiratory system.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
- The patient's blood pressure is elevated, with readings ranging from 154/64 mmHg to 177/86 mmHg.
- The presence of a right lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy raises the possibility of cardiac involvement or compression of the heart by the mass.

3. Infection:
- The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone) due to suspected necrotizing pneumonia.
- The sputum culture showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci in pairs, which may indicate a bacterial infection.
- The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which can be a sign of infection.

4. Anemia:
- The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, indicating anemia.
- Chronic inflammation or disease, possibly related to the underlying malignancy, could be contributing to the anemia.

5. Other Complications:
- The patient's urine"

   24 Hour Events:
   - OR today: Biopsies in the OR of Subcarinal LN And Lymph Nodes from
   the left mediastinal.
   - ENT Recs/IP Recs: Extubation in AM. After extubation will get better
   visualization of laryngeal mass.
   - Urine Output low sp OR. Bolused one liter wihtout improvement. Foley
   flushed. Bladder scan without urine in bladder.
   - Complained of some chest/periumbilical pain with coughing during the
   afternoon. Started Fentanyl IV. EKG: Without ST-T wave changes.
   - Preliminary path at OSH: Lung concerning for squamous cell carcinoma,
   laryngeal mass less concerning for malignancy.
   - Bloody secretions suctioned from NG tube early this AM.

   # Ventilation and Airway
   No cuff leak with balloon down, concerning.  Bloody secretions are
   concerning, however appear mild.
   - Discuss OR extubation with ENT/IP today
   - Ventilate with pressure support with PEEP 10 cmH2O for now
   - Goal CO2 around 50 - 60 mmHg ppCO2
   - Extubate today in OR?
   - Continue Dexamethasone, defer length of therapy to ENT/IP

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with no past medical history, who presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further management of right lung and vocal cord masses. The patient has been diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in the right lung and a possible laryngeal mass. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate ranging from 39-86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/64 to 177/86 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 10-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is sedated but arousable.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. The blood glucose levels are within normal range. The electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium, are also within normal limits. The liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving several medications, including midazolam, morphine sulfate, famotidine, heparin sodium, and fentanyl.

Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray and CT scan, are pending. The sputum culture shows the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs, while the respiratory culture shows sparse growth of beta streptococci.

The patient's assessment and plan include ventilation"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of tobacco abuse. She was admitted to the ICU for management of vocal cord and bronchus intermedius masses. The patient underwent an operation where mediastinal nodes were sampled. She remains intubated for airway protection but her airway appears improved. The plan is to extubate her in the morning with anesthesia present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction: The patient's vocal cord mass may cause obstruction of the airway, leading to respiratory distress or failure.
2. Ventilation and airway issues: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there are concerns about extubation due to her inability to vocalize and the presence of bloody secretions.
3. Infection: The patient is being treated empirically for necrotizing pneumonia due to the multi-density appearance on the CT scan. She has been on antibiotics (clindamycin and ceftriaxone), but there is a concern for ongoing infection.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: The patient has mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which could be secondary to the lung masses or an infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to chronic inflammation or disease.
6. Hypercoagulable state: The patient may have a hypercoagulable state, especially considering the presence of a lung mass. Heparin"

   76F with no PMH, longtime smoker, presenting with shortness of breath,
   chest pain, and nausea, now transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for further
   management of right lung and vocal cord masses.
   # Ventilation and Airway
   Plan for extubation today on hold with no leak with cuff down and pt
   unable to vocalize. Bloody secretions are concerning, however appear
   mild.
   - Continue nasal cannula
   - Stop dexamethasone, if agreeable to ENT/IP
   # Right Lung Mass, possible LRTI and Effusion
   Likely squamous given pathology and report with airway collapse and
   LRTI.
   - Restart heparin
   - Treat empirically for necrotizing pneumonia for now given
   multi-density appearance on CT- clinda and ceftriaxone. Continue until
   more information from specimens on Friday or resulting culture data.
   # Vocal cord mass
   Likely benign polyp, given OSH [**Location (un) 103**]. Thus, relationship to lung
   disease: Polyposis correlates with squamous cancer. Other
   possibilities: Discrete processes, metastases need to be entertained.
   - Restart Diet
   - Obtain tissue samples for [**Hospital1 **] pathology to review
   - Determine if resection necessary with IP, Sp&Sw, patient comfort.
   # Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy
   Likely secondary to above process.
   - Await results
   # Hypertension
   - Start lisinopril 5 mg QD today
   # Bradycardia and hyponea
   Unclear significance. Doesn

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with no prior medical history, who has been a longtime smoker. She presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea. She was transferred to the MICU for further management of her right lung and vocal cord masses. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated during the afternoon. ENT recommendations were not available when checked at 1800. Pathology/cytology from Hospital1 was also not available at 2100. The patient had some anxiety and was given her home dose of Ambien. On the next morning, she exhibited bradycardia in the 20s with agonal breathing that remitted spontaneously upon waking.

On December 10th, the patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy through an endotracheal tube and an endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration of lymph node stations 11L and 7. Pathology from OSH reported that the lung lesion is squamous, while the supralaryngeal lesion is thought to be benign.

The patient has allergies to sulfa medications and an unknown allergy. She received antibiotics, including Clindamycin on December 11th and Ceftriaxone on December 12th. The patient was given various infusions and other ICU medications, such as Fentanyl, Famotidine, and"

","The patient presented to the hospital with a supralaryngeal mass impinging on the airway and a right lung mass. The patient required invasive ventilation and was successfully extubated during the afternoon. ENT recommendations were not available when checked at 1800, and pathology/cytology from Hospital 1 was not received by 2100.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) increased from 26.9% in the morning to 28.9% in the evening. The patient experienced some anxiety and was given their home dose of Ambien for sleep at night. On the morning of 12-12, the patient was very bradycardic with a heart rate in the 20s and had agonal breathing that resolved spontaneously upon waking.

On 12-10, the patient underwent flexible bronchoscopy through an endotracheal tube and endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration of lymph node stations 11L and 7. The pathology of the lung lesion was identified as squamous, and the supralaryngeal lesion was thought to be benign.

The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and an unknown allergy. The last doses of antibiotics administered were clindamycin on 12-11 at 08:00 PM and ceftriaxone on 12-12 at 12:01 AM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl, fam"

   76F with no PMH, longtime smoker, presenting with shortness of breath,
   chest pain, and nausea, now transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for further
   management of right lung and vocal cord masses.
   # Ventilation and Airway
   Plan for extubation today on hold with no leak with cuff down and pt
   unable to vocalize. Bloody secretions are concerning, however appear
   mild.
   - Continue nasal cannula
   - Stop dexamethasone, if agreeable to ENT/IP
   # Right Lung Mass, possible LRTI and Effusion
   Likely squamous given pathology and report with airway collapse and
   LRTI.
   - Restart heparin
   - Treat empirically for necrotizing pneumonia for now given
   multi-density appearance on CT- clinda and ceftriaxone. Continue until
   more information from specimens on Friday or resulting culture data.
   -
   # Vocal cord mass
   Likely benign polyp, given OSH [**Location (un) 103**]. Thus, relationship to lung
   disease: Polyposis correlates with squamous cancer. Other
   possibilities: Discrete processes, metastases need to be entertained.
   - Restart Diet
   - Obtain tissue samples for [**Hospital1 **] pathology to review
   - Determine if resection necessary with IP, Sp&Sw, patient comfort.
   # Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy
   Likely secondary to above process.
   - Await results
   # Bradycardia and hyponea.

   Assessment and Plan
 AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, CENTRAL / UPPER
   76F with no PMH, longtime smoker, presenting with shortness of breath,
   chest pain, and nausea, now transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for further
   management of right lung and vocal cord masses.
   # Ventilation and Airway
   Extubated successfully
   - Continue Dexamethasone, defer length of therapy to ENT/IP
   # Vocal cord mass
   Appears to be a benign polyp.
   - Restart Diet
   - FU path from [**Hospital1 1**]
   - Followup path from OSH; attempt to obtain tissue samples for [**Hospital1 **] path
   review (they are supposed to fax today)
   - Social Work Consult re: Family coping for potential new diagnosis.
   # Right Lung Mass, possible LRTI and Effusion
   Concerning for Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Preliminary path points toward
   squamous cell carcinoma.
   - Treat empirically for necrotizing post-obstructive pneumonia for now
   given multi-density appearance on CT- clinda and ceftriaxone.
   # Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy
    Secondary to above processes
 mass with nodal spread, versus
   secondary to infection. Awaiting path
    # Anemia. Chronic inflammation/disease picture
   # HBP -Start on low dose ACE, titrate as needed on floor
    # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO in case of procedure
   tomorrow.
    # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2B.

","The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of lung and vocal cord masses, who was admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea. She was previously intubated and successfully extubated in the ICU. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 166/70 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. 

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for bradycardia during sleep, which resolved with awakening. 

Physical examination reveals well-nourished general appearance, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, neck supple, and respiratory chest with diminished breath sounds on the right base and scattered rhonchi. 

Laboratory results show normal WBC, Hct, and Plt levels, with slightly elevated Cr, TCO2, glucose, and LDH levels. Imaging studies show an unchanged chest X-ray. 

The patient has been diagnosed with airway obstruction due to a vocal cord mass and right lung mass, which appears to be a benign polyp. The right lung mass is concerning for squamous cell carcinoma. 

The plan includes continuing dexamethasone therapy, restarting diet, following up with pathology from Hospital 11, attempting to obtain tissue samples for Hospital"
