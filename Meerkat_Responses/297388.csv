   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o male with known severe PVD, DM, severe AS, CHF, LLE
   gangrene, transferred to CCU for monitored diuresis for acute on
   chronic systolic CHF.
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF - Ischemic and also may be related to
   aortic stenosis. Appears now evoluemic, cr inc from 1.1 to 1.7 today.
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - reasses fluid status in evening IV bolus lasix prn for goal i/o even
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - Holding spironolactone and digoxin
   # Aortic stenosis -
   - Plan for AVR Monday with CABD
   - Goal INR 1.3 for OR, give Vitamin K as needed
   - Diuresis to optimize for OR.
   - Carotid ultrasounds and dental x-rays complete
   #. CAD-Cath [**2157-1-20**] with multivessel CAD. PT needs AVR & CABG. C-[**Doctor First Name **]
   planning for OR tomorrow. Had trop leak [**1-24**] CHF.  Has ICD in place.
   -ASA/BB/Statin
   -avoid nitrates for CP given AS.
   -f/u Csurg recs, d/w them whether ICD needs to be deactivated prior to
   surgery and who will do this (? EP)
   #. Rhythm - Pt with AFib. HR controlled on metoprolol.
   -holding digoxin as rate is controlled with metoprolol
   -on hep gtt; holding warfarin pending OR.
   #Diabetes. On Insulin as outpt. A1C is 6.0.
   -[**Last Name (un) 294**] consult appreciated.
   -DM diet
   -ISS
   # Severe PVD/Dry Gangrene - Plan for revascularization after cardiac
   issues addressed.
   - ID consult appreciated.
   - vancomycin 1gm Q12hr, cipro PO, flagyl PO, now day 13, d/c abx today,
   as would complete 2-week course.
   - wound care per vascular.
   # Acute Renal failure - Cr. improving increased with dieuresis, at
   baseline 1.2. Inital injury [**1-24**] poor forward flow and resolved with
   diuresis. Now worsened with likely over diuresis.
   - holding lasix for now given Cr bump.
   # Anemia - Hct at baseline (low 30s)
   - cont to monitor.
   # Depression - continue Celexa.
   # PMR - continue hydrocortisone, ? stress does steroids peri-op
   # FEN: Follow and replete electrolytes. Cardiac diet.  NPO after MN
   # Access: PIV
   # PPx: PO diet. heparin gtt. bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), severe aortic stenosis (AS), congestive heart failure (CHF), and left lower extremity (LE) gangrene. He was transferred to the CCU for monitored diuresis due to acute on chronic systolic CHF. The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypotension with a systolic blood pressure of 74 mmHg, which responded well to normal saline (NS) bolus x2, suggesting hypovolemia from overdiuresis.
- NPO after Monday's planned aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
- Taking Prednisone 5mg at home, so stress-dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100mg IV) will be administered tomorrow in the morning, x3 doses.
- No known drug allergies.
- Last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin and metronidazole on January 23rd.
- Infusions include heparin sodium at 1,000 units/hour.
- Other ICU medications and flowsheet data are also mentioned.
- Vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax: 36.7Â°C), heart rate (HR: 73 bpm), blood pressure (BP: 113/55 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR: 23 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation (SpO2: 93%), and atrial fibrillation (AF) with a heart rhythm.
- The patient's weight is 82.2 kg, and height is 70 inches.
- Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,501 mL (including 55 mL of IV fluids), output of 1,920 mL (including 400 mL of urine), and negative balance of -419 mL.
- Respiratory support includes an oxygen delivery device of a nasal cannula and an ABG result of ///32/.
- Physical examination findings are generally unremarkable except for a systolic murmur that is harsh, late peaking, and present on auscultation.
- Peripheral pulses are diminished in the left lower extremity.
- The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities, with black necrotic tissue observed in the left toes and atrophy/stasis changes in the left calf.
- Neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior, ability to follow simple commands, respond to verbal stimuli, and demonstrate purposeful movement.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 9.6 K/uL), hemoglobin (Hct: 30.0%), platelet count (Plt: 408), creatinine (Cr: 1.7 mg/dL), blood glucose (Glucose: 191 mg/dL), and abnormal coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR: 16."
