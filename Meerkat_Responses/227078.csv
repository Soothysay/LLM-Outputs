   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   70F with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung
   disease/hypoventilation, presenting with likely hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Has chronic hypoventilation with multiple
   chronic oxygenation and ventilation difficulties as result of
   restrictive body habitus, obstructive disease, diastolic CHF, pulmonary
   hypertension.  Reason for acute worsening currently unclear
 I suspect
   likely 2/2 CPAP nonadherance allowing her to run behind on CO2
   retention and possibly acute infection occuring (pulmonary or
   extrapulmonary), vs COPD exacerbation vs cardiac ischemia (less likely)
   vs. volume overload.
   Overnight workup:  BNP
 1800. Cardiac enzymes
 negative x2, repeating
   this AM due to CP. legionella urinary antigen
 negative.
   - Other infectious workup to account for decompensation - check urine,
   C.diff; f/u blood cultures.
 NGTD
   - Goal sats 90-93% given baseline CO2 retention (though may worsen
   pulmonary arterial pressures if hypoxic vasocontriction playing a
   role.  Decrease FiO2 accordingly.
   - Goal pCO2 85-90 with pH 7.3-7.35.
   - Would recommend reducing her minute ventilation by reducing her Vt by
   reducing her set Vt further
   - Will continue to attempt to decrease ventilatory support
 switched
   back to volume controlled ventilation in order to more tightly watch
   minute vents, though recommend switching back to PCV if pressures
   become an issue.  Would guess that patient somewhat of a rapid shallow
   breather at baseline (spirometry FVC is <500).
   - Standing bronchodilators via ETT.
   - Would recommend diuresis (with sufficient replacement of free water)
   to further decrease work of breathing).
   - Would continue vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage
   - Would continue prednisone 60mg PO Daily and Azithromycin 250mg PO
   Daily for COPD flare tx
   - Daily SBTs,
   - VAP PPX
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.  Now
   possibly in CHF after prednisone and some IVF although 200cc positive
   in ICU. JVD seems up though feeling ill and with diarrhea in past few
   days.  Recent TTE with volume overload and elevated PA pressures. BNP
   elevated.
   - Recommend lasix now.
   - Stop IVFs except KVO.
   - BP control with home agents.
   .
   # Anemia: Pt w/ HCT of 32, baseline of 34. Macrocytosis
   - Monitor
   - Recheck B12 and folate
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Stable. Mild but new.  Unclear etiology.  Did have
   borderline B12 level last admission with mild macrocytosis.
   - Obtain accurate home med list.
   - repeat B12 with homocysteine and MMA.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Resolved. Likely volume depletion with recent
   diarrhea +/- diuresis at home.
   - Replete free water PO here.
   - Hold lasix.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Resolved. Differential - mild renal insufficiency vs.
   med effect (albuterol).
   - Repeat this PM.
   - Hold ACEI.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung disease/hypoventilation presenting with likely hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure and intubation.

The patient's current medical conditions include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema with acute exacerbation. She also has chronic hypoventilation with multiple chronic oxygenation and ventilation difficulties as a result of restrictive body habitus, obstructive disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, and anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition indicates acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. These conditions can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at times, indicating possible hypotension. This can be due to diuretic use or volume depletion.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient had an episode of hyperkalemia, which is high levels of potassium in the blood. This can be caused by renal insufficiency or medication effects.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, indicating anemia. Further"

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   70F with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung
   disease/hypoventilation, presenting with likely hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient now s/p intubation.  At baseline she
   has chronic hypoventilation (high baseline pCO2 80s) with multiple
   respiratory issues as result of restrictive body habitus, obstructive
   disease, dCHF, and pulmonary hypertension.  Her acute decompensation
   likely secondary to CPAP nonadherance, COPD exacerbation, CHF
   exacerbation (BNP 1800, baselin 200s). Ischemia less likely as CE have
   been negative x2 and ECGs w/o ischemic changes.  Infection also
   possibility but sputum prelim has not grown out any organisms. CXR this
   AM with slight increase in vascular congestion but no signs of
   infiltrates/consolidations.
   - Continue ventilations w/ goal sats 90-93, pCO2 mid 80s, pH 7.3-7.35
   given baseline retention
   - Continue to decrease ventilatory support
   - Daily SBT trials, RISBI
   - Follow ABGs serially
   - Diurese w/ 80mg iv lasix, goal of 1-2L net negative
   - Standing bronchodilators for COPD
   - Continue short course prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation
   - Continue vanc, zosyn for HAP coverage, and azithro for atypical
   coverage/COPD for now
   - Follow up sputum cultures
   - VAP PPX
   - Possible extubation today
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Worse
   today possibly secondary to steroids. Likely contributing to current
   presentation, with elevated BNP and JVD on exam.  Recent TTE with
   volume overload and elevated PA pressures.
   - 80mg iv lasix, goal net neg 1-2L
   - Stop IVFs except KVO.
   - Strict I
   - Increase lisinopril to home dose for better afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia: Pt w/ HCT of 32, baseline of 34. Macrocytosis. Boarderline
   B12, normal folate
   - Monitor
   - Guaic stools
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Stable. Mild but new.  Unclear etiology.  Did have
   borderline B12 level last admission with mild macrocytosis.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Resolved by repleting free water.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung disease presenting with acute respiratory distress. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and required intubation.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, decreased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 280 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 57 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 89 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results reveal leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 129 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.1 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 129 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.1 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T (TropT) level of 0.01 ng/mL.

   # Respiratory failure.  Patient now s/p intubation.  At baseline she
   has chronic hypoventilation (high baseline pCO2 80s)  with multiple
   chronic oxygenation and ventilation difficulties as result of
   restrictive body habitus, obstructive disease, dCHF,  and pulmonary
   hypertension.  Her acute decompensation can be secondary to CPAP
   nonadherance, COPD exacerbation, CHF exacerbation (BNP 1800). Ischemia
   less likely as CE have been negative x2.  Infection also possibility
   but sputum prelim has not grown out any organisms. CXR this AM with
   slight increase in vascular congestion but no signs of
   infiltrates/consolidations.
   - Other infectious workup to account for decompensation - check urine,
   C.diff; f/u blood cultures.
 NGTD
   - Goal sats 90-93% given baseline CO2 retention (though may worsen
   pulmonary arterial pressures if hypoxic vasocontriction playing a
   role.  Decrease FiO2 accordingly.
   - Goal pCO2 85-90 with pH 7.3-7.35.
   - Would recommend reducing her minute ventilation by reducing her Vt by
   reducing her set Vt further
   - Will continue to attempt to decrease ventilatory support
 switched
   back to volume controlled ventilation in order to more tightly watch
   minute vents, though recommend switching back to PCV if pressures
   become an issue.  Would guess that patient somewhat of a rapid shallow
   breather at baseline (spirometry FVC is <500).
   - Standing bronchodilators via ETT.
   - Would recommend diuresis (with sufficient replacement of free water)
   to further decrease work of breathing).
   - Would continue vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage
   - Would continue prednisone 60mg PO Daily and Azithromycin 250mg PO
   Daily for COPD flare tx
   - Daily SBTs,
   - VAP PPX

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung disease/hypoventilation. She presented with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and chronic heart failure (CHF). Her acute decompensation may be secondary to nonadherence to CPAP, COPD exacerbation, CHF exacerbation, or ischemia. Infection is also a possibility, but sputum cultures have not grown any organisms. The patient's chest X-ray shows a large hiatal hernia, probable bibasilar atelectasis, stable cardiomegaly, and no signs of infiltrates/consolidations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has severe respiratory distress and is on mechanical ventilation. ARDS is a potential complication due to her underlying lung conditions.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated blood glucose level suggests uncontrolled diabetes. If left untreated, it can lead to DKA.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and the current symptoms suggest an exacerbation of the"

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung disease presenting with acute respiratory failure. She has a history of chronic hypoventilation, obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's acute decompensation is likely secondary to CPAP nonadherence, COPD exacerbation, CHF exacerbation, and possibly ischemia or infection. Imaging shows a large hiatal hernia, probable bibasilar atelectasis, and stable cardiomegaly.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 150/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with the following settings: tidal volume of 280 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The plateau pressure is 24 cmH2O, and the pulmonary arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pH 7.40, pCO2 57 mmHg, pO2 89 mmHg, HCO3- 41 mEq/L, and base excess 12 mEq/L.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung disease presenting with acute respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure and intubation. 

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema with an acute exacerbation. The acute decompensation is likely secondary to CPAP nonadherence, COPD exacerbation, congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current assessment includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation. 

The plan of care includes continuing ventilations with targeted saturation levels, pH, and pCO2, decreasing ventilatory support, performing daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and monitoring respiratory isolation status (RISBI). The patient will also receive diuretics for fluid management, bronchodilators for COPD, a short course of prednisone for COPD exacerbation, and antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) coverage and atypical coverage/COPD. Sputum cultures will be followed up, and prophylactic antibiotic therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will be administered. 

Additionally, the patient has chronic diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, contributing to the current presentation. Recent findings"

   has chronic hypoventilation (high baseline pCO2 80s) with multiple
   respiratory issues as result of restrictive body habitus, obstructive
   disease, dCHF, and pulmonary hypertension.  Her acute decompensation
   likely secondary to CPAP nonadherance, COPD exacerbation, CHF
   exacerbation (BNP 1800, baselin 200s). Ischemia less likely as CE have
   been negative x2 and ECGs w/o ischemic changes.  Infection also
   possibility but sputum prelim has not grown out any organisms. CXR this
   AM with slight increase in vascular congestion but no signs of
   infiltrates/consolidations.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of severe kyphoscoliosis, chronic restrictive lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. She presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury, hypertension, and an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has a baseline high pCO2 level in the 80s and multiple respiratory issues due to restrictive body habitus, obstructive disease, decompensated chronic heart failure (CHF), and pulmonary hypertension. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with the goal of maintaining oxygen saturation (Sats) between 90-93%, mid 80s pCO2, and pH 7.35-7.45. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS, acute lung injury, and COPD exacerbation put her at risk for continued respiratory failure. Monitoring and daily spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) assessment are important to determine readiness for extubation.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk for developing VAP. Measures such as head of bed elevation (HOB), oral care with chlorhexidine, and appropriate antibiotic coverage should be implemented.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's hypernatremia and hyperkalem"

   # Respiratory failure.  Has chronic hypoventilation with multiple
   chronic oxygenation and ventilation difficulties as result of
   restrictive body habitus, obstructive disease, diastolic CHF, pulmonary
   hypertension.  Reason for acute worsening currently unclear
 I suspect
   likely 2/2 CPAP nonadherance and possibly acute infection occuring
   (pulmonary or extrapulmonary), vs COPD exacerbation vs cardiac ischemia
   vs. volume overload. f/u BNP
 1800. Check cardiac enzymes
 negative
   thus far, repeating this AM due to CP. Checked legionella urinary
   antigen - negative
   - Other infectious workup to account for decompensation - check urine,
   C.diff; f/u blood cultures.
 NGTD
   - Goal sats 90-93% given baseline CO2 retention (though may worsen
   pulmonary arterial pressures if hypoxic vasocontriction playing a
   role.  Decrease FiO2 accordingly.
   - Goal pCO2 85-90 with pH 7.3-7.35.
   - Will thus decrease ventilatory support
 switched back to volume
   controlled ventilation in order to more tightly watch minute vents,
   though recommend switching back to PCV if pressures become an issue.
   Would guess that patient somewhat of a rapid shallow breather at
   baseline (spirometry FVC is <500).
   - Will continue HAP treatment and steroids for ?COPD exacerbation,
   though unclear how beneficial they will be.
   - Standing bronchodilators via ETT.
   - Would recommend diuresis (with sufficient replacement of free water)
   to further decrease work of breathing).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure and intubation. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), restrictive lung disease, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's current medical conditions include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, COPD exacerbation, and potential volume overload. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and decreased respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 95%.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 280 mL, respiratory support, and administration of antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam). Other medications include Propofol for sedation, Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, Hydralazine for hypertension, and Heparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL and macrocytosis. There is also thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 129 K/uL. Electrolyte imbalances include hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia. The patient's BNP level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac dysfunction.

Imaging reveals a large hiatus hernia and probable bibasilar atelectasis. Microbiology tests are pending,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of these conditions. The patient also has diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) that is exacerbating their respiratory status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may further deteriorate due to the acute exacerbation of COPD and the superimposed CHF.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, especially since they are intubated and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and critical illness can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
4. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and the use of certain medications can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation can increase the risk of developing pneumonia, which is a common complication in ventilated patients.
6. Hypotension and fluid balance issues: The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable, but close monitoring is required to ensure adequate perfusion and avoid fluid overload.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly low, and further evaluation"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient with the MICU resident and was present
   during key portions of the serviced provided.  The assessment and plan
   was discussed and is detailed above.  I would emphasize and add the
   following.  Patient tolerated extubation, was put on noninvasive
   ventilation only transiently and totally empirically in case she had
   trouble coming off the vent.  Actually looked better on a simple face
   mask.  Now on 3 L nasal cannula which is what she is on at home.
   Patient feels breathing is back to her baseline.  No cough.  Tolerated
   BiPAP overnight here.  Diuresing.
   Lungs with diminished breath sounds, no crackles.  No edema.
   CXR unchanged
   Stable since extubation yesterday afternoon.  Completing course of abx
   for HAP.  Emphasized to the patient that it will be important to wear
   BiPAP at home.  Stable for transfer to the floor today.
   Otherwise agree with full assessment and plan as above.
   Time spent:  25 minutes

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung disease/hypoventilation presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely secondary to acute lung injury or pneumonia. She also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and is now extubated without complications. She has a fever spike to 101°F, which is being treated with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) coverage. The patient is on bipap support, bronchodilators for COPD, and a short course of prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation. She is also receiving vanc and zosyn for HAP coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient presented with severe respiratory distress, which required intubation initially. Even though she has been extubated, there is a risk of recurrence if she does not adhere to CPAP or bipap support.

2. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's presentation included a CHF exacerbation, indicated by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and jugular venous distention (JVD) on examination. This could be worsened by prednisone use and pulmonary hypertension.

3. Infection: The patient's fever spike and positive blood cultures suggest an infectious source"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of severe kyphoscoliosis, chronic restrictive lung disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with respiratory distress, non-adherence to CPAP, congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, and likely infectious source. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She is now extubated and on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's presentation with severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia puts her at risk for ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever and pending blood cultures, indicating a possible infectious source. She may develop pneumonia, especially given her history of COPD and recent respiratory distress.
3. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress and non-adherence to CPAP suggest an exacerbation of CHF. This can lead to fluid overload and further respiratory compromise.
4. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic hypoventilation with high baseline pCO2 levels. If her hypoventilation worsens, it could lead to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has mild but new thrombocytopenia"

   Imaging: CXR AP [**2166-3-4**]:
   FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
   sitting semi-upright position and comparison is made with the next
   preceding similar study of [**2166-3-3**]. The patient remains
   intubated, the ETT in unchanged appropriate position. No pneumothorax
   has developed. As before low
   pulmonary volume related to rather high positioned diaphragms with
   crowded vasculature at the bases probably also containing some plate
   atelectasis. No evidence of new pulmonary infiltrates. NG tubes again
   being coiled up in a location compatible with large hiatal hernia.
   IMPRESSION: Stable chest findings on limited portable chest
   examination.

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   70F with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung
   disease/hypoventilation, presenting with likely hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory distress.  Patient now s/p extubation. At baseline she
   has chronic hypoventilation (high baseline pCO2 80s) with multiple
   respiratory issues as result of restrictive body habitus, obstructive
   disease, dCHF, and pulmonary hypertension.  Her acute decompensation
   likely secondary to CPAP nonadherance, CHF exacerbation (BNP 1800,
   baselin 200s). Ischemia less likely as CE have been negative x2 and
   ECGs w/o ischemic changes.  Infection also possibility but sputum
   prelim has not grown out any organisms. CXR today without nw
   infiltrates.
   - Continue BIPAP
   - Follow ABGs
   - Continue diuresis w/ 80mg iv lasix, goal of 1-2L net negative
   - Standing bronchodilators for COPD
   - Continue short course prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation
   - Continue vanc, zosyn for HAP coverage, pending sputum cultures
   probable DC tomorrow
   - Follow up sputum cultures
   # Chest pain: Resolved. Unlikely angina given lack of any EKG changes
   pre and post pain and enzymes negative x 2. Story not c/w angina. Could
   be related to her kyphosis as has some chest wall TTP. Pulmonary edema
   may be contributing. Resolved with Tylenol.
   - Cardiac enzymes x 3
   - Diuresis per above
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.  I
   suspect now pt is in worsening acute on chronic dCHF, possibly
   exacerbated by prednisone. Likely contributing to current presentation,
   with elevated BNP and JVD on exam.  Recent TTE with volume overload and
   elevated PA pressures.
   - Consider repeating 80mg iv lasix, goal net neg 1-2L
   - Stop IVFs except KVO.
   - Strict I
   - Continue lisinopril to home dose 40mg PO Daily
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Lytes
   - Likely call out to floor today
   .
   # Anemia: Pt w/ HCT of 32, baseline of 34. Macrocytosis. Boarderline
   B12, normal folate
   - Monitor
   - Guaic stools
   - Start vitamin B12
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Stable. Mild but new.  Unclear etiology.  Did have
   borderline B12 level last admission with mild macrocytosis.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Resolved by repleting free water.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Resolved.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung disease presenting with acute respiratory distress. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and chronic heart failure. The patient was admitted to the MICU due to respiratory failure and intubation. She was extubated without complications and her temperature spiked to 101 degrees Fahrenheit, which was cultured. The patient has a history of sleep apnea, chronic CO2 retention, and bad restrictive and obstructive disease. She is on nasal bipap overnight and K repleted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's presentation with severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia suggests the possibility of ARDS. This is further supported by her underlying lung diseases such as COPD and restrictive lung disease.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which could be exacerbated by her current condition and treatment.
3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and acute decompensation suggests a possible exacerbation of her COPD. She is being treated with bronchodilators and prednisone taper for this condition.
4. Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's elevated BNP levels and signs of volume overload on echocardiogram indicate worsening of her chronic heart failure. Her condition may be exacerbated"
