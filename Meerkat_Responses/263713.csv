   Disposition:
","The patient presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypotension. They had multiple episodes of melena, which is the passage of black, tarry stools, indicative of upper GI bleeding. The patient was started on neo gut for MAP 30-40s and subsequently weaned off prior to a tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan. The tagged RBC scan showed a focal site of bleeding in the duodenum, and interventional radiology (IR) is planning angiography.

The patient's medical history obtained from Hospital 19 includes allergies, but no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone on 10/17/2164 at 04:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of octreotide at 50 mcg/hour and pantoprazole (Protonix) at 8 mg/hour. Other ICU medications are not specified in the provided information.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dry mouth in the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) region.

Flow sheet data as of 10/17/2164 07:11 AM shows the following vital signs: temperature (Tmax and Tcurrent) at 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate (HR) at 121 bpm with a range of 87-121 bpm, blood pressure (BP) at 91/57 mmHg with a range of 65"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, and subsequent hemodynamic instability. He has been resuscitated with blood products and pressors. The source of bleeding has been localized to the first segment of the duodenum using a tagged red blood cell scan.

The patient is currently stable and receiving aggressive treatment, including octreotide, pantoprazole, ceftriaxone for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis, and holding beta-blockers and diuretics. The patient also has a partial portal vein thrombosis, which is being monitored without anticoagulation due to active bleeding. 

There is a non-gap metabolic acidosis of unclear etiology, most likely representing GI losses in the setting of massive GI bleeding. The patient's lactate levels are within normal range, without ketonuria or serum salicylates. The patient is being closely monitored with fluid resuscitation.

The patient's nutritional status is being managed with nothing by mouth (NPO), and electrolyte levels are replete. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with PPI gtt and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension. The patient has been admitted multiple times and has experienced recurrent melena and episodes of bleeding. The source of bleeding has been localized to the first segment of the duodenum. The patient has undergone aggressive resuscitation with blood products and required pressors for only two hours. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, and they are being treated with octreotide and pantoprazole infusions. Additional medications include ceftriaxone for prophylactic treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and diuretics and beta-blockers have been held. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and metabolic acidosis. Imaging reveals a partially occluded portal vein thrombosis, cirrhotic-appearing liver with ascites, patent umbilical vein, splenomegaly, and gallbladder sludge with wall thickening due to chronic liver disease. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with close monitoring and ongoing treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient has a history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, which can potentially occur again.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: As a result of liver cirrhosis, the patient may develop hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status"

","Summary:

The patient had recurrent episodes of melena and required aggressive resuscitation with blood products. The source of bleeding was localized to the first segment of the duodenum using a tagged red blood cell scan. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but remains at risk for further bleeding. The plan includes repeating an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate the proximal duodenum and treat the source of bleeding if possible. If the EGD is unsuccessful, angiography will be pursued. The patient is also receiving octreotide, pantoprazole, ceftriaxone, and vasopressors as needed. Other findings include a partially occluded portal vein thrombosis, cirrhotic-appearing liver with ascites, patent umbilical vein, splenomegaly, gallbladder sludge and wall thickening, and no evidence of acute cholecystitis or intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, presenting with painless bleeding per rectum and melena.
- He was initially evaluated with an EGD, which did not reveal the source of bleeding.
- Subsequently, he experienced recurrent melena and hypotension.
- A tagged RBC scan localized the bleeding to the proximal duodenum.
- The patient has been aggressively resuscitated with blood products and required pressors for only 2 hours.
- His current vital signs include a heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 91/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 36.7°C.
- The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but remains at risk for further bleeding complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient's condition is still unstable, and there is a risk of rebleeding from the identified source in the proximal duodenum.
2. Organ Failure: The patient's liver function is compromised due to ETOH cirrhosis, and there is a partial portal vein thrombosis. This could lead to liver failure and associated complications such as hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Infection: The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone) for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is also"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis presenting with painless bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract (BRBPR) and subsequent hypotension. The patient has been admitted multiple times for gastrointestinal bleeding episodes.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: The patient has a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 91/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula 2L.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is being monitored with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) ranging from 30-40s.
- Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 6,819 mL of fluids since midnight, with 4,273 mL given intravenously and 2,546 mL of blood products transfused.
- Respiratory support: The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.
- Physical examination: The patient appears to be in no acute distress, with icteric sclera, normal cardiovascular examination, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities.
- Neurologic examination: The patient responds appropriately but further assessment is pending.
