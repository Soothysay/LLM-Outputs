   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o Russian female with PMH of HTN, alzheimer's, recent CVA and PNA
   who presents from rehab with respiratory distress, requiring intubation
   and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for management.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Mixed hypoxemic and hypercarbic based on ABG at
   NH. Patient was intubated at rehab.  Differential includes recurrent
   infection, effusions, pulmonary edema, PE, cardiac event, aspiration
   event.  Appears to have been acute by history.  CXR here is concerning
   for fluid overload without clear infiltrate.  She recently completed
   course of treatment for HAP (vanc/zosyn).  WBC is stable from recent
   discharge and she is afebrile, making recurrent PNA less likely.  She
   does not have any h/o CHF and had normal EF last month, however patient
   has pulm. edema on CXR and elevated JVP indicative of some fluid
   overload.  [**Month (only) 8**] have developed flash pulm. edema in setting of HTN at
   rehab.  No clear h/o aspiration, however was getting feeds through NG
   tube so this is possible. Cardiac ischemia is in differential, Trop is
   slightly elevated at 0.1, however CK is flat and EKG is unchanged
   making an acute event less likely.  PE also in differential, however
   pt. was on ppx with Hep SQ at rehab.  pO2 significantly improved with
   inc. PS ventilation which supports diagnosis of pulm. edema.
   - Hold on abx for now given no clear infiltrate
   - Send sputum if has any
   - trend fever curve, WBC
   - SBT
   - will try to extubate today if MS improves
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC count is stably elevated at 16, was 18.2 on [**3-9**].
   Currently afebrile.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to recent pulmonary infection.  UA
   also dirty.  Patient was on flagyl for possible c diff, unclear whether
   this was empiric or confirmed.  Lactate 2.2.
   - Cont. flagyl for c diff
   - obtain rehab records re: diagnosis of c. diff, if only empiric can
   consider stopping
   - f/u urine cx.
   - CIS
   - trend fever curve, WBC
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline Hct low 30s, however was 24 on recent discharge,
   currently stable at 28.  No evidence of bleeding. Attributed to chronic
   disease in past.
   - Cont. to monitor
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na today 127.  Appears to have been trending down at
   rehab, was 131 on [**3-17**].  Has h/o hyponatremia in past [**2-3**] ? SIADH.
   Appears to be euvolemic-hypervolemic given elevated JVP.  Possible
   etiologies include SIADH, CHF.  No h/o liver disease.
   - Send urine lytes, osms
   - Follow with diuresis
   .
   # h/o CVA: Unable to assess good neuro exam given patient is sedated
   and intubated and Russian speaking.  Head CT shows evolution of known R
   ACA infarct and no new acute changes.  Per notes from rehab the patient
   is minimally responsive at baseline.
   - Cont. to assess frequent neuro exams to assess for changes.
   - Obtain more info re: patient
s baseline MS
   - Cont. ASA, statin
   .
   # Cardiovascular:  No documented h/o CAD, however has known PVD and
   also with q-waves on EKG which indicates a prior event.  EKG is
   unchanged here.
   - Cont. ASA, statin
   - Cont. BB, ACE
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Repeat EKG in am
   .
   # HTN: BP slightly elevated.
   - Cont. to monitor with diuresis.
   - Cont. BB, ACE at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, can resume TFs in am.  If extubated with need  formal
   swallow study, this was not completed on previous stay due to mental
   status issues.
   - consult speech and swallow once extubated
   - follow Na, lytes, replete as necessary

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and pneumonia (PNA). She presents with respiratory distress and required intubation. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, leukocytosis, anemia, hyponatremia, and a history of CVA.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's elevated JVP, rales in lung fields bilaterally, and fluid overload on CXR suggest pulmonary edema. This could be due to cardiac events or fluid overload.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Although there is no clear history of aspiration, the presence of an NG tube for feeding increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.

3. Cardiac Ischemia: The slightly elevated troponin level indicates a possible cardiac ischemic event. However, the flat CK level and unchanged EKG make an acute event less likely.

4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): PE is in the differential diagnosis due to the presence of risk factors such as immobilization and prior deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. However, the patient was on prophylactic heparin, which reduces the risk of PE.

5. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI): The patient has been on flagyl for possible CDI, but it is unclear whether this was empiric or confirmed"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o Russian female with PMH of HTN, alzheimer's, recent CVA and PNA
   who presents from rehab with respiratory distress, requiring intubation
   and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for management.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Mixed hypoxemic and hypercarbic based on ABG at
   NH. Patient was intubated at rehab.  Differential includes recurrent
   infection, effusions, pulmonary edema, PE, cardiac event, aspiration
   event.  Appears to have been acute by history.  CXR here is concerning
   for fluid overload without clear infiltrate.  She recently completed
   course of treatment for HAP (vanc/zosyn).  WBC is stable from recent
   discharge and she is afebrile, making recurrent PNA less likely.  She
   does not have any h/o CHF and had normal EF last month, however patient
   has pulm. edema on CXR and elevated JVP indicative of some fluid
   overload.  [**Month (only) 8**] have developed flash pulm. edema in setting of HTN at
   rehab.  No clear h/o aspiration, however was getting feeds through NG
   tube so this is possible. Cardiac ischemia is in differential, Trop is
   slightly elevated at 0.1, however CK is flat and EKG is unchanged
   making an acute event less likely.  PE also in differential, however
   pt. was on ppx with Hep SQ at rehab.  pO2 significantly improved with
   inc. PS ventilation which supports diagnosis of pulm. edema.
   - Hold on abx for now given no clear infiltrate
   - Send sputum if has any

   # Leukocytosis: WBC count is stably elevated at 16, was 18.2 on [**3-9**].
   Currently afebrile.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to recent pulmonary infection.  UA
   also dirty.  Patient was on flagyl for possible c diff, unclear whether
   this was empiric or confirmed.  Lactate 2.2.

   rehab, was 131 on [**3-17**].  Has h/o hyponatremia in past [**2-3**] ? SIADH.
   Appears to be euvolemic-hypervolemic given elevated JVP.  Possible
   etiologies include SIADH, CHF.  No h/o liver disease.
   - Send urine lytes, osms
   - Follow with diuresis
   .
   # h/o CVA: Unable to assess good neuro exam given patient is sedated
   and intubated and Russian speaking.  Head CT shows evolution of known R
   ACA infarct and no new acute changes.  Per notes from rehab the patient
   is minimally responsive at baseline.
   - Cont. to assess frequent neuro exams to assess for changes.
   - Obtain more info re: patient

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old Russian female with a medical history of hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and pneumonia (PNA). She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and required intubation. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, diuretics, and pain management.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and the need for intubation indicate a possibility of respiratory failure. This could be caused by conditions such as recurrent infection, effusions, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism (PE), or aspiration event.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing inflammatory response, possibly related to a recent pulmonary infection or another underlying cause.

3. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, which may be attributed to chronic disease or other factors. Regular monitoring is necessary to assess for worsening anemia.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which could be due to various reasons like SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), heart failure, or volume overload. It is important to correct this electrolyte imbalance to avoid complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o Russian female with PMH of HTN, alzheimer's, recent CVA and PNA
   who presents from rehab with respiratory distress, requiring intubation
   and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for management.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Mixed hypoxemic and hypercarbic based on ABG at
   NH. Patient was intubated at rehab.  Differential includes recurrent
   infection, effusions, pulmonary edema, PE, cardiac event, aspiration
   event.  Appears to have been acute by history.  CXR here is concerning
   for fluid overload without clear infiltrate.  She recently completed
   course of treatment for HAP (vanc/zosyn).  WBC is stable from recent
   discharge and she is afebrile, making recurrent PNA less likely.  She
   does not have any h/o CHF and had normal EF last month, however patient
   has pulm. edema on CXR and elevated JVP indicative of some fluid
   overload.  [**Month (only) 8**] have developed flash pulm. edema in setting of HTN at
   rehab.  No clear h/o aspiration, however was getting feeds through NG
   tube so this is possible. Cardiac ischemia is in differential, Trop is
   slightly elevated at 0.1, however CK is flat and EKG is unchanged
   making an acute event less likely.  PE also in differential, however
   pt. was on ppx with Hep SQ at rehab.  pO2 significantly improved with
   inc. PS ventilation which supports diagnosis of pulm. edema.
   - Pt likely developing VAP

   Concerning her AMS it is not due to sedative, nor electrolyte
   abnormalities. Pt
s hyponatremia has corrected itself. Pt does not have
   a UTI.
   - will continue to moniter for improvement
   # Anemia: Baseline Hct low 30s, however was 24 on recent discharge,
   currently stable at 28.  No evidence of bleeding. Attributed to chronic
   disease in past.

   # Hyponatremia: Na today 127.  Appears to have been trending down at
   rehab, was 131 on [**3-17**].  Has h/o hyponatremia in past [**2-3**] ? SIADH.
   Appears to be euvolemic-hypervolemic given elevated JVP.  Possible
   etiologies include SIADH, CHF.  No h/o liver disease.
   - resolved, likley to have been [**2-3**] volume overload, now euvolemic
   .
   # h/o CVA: Unable to assess good neuro exam given patient is sedated
   and intubated and Russian speaking.  Head CT shows evolution of known R
   ACA infarct and no new acute changes.  Per notes from rehab the patient
   is minimally responsive at baseline.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old Russian female with a history of hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and pneumonia (PNA). She presents to the hospital with respiratory distress, requiring intubation. She was admitted to the ICU for management. The patient has been experiencing fluid overload, as indicated by elevated JVP, rales in the lungs, and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. There are concerns about recurrent infection, effusions, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac event, or aspiration event. The patient's WBC count is elevated, suggesting a possible infection. She is also experiencing leukocytosis, anemia, hyponatremia, and has a history of CVA with minimal responsiveness at baseline. The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, but there is a history of known peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and prior heart event. She has been started on antibiotics, and her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and mixed hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The elevated WBC count and history of recent pneumonia suggest a possible recurrent infection, which can be a complication if not treated promptly.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's signs of fluid overload, such as elevated JVP and"

   discharge and she is afebrile, making recurrent PNA less likely.  She
   does not have any h/o CHF and had normal EF last month, however patient
   has pulm. edema on CXR and elevated JVP indicative of some fluid
   overload.  [**Month (only) 8**] have developed flash pulm. edema in setting of HTN at

   making an acute event less likely.  PE also in differential, however
   pt. was on ppx with Hep SQ at rehab.  pO2 significantly improved with

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old Russian female with a medical history of hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and pneumonia (PNA). She presented to the hospital with respiratory distress, requiring intubation and admission to the ICU for management. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, leukocytosis, potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), altered mental status (AMS), anemia, history of CVA, and cardiovascular issues such as hypertension and possible prior myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing mixed hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure based on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. This could be due to recurrent infection, effusions, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac event, or aspiration event.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's recent intubation and the presence of leukocytosis, there is a likelihood of developing VAP. The patient was receiving vancomycin and cefepime, which are appropriate antibiotics for treating hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
3. Fluid overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload, as indicated by pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). This could lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially heart failure.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status (AMS"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o Russian female with PMH of HTN, alzheimer's, recent CVA and PNA
   who presents from rehab with respiratory distress, requiring intubation
   and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for management.
   # Respiratory failure: Mixed hypoxemic and hypercarbic based on ABG at
   NH. Patient was intubated at rehab.  Differential includes recurrent
   infection, effusions, pulmonary edema, PE, cardiac event, aspiration
   event.  Appears to have been acute by history.  CXR here is concerning
   for fluid overload without clear infiltrate.  She recently completed
   course of treatment for HAP (vanc/zosyn).  WBC is stable from recent
   discharge and she is afebrile, making recurrent PNA less likely.  She
   does not have any h/o CHF and had normal EF last month, however patient
   has pulm. edema on CXR and elevated JVP indicative of some fluid
   overload.  [**Month (only) 8**] have developed flash pulm. edema in setting of HTN at
   rehab.  No clear h/o aspiration, however was getting feeds through NG
   tube so this is possible. Cardiac ischemia is in differential, Trop is
   slightly elevated at 0.1, however CK is flat and EKG is unchanged
   making an acute event less likely.  PE also in differential, however
   pt. was on ppx with Hep SQ at rehab.  pO2 significantly improved with
   inc. PS ventilation which supports diagnosis of pulm. edema.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old Russian female with a history of hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and pneumonia (PNA). She presents from rehab with respiratory distress, requiring intubation and admission to the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, dementia, leukocytosis likely due to developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anemia of chronic disease, resolved hyponatremia, and a history of cerebrovascular accident.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent infection: The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has shown worsening of her condition with an increasing white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection.

2. Fluid overload: The patient's chest X-ray shows signs of pulmonary edema, and her elevated jugular venous pressure indicates fluid overload. This could lead to further respiratory distress and cardiac complications.

3. Aspiration event: The patient has been receiving feeds through a nasogastric (NG) tube, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.

4. Cardiac ischemia: Although the patient's troponin levels are slightly elevated, the flat CK levels and unchanged EKG make an acute cardiac event less likely.

5. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at risk for PE due to immobility and prolonged bed rest. However, she is receiving prophylactic ant"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and acute CHF. The patient has a history of dementia, hypertension, recent CVA, and chronic kidney disease. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and received mechanical ventilation. He was extubated successfully yesterday.

The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and diuretics for fluid management. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 147/80 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. His temperature is within normal range, and he has no known drug allergies.

Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and absent pulses in both lower extremities. The patient is unresponsive and not assessed for neurological status. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances. Chest X-ray shows improving bilateral edema and effusions.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include dementia, respiratory failure (successfully extubated), CHF (continue diuresis), VAP (continue antibiotics), goals of care - DNI (do not intubate), d/w daughter if she visits, nutrition - decision needs to be made re: PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), restart TFs via NG (total parenteral nutrition through nasogastric tube), recent CVA (continue ASA), HTN - continue outpatient regimen, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's current conditions and assessment, potential medical complications may include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to mechanical ventilation and underlying lung disease.
2. Sepsis: With elevated white blood cell count and presence of VAP, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and absence of lower extremity pulses increase the risk of DVT.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's baseline renal function should be monitored closely, as certain medications may affect kidney function.
5. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has electrolyte imbalances that need to be corrected and monitored.
6. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
7. Delirium: The patient's baseline mental status should be assessed regularly, as delirium is common in critically ill patients.
8. Infection Control Measures: Due to the presence of VAP, infection control measures should be maintained to prevent further infections.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiac, and renal conditions. Regular reassessment of his neurological status and mental health is essential."

   Assessment and Plan
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT) - unresponsive
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]) - extubated successfully,
   continue to diurese, continue abx for VAP
   goals of care - DNI seems appropriate, d/w daughter if she visits
   nutrition - decision needs to be made re: PEG, restart TFs
   recent CVA - continue ASA
   HTN - continue outpatient regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with dementia, acute respiratory failure (successfully extubated), and is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106-147/52-108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%.

The patient's medical history includes dementia (possibly Alzheimer's or multi-infarct), recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and other unspecified conditions. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient has received various antibiotics and other medications, including furosemide, metoprolol, and heparin sodium.

The patient's recent laboratory results show stable kidney function with creatinine levels ranging from 0.4-0.5 mg/dL. The white blood cell count has been fluctuating between 10.1-16.4 K/uL. The hemoglobin level is 8.5 g/dL, and the platelet count is 488 K/uL.

The patient's imaging shows improvement in bilateral edema and effusions. The patient's goals of care include being a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status, diuresis for respiratory management, continued antibiotic treatment for VAP, and discussion regarding placement"
