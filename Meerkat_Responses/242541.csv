","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual admitted to the ICU with liver failure and coagulopathy. They have a history of chronic liver disease and hepatitis, as well as a recent episode of BRBPR without stool during bowel movement attempts. The patient required fluid resuscitation due to tachycardia and low blood pressure, resulting in improved urine output. They were given 2u fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and continue to receive N-acetylcysteine (NAC) until Tylenol levels are negative and the international normalized ratio (INR) is less than 1.5. An ultrasound showed appropriate waveforms in the hepatic and portal veins, but limited hepatic arterial waveforms appeared normal. The patient's tender RUQ may be related to chronic liver disease or hepatitis. Blood cultures revealed growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC), leading to the initiation of Zosyn/Vancomycin. The patient's HIV antibody test was negative. Tylenol levels have decreased from 20 to 5.2, while total bilirubin is rising. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were piperacillin on 04/14/14 at 03:30 PM and Zosyn/Vancomycin on 04/15/14 at 01:00 AM. The patient is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix)"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. The patient presented with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, as well as elevated creatinine levels. He also had hypotension, tachycardia, and abnormal coagulation parameters. Imaging revealed increased interstitial markings and subsegmental atelectasis on chest X-ray, and a thickened gallbladder wall on RUQ ultrasound. Blood cultures showed growth of gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. The patient has been treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for acetaminophen toxicity, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support. His condition has improved with appropriate management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has liver function abnormalities, likely secondary to Tylenol overdose. Other considerations include viral infection, ischemia, autoimmune disease, or other toxin exposure. Close monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation parameters is required.
2. Renal Failure: The patient may have developed renal failure due to Tylenol overdose, combined with prerenal causes such as poor oral intake and hypotension. Renal function should be closely monitored, and judicious hydration should be maintained.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to hepatic failure, renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. Upon admission, the patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including low oxygen saturation levels. The patient's medical history revealed a previous admission to Hospital 31, where they were diagnosed with liver dysfunction and received treatment for it.

During the course of their stay in the ICU, the patient underwent several tests and interventions. An ultrasound was performed on 04/14/2198 at 09:30 AM, followed by blood cultures taken at 08:16 PM on the same day and again at 02:00 AM on 04/15/2198. The blood cultures indicated the presence of gram-negative rods (GNR) and gram-positive cocci (GPC).

The patient experienced an episode of bradypnea without bowel movement (BRBPR) and required fluid resuscitation due to tachycardia and low blood pressure. Following the fluid resuscitation, the patient's urine output improved. Two units (2u) of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) were administered, but no FFP was given for liver bleeding. The patient's Tylenol levels were monitored, and when they reached 7.2, the infusion was stopped. The patient's total bilirubin levels have been rising.

The patient's allergies, last doses of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and changes to medical and family history were documented."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. The patient's liver function abnormalities are likely secondary to Tylenol overdose, with an initial INR of >9 and TBili of >9. Renal failure is also suspected to be caused by Tylenol overdose, combined with prerenal etiology due to poor oral intake and dry mucous membranes. Tachycardia may be attributed to poor oral intake, hepatic failure, and anxiety.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening liver and kidney function, infection (due to immunosuppression from liver failure), and respiratory complications (such as pneumonia or atelectasis). The patient's pain control should be managed carefully due to hepatic and renal failure. Monitoring for infection and close attention to medication dosages are crucial due to impaired liver and kidney function.

Further diagnostic tests and consultations are recommended, including a hepatitis panel, CMV, EBV, HSV, HIV test, alpha-1-antitrypsin, IgG, Ceruloplasmin, iron studies, and a consult with transplant surgery if necessary. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values is essential for proper management."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. The patient's medical complications include hepatic failure, polymicrobial sepsis, altered mental status, renal failure, tachycardia, and pain control.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are as follows:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, which can lead to further deterioration of liver function, increased risk of infections, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Polymicrobial sepsis: The patient has both gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR) in the blood, indicating a systemic infection. This can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), septic shock, and death if not promptly treated.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is agitated, irritable, and delirious, which may be due to alcohol withdrawal, central nervous system (CNS) infection, or hepatic encephalopathy. This can lead to worsening of cognitive function, increased risk of falls, and difficulty in providing informed consent for medical interventions.
4. Renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and accumulation of waste products in the body."

   Chief Complaint: Hepatic failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - declining mental status.  A&Ox0.  Though patient denies drinking,
   mother states that he has a history of alcohol abuse and believes that
   he would be likely to lie about his alcohol consumption.  She also
   notes that he has had some recent emotional stressors, such as the
   break up of a 10year relationship.  Pt increasingly tremulous and
   irritable, now in window for alcohol withdrawal.
   - Added ceftriaxone for CNX coverage, could not tap [**3-5**] coagulopathy
   - Pan-scanned looking for source of bacteremia
   - renal signed-off
   - toxicology wants NAC on until at least tomorrow am.  INR still
   elevated, though tylenol level 0
   - INR 2.7 --> 2.4 --> 2.3
   - CT Head - Prelim - No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. Near complete
   opacification of mastoid
   air cells on the right, and partial opacification of the left mastoid
   air cells. Minimal mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus with
   aerosolized secretions. Please correlate with signs and symptoms of
   sinusitis.
   - Ortho consult - Plain films and CT leg, need to get Op notes from OSH
   to learn more about the surgery and wash-out
   - CT Leg - Examination limited by lack of intravenous contrast for this
   indication, but multiple fractures with periosteal reaction which can
   be attributed to healing. No hardware loosening or frank bone
   destruction. Small amount of fluid medial to the talus which could be
   attributed to post-operative change.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient has a history of hepatic failure, likely secondary to Tylenol overdose. Other possible causes include viral infection, ischemia, autoimmune disease, or exposure to other toxins. The patient's INR is elevated, indicating impaired liver function.

2. The patient also has renal failure, which could be a result of the Tylenol overdose combined with poor oral intake and potential pre-renal causes. Hydration is being monitored, and the patient's urine output is good.

3. The patient has altered mental status, characterized by increasing agitation, anger, and hostility. There is concern for alcohol withdrawal or central nervous system (CNS) infection. The patient has a history of heavy drinking and past alcohol abuse. Ceftriaxone has been added at meningitic dosing, and consideration is being given to administering Acyclovir.

4. The patient has polymicrobial sepsis with both gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR) in the blood. The source of the infection is unclear, and a pan-scan has been performed without revealing a clear source but showing colitis. The patient is currently on vancomycin and Zosyn, and ceftriaxone has been added for possible CNS involvement.

   mother states that he has a history of alcohol abuse and believes that
   he would be likely to lie about his alcohol consumption.  She also
   notes that he has had some recent emotional stressors, such as the
   break up of a 10year relationship.  Pt increasingly tremulous and
   irritable, now in window for alcohol withdrawal.
   - Added ceftriaxone for CNX coverage, could not tap [**3-5**] coagulopathy
   - Pan-scanned looking for source of bacteremia
   - renal signed-off
   - toxicology wants NAC on until at least tomorrow am.  INR still
   elevated, though tylenol level 0
   - INR 2.7 --> 2.4 --> 2.3
   - CT Head - Prelim - No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. Near complete
   opacification of mastoid
   air cells on the right, and partial opacification of the left mastoid
   air cells. Minimal mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus with
   aerosolized secretions. Please correlate with signs and symptoms of
   sinusitis.
   - Ortho consult - Plain films and CT leg, need to get Op notes from OSH
   to learn more about the surgery and wash-out
   - CT Leg - Examination limited by lack of intravenous contrast for this
   indication, but multiple fractures with periosteal reaction which can
   be attributed to healing. No hardware loosening or frank bone
   destruction. Small amount of fluid medial to the talus which could be
   attributed to post-operative change.
   - Plain films- Status post ORIF. Periosteal reaction. Soft tissue
   swelling.
   - Started on Ativan CIWA scale

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo M with h/o fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic / renal
   failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use.
   .
   # Hepatic Failure: Likely secondary to Tylenol overdose, but other
   considerations include viral infection (h/o tattoos), ischemia,
   auto-immune or other toxin exposure.  INR > 9, TBili > 9 on
   presentation.
   - LFTs / coag monitoring
   - plan for NAC until Tylenol level negative, INR <1.5
   - Hepatitis panel, CMV, EBV, HSV: P
   - HIV: negative
   - Alpha-1-antitrpsin, IgG, Ceruloplasmin: P
   - Iron studies
   - SW consult for patient coping and insurance issues if transplanted
   - VitK 10mg IV x 1 given yesterday; no further FFP given
   - RUQ u/s with flow: coarsened liver, nl vascular waveforms, thickened
   GB wall may be [**3-5**] hepatitis or chronic liver disease
   - Utox: neg
   .
   # Polymicrobial Sepsis:  Patient with both GPC and GNR in the blood,
   unclear source.  Pan-scan [**4-16**] without obvious source but with
   colitis.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn.  Ceftriaxone added for ? CNS
   involvement.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - daily blood cultures
   - Final reads CT scan
   - Consider LP
   - OSH Op notes
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**4-15**] noted to have increasing agitation, anger
   and hostility.  Also with tachycardia / hypertension.  Per discussion
   with his mother, patient has been drinking heavily lately and has had
   drinking problems in the past.  Concern for withdrawal vs CNS
   infection.  Ceftiaxone added at meningitic dosing.
   - Change Ceftriaxone to Meropenum
   -  Consider LP vs EEG
   - STAT CT head now ?edema
   .
   # Renal Failure: Likely secondary to Tylenol overdose in combination
   with prerenal etiology given poor po intake and dry on physical exam.
   Also could have developed ATN if low BP in the last several days.
   Resolved.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely secondary to poor po intake, hepatic failure and
   anxiety and now polymicrobial sepsis
   - Improved with hydration
   .
   # H/o Fibular fracture: Does not appear infected at this point.
   - Monitor
   - Plain films / CT leg
   - ortho consult; obtain prior Op notes

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted for hepatic and renal failure.
- The patient has been experiencing declining mental status, agitation, irritability, tachycardia, hypertension, and potential alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
- The patient's INR has been elevated but is improving.
- The patient's blood cultures show polymicrobial sepsis with both gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR) present.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) indicate significant liver damage.
- The patient has a history of excessive acetaminophen (Tylenol) use, which could have contributed to liver failure.
- The patient's renal failure has resolved.
- The patient has a history of fibular fracture but no signs of infection.
- The patient's respiratory support includes a nasal cannula with oxygen delivery at 94% saturation.
- The patient's vital signs include tachycardia, tachypnea, and normal blood pressure.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile, and other abnormalities.
- The patient's imaging studies reveal near complete opacification of mastoid air cells, minimal mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus, multiple fractures with periosteal reaction in the leg, and small amount of fluid medial to the talus.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of left fibular fracture post-plate fixation who overdosed on Tylenol for pain relief. He presented with acute liver failure (ALF) and was transferred to [**State 254**] for further evaluation. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have decreased while he continues on N-acetylcysteine (NAC). However, he has become more belligerent, raising concerns for ethanol withdrawal, and started on the CIWA scale. The patient is now more obtunded in the morning, and a CT scan of his head showed only sinusitis. Blood cultures were taken at 10:00 PM, and the patient has been on various antibiotics including piperacillin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Zosyn.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 113 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 113/55 mmHg to 156/117 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. He is receiving intravenous fluids and has a fluid balance of 3,113 mL in and 2,477 mL out since midnight. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.56, PaCO2 of 29, HCO3 of 84, and O2 saturation of 4L.

During the physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and diaphoretic. His pupils are dilated, and he is unresponsive with non-purposeful movement. The rest of the examination reveals normal findings for the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and abdomen. The patient has trace edema on the right leg and 2+ edema on the left leg.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), altered kidney function with elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances. Other laboratory values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood cultures are also provided.

The assessment and plan include altered mental status, alcohol withdrawal, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, and electrolyte & fluid disorder. The potential medical complications that can arise include AMS (benzo intoxication vs. cerebral edema vs. meningitis vs. seizure), ID (sepsis, GNR and GPC bacteremia, unclear source), FHF (continue NAC), pancytopenia (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), and FEN (replete phos).

In summary, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture and Tylenol overdose presenting with ALF"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of acute liver failure, caused by an inadvertent over-ingestion of Tylenol. He has also sustained a left fibular fracture and underwent surgical repair. The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated, with symptoms including lethargy, obtundation, pancytopenia (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), and the presence of gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR) in his blood culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's lethargy and obtundation suggest a potential alteration in mental status. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, which could be due to factors such as benzo intoxication, cerebral edema, meningitis, or seizures. A head CT scan and EEG may be helpful in ruling out seizure activity.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of heavy alcohol use, there is a concern for alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to complications such as delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. Clonidine and haloperidol may be considered for management.
3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, indicating ongoing liver damage. Continued N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment is recommended to support liver function.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and suspected sepsis. The patient's condition has been critical, requiring intubation due to an inability to protect the airway. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
- EEG showed no clear seizure but some abnormality in the right frontal area.
- Surveillance culture sent, noting a downward gaze, not really responsive to ativan.
- The patient has a growing Citrobacter and Strep anginosis infection.
- Head CT unremarkable.
- Lumbar puncture was negative.
- The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, metronidazole, and meropenem.
- Vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- The patient has been receiving lorazepam for sedation and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- Physical examination reveals poor dentition, endotracheal tube in place, NG tube, warm jaundice, and absent pulses in both lower extremities.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolytes.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been well controlled.
- The patient is at risk for aspiration due to inability to protect the airway.
- There are concerns about"

   [**First Name (STitle) 1068**]
s note as outlined above. 44 yo male admitted with hepatic
   failure from Tylenol toxicity in the setting of increased pain s/p
   fibular fracture repair. Though the first few days of his
   hospitalization were characterized by improved liver parameters and
   normal mental status, he became progressive obtunded and was intubated
   for airway protection yesterday. Also with polymicrobial sepsis that is
   probably originating from the GI tract (translocation vs biliary)
   On exam, he remains unresponsive, has icteric sclerae with dilated
   pupils (though reactive to light) with marked left gaze preference.
   Lungs somewhat coarse BS, CV: RRR without wheezes or rales, Abd:
   distended but soft. Ext: bilateral boots with L>R edema and well healed
   incision scars.
   He remains critically ill with acute liver failure, acute respiratory
   failure, polymicrobial sepsis, and altered mentation. The latter could
   be from liver failure/sepsis but gaze preference concerning for seizure
   activity despite absence of overt seizure activity by EEG yesterday. LP
   and Repeat head CT yesterday negative, Neuro consulted and has
   recommended initiation of Keppra with 24 EEG monitoring starting
   tomorrow. Remains on Vanco/merepenem/flagyl/mycofungin- HIDA scan today
   and will also re-image LLE with IV contrast.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent on pt: 55 minutes.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old male with hepatic failure due to Tylenol toxicity. He was admitted with an increased pain score after fibular fracture repair. Initially, the patient showed improvement in liver parameters and normal mental status, but he later became progressively obtunded and required intubation for airway protection.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Inability to protect airway due to altered mental status.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction, possibly originating from the gastrointestinal tract.
3. Altered mental status, which could be attributed to liver failure, sepsis, or seizure activity. The presence of left gaze preference raises concern for seizure activity, although EEG did not show any clear seizure activity.
4. Liver function abnormalities, including hepatic failure.
5. Hypotension that is not related to shock.
6. Electrolyte and fluid disorder.

The plan for the patient includes:
1. Evaluating hepatic failure, suspecting 3-5 Tylenol overdose, and coagulation abnormalities that have plateaued after fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
2. Treating bacteremia with citrobacter and strep anginosis by switching to oral gastric (OG) feeding, adding micafungin per infectious disease (ID) consultation, and evaluating head CT.
3. Investigating thrombocytopenia, possibly due to liver failure or sepsis.
4. Assessing altered mental status"

   1. We recommend discontinuing Flagyl and keeping him broadly
   covered with Vancomycin and Meropenem until second GNR
   identified. We may be able to narrow to Vanco, Ceftriaxone and
   Flagyl in the future.
   2. Would further investigate the liver/gallbladder with HIDA scan
   as gallbladder thickening seen on ultrasound and could be source
   of bacteremia
   3. Daily blood cultures until documented clearing
   4. Lumbar puncture- can send CSF for cell count, gram stain, culture,
   protein, glucose, HSV PCR, and save tube 4 for further studies.
   5. Await OSH records regarding left fibular hardware infection and
   therapy.
   6. Please send stool for C. difficile x 3

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition. 

Firstly, the patient has hepatic failure, likely secondary to Tylenol overdose. This condition may lead to further complications such as coagulopathy, encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and liver cancer. 

Secondly, the patient has renal failure, which can be attributed to the combination of Tylenol overdose and prerenal causes. Complications of renal failure include fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and increased risk of infections.

Thirdly, the patient is experiencing sepsis with polymicrobial involvement. This means that there is a bacterial infection in the blood involving both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Complications associated with sepsis can include organ dysfunction, septic shock, and multiple organ failure.

Additionally, the patient has altered mental status, which may be due to alcohol withdrawal, central nervous system infection, or hepatic encephalopathy. Complications of altered mental status can include delirium, seizures, and increased risk of falls.

Overall, the patient's current condition poses several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and appropriate management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure secondary to excessive acetaminophen use. The patient's condition is complicated by altered mental status, polymicrobial sepsis, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, and electrolyte/fluid disorders.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may result in hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and confusion.
3. Liver transplant: Given the severity of the liver failure, the patient may require a liver transplant to restore liver function.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure could progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
5. Sepsis: The presence of polymicrobial sepsis increases the risk of systemic infection and septic shock.
6. Delirium tremens: The patient's history of alcohol use and withdrawal symptoms suggest a risk for delirium tremens, a severe form of alcohol withdrawal.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and risk factors may increase the likelihood of developing DVT.
8. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to the severity of his illness and the use"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. He has altered mental status, tachycardia, hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and multiple organ dysfunction. The patient's condition is complicated by liver failure, sepsis, alcohol withdrawal, and possible complications related to his fractured fibula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has liver failure likely secondary to Tylenol overdose. This can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased risk of infections.
2. Sepsis: The patient presents with polymicrobial sepsis, which may be due to various sources including the gastrointestinal tract or oral bacteria. This can lead to septic shock and multiple organ failure.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of heavy drinking and is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal. This can lead to delirium tremens (DTs), seizures, and autonomic instability.
4. Renal Failure: The patient also has renal failure, likely secondary to Tylenol overdose and poor oral intake. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and uremia.
5. Complications related to Fractured Fibula: Although the fracture does not appear infected at this point, it is important to monitor for signs of infection or delayed wound"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male who was admitted with suspected Tylenol toxicity and acute hepatic failure. He also has polymicrobial sepsis. The patient's course has been complicated by altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. He is currently sedated on propofol and has been started on Keppra due to concerns of seizures. Dental evaluation did not reveal any obvious infectious source, but it is incomplete. A HIDA scan was performed, but it was difficult to interpret.

Medical Complications:
1. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient is suspected to have acetaminophen-induced liver failure. He is being monitored closely, and lactulose has been continued to manage hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has polymicrobial sepsis caused by Citrobacter and Streptococcus anginosis. Antibiotic therapy has been adjusted based on culture ID, and meropenem has been discontinued due to its potential to lower the seizure threshold.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of hepatic encephalopathy and seizures. An EEG will be conducted daily, and propofol will not be discontinued until tomorrow.
4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient requires ventilator support for acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: Due to the patient's inability"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hepatic and renal failure, likely secondary to excessive acetaminophen use. The patient also has a history of fibular fracture, tattoos (which could indicate viral infections), and alcohol abuse. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical complications including sepsis, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, electrolyte/fluid disorder, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has developed polymicrobial sepsis with both gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR) in the blood. The source of the infection is unclear, but there are suspicions of an oral bacteria (Streptococcus anginosus) and a possible dental source. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole.

2. Liver Failure: The patient has acute liver failure with elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and jaundice. The cause of liver failure is likely due to acetaminophen overdose. The patient's liver function is being monitored, and he is receiving N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to prevent further liver damage.

3. Renal Failure: The patient also has acute renal failure, which may be secondary to acetaminophen overdose or prerenal causes. His kidney"

The patient is a 73-inch tall individual with an unknown weight. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, altered mental status, and liver function abnormalities. They are also at risk for aspiration due to their inability to protect their airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection.
2. Sepsis-related complications: The patient has already been diagnosed with sepsis. If left untreated or inadequately managed, it can lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect their airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can result in aspiration pneumonia.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status increases the risk of delirium, which can complicate their recovery and increase the likelihood of falls or other accidents.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function abnormalities may worsen if they continue to deteriorate, potentially leading to hepatic encephalopathy or other complications.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted to the ICU for hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, polymicrobial sepsis, pancytopenia, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's elevated INR and bilirubin levels indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest kidney dysfunction, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and uremia.
3. Polymicrobial Sepsis: The presence of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in the blood indicates a systemic infection, which can lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count can increase the risk of infections, anemia, and bleeding.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's agitation, anger, and hostility may be due to alcohol withdrawal or central nervous system (CNS) infection. Delirium tremens, seizures, and coma are potential complications if left untreated.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be secondary to poor oral intake, hepatic failure, anxiety, and sepsis. It can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia.
7. Fibular Fracture: Although the fracture appears stable at present, it could potentially lead to complications such as infection or non-union if not appropriately managed.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. A thorough physical examination and further diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with fulminant hepatic failure due to Tylenol toxicity and suspected underlying alcohol use. He has been critically ill and requires ongoing ventilator support, antibiotics, and other ICU interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway Compromise: The patient has an inability to protect his airway, which puts him at risk for aspiration and altered gas exchange.
2. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing polymicrobial sepsis, which can lead to systemic infection and organ dysfunction.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is obtunded, indicating a significant alteration in mental status that may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, seizures, or other factors.
4. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has liver function abnormalities, which can lead to further complications such as coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient may have imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which can affect various organ systems.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function.
7. Potential Hardware Infection: The patient has fib FX with hardware, although no abscess is present at this time. Regular monitoring is necessary to prevent infection.
8. Anemia: The patient initially had blood-tinged stools and required blood transfusions, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Ongoing monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary."

","The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, alcohol withdrawal, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and possible acute myocardial infarction. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is being treated with propofol until further evaluation by a neurologist. Lactulose is also being administered to manage hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are required. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, development of multiorgan failure, further deterioration of liver function, and complications related to mechanical ventilation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. He has several medical complications including hepatic failure, polymicrobial sepsis, altered mental status, renal failure, pancytopenia, and a history of fibular fracture. He is currently receiving multiple medications including N-acetylcysteine (NAC), antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, indicating liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased risk of infections.
2. Polymicrobial sepsis: The patient has multiple organisms isolated from blood cultures, suggesting a systemic infection. This can lead to septic shock, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not promptly treated.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing agitation, anger, and hostility, which may be due to alcohol withdrawal, central nervous system (CNS) infection, or other causes. This requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient has impaired renal function, likely secondary to acetaminophen overdose. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, there are several important events documented within the last 24 hours.

Firstly, an ultrasound (U/S) reveals that the patient's gallbladder (GB) is more distended compared to the prior scan. The GB appears filled with clear bile and shows no evidence of sludge or stones. The wall of the gallbladder is mildly thickened, and no pericholecystic fluid or bile duct dilatation is observed.

Secondly, the patient underwent surgery, but no need for GB drainage or intervention was required.

Thirdly, the Infectious Disease (ID) team's recommendations include only culturing if there is a spike in fever, and they are awaiting HSV PCR and checking vancomycin trough levels.

Fourthly, the Liver Recommendations involve continuing N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and antibiotics, as the patient is not a liver transplant candidate. Microbiology data confirms that Citrobacter is sensitive to ceftriaxone, so the antibiotics have been narrowed to this option.

Fifthly, the patient's hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance show stable conditions with appropriate vital signs. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and all other vital parameters are within normal ranges.

The respiratory support section indicates that the patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV), with a tidal volume (Vt) of"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo M with h/o fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic / renal
   failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use.
   # Hepatic Failure: Likely secondary to Tylenol overdose, but other
   considerations include viral infection (h/o tattoos), ischemia,
   auto-immune or other toxin exposure.  INR > 9, TBili > 9 on
   presentation.    Plan to continue NAC until INR < 1.5. Hepatitis panel,
   EBV negative. HIV: negative. Alpha-1-antitrpsin ELEVATED. Iron studies
   without evidence of hemachromatosis. Vitamin K given x 1. RUQ u/s with
   flow: coarsened liver, nl vascular waveforms, thickened GB wall may be
   [**3-5**] hepatitis or chronic liver disease. Utox: neg.

   - CMV, HSV: P
   - IgG, Ceruloplasmin: P
   - SW consult for patient coping and insurance issues if transplanted
   - Transplant surgery following closely
   .
   # Polymicrobial Sepsis:  Patient with both GPC and GNR in the blood,
   unclear source.  Pan-scan [**4-16**] without obvious source but with
   colitis.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn, now on Vanc, [**Last Name (un) 1540**], Flagyl.  GRC
   speciated to strep anginosus which is typically an oral bacteria, GNR
   citrobacter. Now new blood cx from yesterday with GPCs. LP - normal
   glucose and protein, no WBCs, f/u CSF cx.  OSH Op notes unrevealing.
   Hida scan unrevealing, repeat u/s w/o clear evidence of cholecystitis
   but indeterminate, surgery following.  Added micafungin per ID, will
   discontinue [**4-20**].  Changed NG to an OG [**3-5**] sinus infection.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - daily blood cultures, will not draw off any CVL
   - Final reads CT scan
   - daily blood cultures for surveillance
   - dental consult - teeth possible source of strep anginosus
   - Transplant surgery: no perc drain at this time
   - Change CVL today
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**4-15**] noted to have increasing agitation, anger
   and hostility.  Also with tachycardia / hypertension.  Per discussion
   with his mother, patient has been drinking heavily lately and has had
   drinking problems in the past.  Concern for withdrawal vs CNS
   infection.   LP unrevealing, follow-up cultures.
   - full EEG for evaluation of possible seizure focus
   - neuro consult: started Keppra, awaiting EEG report
   - continue lactulose
   - propofol for seizure treatment, will recheck daily
   .
   # Renal Failure: Likely secondary to Tylenol overdose in combination
   with prerenal etiology given poor po intake and dry on physical exam.
   Also could have developed ATN if low BP in the last several days.
   Resolved.

   Comments:
   Communication:  Comments:
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Hepatic failure: The patient has an elevated INR (international normalized ratio) and bilirubin levels, indicating liver dysfunction. This could be due to excessive acetaminophen use, viral infection, ischemia, autoimmune disease, or other toxin exposure. Continuous monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation profile is necessary. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) should be continued until INR is below 1.5.

2. Polymicrobial sepsis: The patient has both gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR) in the blood, suggesting a possible infection. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be related to the gastrointestinal tract. The patient is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole. Cultures should be monitored regularly, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on culture results.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has shown increasing agitation, anger, and hostility, along with tachycardia and hypertension. These symptoms could be indicative of alcohol withdrawal or central nervous system (CNS) infection. An electroencephalogram (EEG) should be performed to evaluate possible seizure activity. Neurological consultation is recommended, and the patient should be started on seizure prophylaxis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. They have a history of alcohol abuse and have presented with multiple medical complications, including sepsis, altered mental status, hepatic encephalopathy, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and regular chest X-rays may be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and early mobilization should be implemented.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver function is abnormal, and there is evidence of sepsis without organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of liver enzymes and other organ functions is crucial to detect any further deterioration.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating ongoing hypotension. Inotropic support and careful fluid management may be necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.
5. Electrolyte and fluid imbalance: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, and chloride levels, which need to be corrected promptly to prevent complications like cardiac arrhythmias or renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted with acute hepatic failure due to an accidental Tylenol overdose and a left fibular fracture. Despite initial signs of improving liver function, the patient's mental status deteriorated suddenly, leading to obtundation and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. Contributing factors include suspected abnormal liver function due to alcohol use, sedation, polymicrobial sepsis, and possible seizure activity. The patient has been started on Keppra and is still not following commands. A 24-hour EEG and repeat head CT are pending. Surveillance blood cultures were negative, but cultures from the central venous line yesterday grew Gram-positive cocci (GPCs). The central line will be replaced, and the patient will continue with current ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's sudden deterioration in mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver failure. This condition can cause confusion, altered levels of consciousness, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Polymicrobial sepsis: The patient has a suspected polymicrobial infection, with Citrobacter, Vivonella, and Streptococcus anginosis identified. Sepsis can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction, potentially worsening the patient's condition.
3. Fulminant hepatic failure: The patient's acute liver failure may progress to fulminant hepatic failure, characterized by severe liver dysfunction"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted for hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. He is intubated due to respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient's condition is complicated by altered mental status, hepatic failure, polymicrobial bacteremia, recent renal failure, pancytopenia, and a history of fibular fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a pressure support of 5 cmH2O. If his mental status improves and he can protect his airway, there may be a consideration for extubation. However, continued ventilatory support may be required if his mental status remains altered.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been experiencing agitation, anger, hostility, tachycardia, and hypertension. There is a concern for withdrawal versus hepatic encephalopathy. CSF studies are unremarkable, EEG showed no seizure, and brain imaging studies are unremarkable. Lactulose should be continued, and further consultation with neurology is recommended.

3. Hepatic Failure: The hepatic failure is most likely secondary to acetaminophen overdose. The patient has been on acetylcysteine continuous infusion. NAC should be continued until INR < 1.5, with ongoing monitoring of LFTs and coag"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic failure, polymicrobial sepsis, altered mental status, renal failure, tachycardia, and pancytopenia. The patient's current medications include N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for hepatic failure, vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole for polymicrobial sepsis, keppra for altered mental status, and propofol for seizure treatment. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 124/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, elevated bilirubin levels, low platelet count, and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient's abdominal ultrasound reveals a coarsened liver, normal vascular waveforms, and thickened gallbladder wall possibly indicating hepatitis or chronic liver disease. The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total intake of 5,225 mL and output of 1,845 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator,"

   protection.  Now off propofol overnight and slowly improving mental
   status.
   1. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.  His MS is
   improving, but not yet improved enough to safely extubate.  Will follow
   today off propofol and sedation. Currently adequate gas exchange on PSV

    - Hold propofol, continue PSV.
    - Will extubate whenever mental status improves
    - If develops agitation, favor haldol over re-initiation of propofol
   or benzos if possible.
   2. Liver Failure: He remains obtunded but now improving in terms of
   tracking and possibly following simple commands.  He awakens to voice.
   Overall, LFTS are improving.

","The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted to the ICU for an acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose, resulting in fulminant hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is currently off propofol with improvement in mental status. 

There have been attempts to place a central venous line (CVL) twice yesterday, but both attempts were unsuccessful. It was decided to have a line holiday instead. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics for a suspected infection, including meropenem, micafungin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Other medications include Atrovent, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), thiamine, lactulose, chlorhexidine, keppra, rifaximin, flagyl, and ceftriaxone. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure. The temperature is within normal range. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 40%, and the respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 50. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O. 

Laboratory results indicate liver dysfunction, with elevated liver enzymes and bilir"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted with an acetaminophen (APAP) overdose, leading to hepatic failure and encephalopathy. He required intubation for airway protection due to obtundation. The patient has shown gradual improvement in mental status, now off propofol overnight.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation support. There are plans to extubate once his mental status improves sufficiently. If agitation occurs, the use of haloperidol (Haldol) will be favored over re-initiation of propofol or benzodiazepines.

2. Liver Failure: The patient remains obtunded but is improving in terms of tracking and possibly following simple commands. Liver function tests (LFTs) are improving. Treatment includes the continuation of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and lactulose.

3. Anemia: The patient had hematochezia secondary to hemorrhoids, resulting in a decrease in hemoglobin concentration from 27% to 24%. However, he is hemodynamically stable. Repeat hemoglobin and hematocrit measurements are planned.

4. Infection: The patient has bacteremia with Citrobacter, Streptococcus, anaerobic bacteria, and Veillonella. Antibiotics have been initiated, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metron"

   Assessment and Plan
   44M admitted with APAP overdose and subsequent hepatic failure and
   encephalopathy leading to obtundation requiring intubation for airway
   protection.  Now off propofol overnight and slowly improving mental
   status.
   1. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.  His MS is
   improving, but not yet improved enough to safely extubate.  Will follow
   today off propofol and sedation. Currently adequate gas exchange on PSV
   [**6-5**].
    - Hold propofol, continue PSV.
    - Will extubate whenever mental status improves
    - If develops agitation, favor haldol over re-initiation of propofol
   or benzos if possible.
   2. Liver Failure: He remains obtunded but now improving in terms of
   tracking and possibly following simple commands.  He awakens to voice.
   Overall, LFTS are improving.
     - Continue NAC
    - Continue lactulose
   3. Anemia: Has had hematochezia secondary to hemorrhoids. HCT dropped
   from 27 to 24, but hemodynamically stable.
    - rpt HCT in PM
   4. ID: Bacteremia with citrobacter/strep/anaerobe/veillonella.
    - continue vanco/CTX/flagyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted with an acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose, resulting in fulminant hepatic failure and altered mental status. He was intubated for airway protection due to his obtundation. The patient has had multiple attempts at central venous line placement, which were unsuccessful. He remains on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he still shows signs of liver failure and encephalopathy. The patient has anemia, likely due to hematochezia caused by hemorrhoids. He also has bacteremia with multiple organisms, for which he is being treated with antibiotics. The plan is to continue N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and lactulose to manage liver failure and encephalopathy. The patient's mental status is improving slowly, but he is not yet ready for extubation. The attending physician agrees with the plan to maintain minimal sedation, continue NAC and lactulose, and monitor the patient closely.

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated due to his altered mental status and inability to protect his airway. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's mental status does not improve enough for safe extubation. The attending physician plans to continue PSV and will extubate when the patient's mental status improves.
2. Liver failure: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. He has been intubated due to respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient's liver function abnormalities and pancytopenia are likely secondary to acetaminophen overdose. He also has polymicrobial bacteremia, which is being treated with multiple antibiotics. The patient's renal failure has resolved. There are concerns about hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol withdrawal, and potential complications such as aspiration, sepsis, and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient has an inability to protect his airway, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has polymicrobial bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis, especially considering his compromised immune system due to hepatic failure.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver failure.
4. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of heavy drinking, and alcohol withdrawal symptoms are similar to those of hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Bleeding: The patient has pancytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding, especially with hemorrhoids.
6. Liver failure complications: The patient's liver failure puts him at risk"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to altered mental status and inability to protect the airway. He is currently extubated with good cough and gag reflex, but mental status remains altered. Monitoring of mental status is recommended.

2. Altered mental status: The patient has been experiencing increasing agitation, anger, hostility, tachycardia, and hypertension. There is concern for alcohol withdrawal versus hepatic encephalopathy. CSF studies are unremarkable, EEG showed no seizure, and brain imaging studies are unremarkable. Keppra has been stopped, and lactulose should continue. Sedatives should be avoided if possible.

3. Hepatic failure: This is most likely secondary to acetaminophen overdose. Hepatic panel is negative, EBV and HIV are negative, alpha-1-antitrypsin is elevated, but iron studies show no evidence of hemochromatosis. Vitamin K has been given once, and RUQ ultrasound shows a coarsened liver with normal vascular waveforms, thickened GB wall, possibly indicative of [**3-5**] hepatitis or chronic liver disease.

   indication for intubation was obtundation; but
   2. Liver Failure: He remains obtunded but now improving in terms of
   tracking and possibly following simple commands.  He awakens to voice.
   Overall, LFTS are improving. INR is rising, but other signs are
   improving.  His rising INR could also be complicated by nutritional
   deficiency.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted with an acute acetaminophen (APAP) overdose and subsequent hepatic failure and encephalopathy. He required intubation for airway protection due to obtundation but was successfully extubated overnight after showing some improvement in mental status. The patient remains obtunded but is now improving in terms of tracking and possibly following simple commands. His liver function tests (LFTS) are improving, and the INR is rising, which could be complicated by nutritional deficiency. The patient also has anemia with hematochezia secondary to hemorrhoids, and his hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 27 to 24. He has bacteremia with Citrobacter, Streptococcus, anaerobe, and Veillonella, for which he is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient continues to have persistent hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: Although the patient is currently stable and extubated, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to ongoing hepatic encephalopathy and potential deterioration in mental status.
2. Liver failure: The patient's hepatic function is still compromised, putting him at risk for further deterioration and complications associated with liver failure, such as coagulopathy and encephalopathy.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be monitored, and appropriate measures should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch tall male who was admitted to the ICU due to acute paracetamol (APAP) overdose and subsequent fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of agitation requiring extubation and mental status improvement. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antifungal agents, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is currently on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool device and a standby ventilator. There is a risk of developing further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia due to the inability to protect the airway.

2. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. This condition increases the risk of developing septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

3. Delirium or Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to various factors including the APAP overdose, hepatic failure, or alcohol withdrawal. This puts the patient at risk for delirium or delirium tremens (DTs).

4. Liver Failure: The patient has fulminant hepatic failure, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and decreased synthesis of clotting factors. This increases the risk of bleeding and other complications related to liver dysfunction.

5. Electrolyte and Fluid Im"

   Assessment and Plan
   44M admitted with APAP overdose and subsequent hepatic failure and
   encephalopathy leading to obtundation requiring intubation for airway
   protection.  Extubated overnight given some improvement in mental
   status and increased agitation; concern would require sedation.
   1. Respiratory failure: Oxygenation stable; now extubated.   His
   indication for intubation was obtundation; but
   2. Liver Failure: He remains obtunded but now improving in terms of
   tracking and possibly following simple commands.  He awakens to voice.
   Overall, LFTS are improving. INR is rising, but other signs are
   improving.  His rising INR could also be complicated by nutritional
   deficiency.
    - Continue NAC
    - Continue lactulose
    - off keppra now; will monitor for other signs of seizure activity
    - Vitamin K 10mg PO
   3. Anemia: Has had hematochezia secondary to hemorrhoids. HCT dropped
   from 27 to 24, but hemodynamically stable. Current HCT is stable.
    - will monitor daily
   4. ID: Bacteremia with citrobacter/strep/anaerobe/veillonella.  WBC is
   rising from 7.5 to 12.6 over the last three days.
    - continue CTX/flagyl x 14 days as per ID recs.
    - Monitor for signs of infection
   5. FEN: persistent hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia
    - recheck lytes in PM
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Start enteral feeds slowly; monitor for residuals

","The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted with acetaminophen (APAP) overdose and subsequent hepatic failure and encephalopathy, leading to obtundation requiring intubation for airway protection. He was extubated overnight given some improvement in mental status and increased agitation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 115/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool, endotracheal tube with FiO2 50%. 

The patient's physical examination shows no alertness but follows some simple commands, chest x-ray showing bilateral chest tube aspiration, regular rhythm without murmur, abdomen is soft, tender, and non-distended, and trace edema in extremities. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), low platelet count (PLT), elevated bilirubin levels, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and abnormal coagulation profile (INR). Other lab values including electrolytes, kidney function tests (Cr), glucose, and cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T) are within normal limits. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure with stable oxygenation after extubation, ongoing liver failure with rising INR, anemia with hematochezia secondary to hemorrhoids"

The patient is a 73-inch tall male who weighs 109.6 kg. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypotension, and liver function abnormalities. He has been experiencing increasing leukocytosis, and his blood cultures have shown multiple bacterial infections, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus (Milleri) group, Veillonella species, Bacteroides fragilis group, Citrobacter freundii complex, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole. He has also received vitamin K and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 125/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's weight has increased from 89 kg at admission to 109.6 kg due to tube feeding.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, increased lactate level, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and decreased platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but his albumin level is low. The patient's kidney function is impaired with elevated creat"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo M with h/o fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal
   failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use.
   # Respiratory failure: intubated due to altered mental status and
   inability to protect airway. Extubated [**4-21**] with good cough and gag.
   - monitor MS
   # Altered mental status: [**4-15**] noted to have increasing agitation,
   anger, hostility, tachycardia, hypertension.  Per mother, patient has
   been drinking heavily. Concern for withdrawal vs hepatic
   encephalopathy. CSF studies unremarkable. EEG showed no seizure. Brain
   imaging studies unremarkable.  Keppra stopped [**4-21**]. MS slowly
   improving.
   - continue lactulose, rifaxamin
   - hold sedatives if possible, Haldol PRN for agitation
   # Hepatic failure: most likely secondary to acetaminophen overdose. Hep
   panel neg, EBV and HIV neg; alpha-1-antitrypsin elevated however. Iron
   studies without evidence of hemachromatosis. Vitamin K given. RUQ u/s
   with flow: coarsened liver, nl vascular waveforms, thickened GB wall
   may be [**3-5**] hepatitis or chronic liver disease. Utox: neg. LFTs have
   been trending down. Has been on acetylcysteine continuous infusion.
   - LFTs / coag monitoring
   - Stopped NAC per Liver
   -
   .
   # Polymicrobial bacteremia: with coag-neg Staph, Strep anginosus,
   Veillonella, Bacteroides, Citrobacter in blood.  Pan-scan [**4-16**] without
   obvious source but with colitis.  Was initially on vanc, pip-tazo, then
   vanc, [**Last Name (un) **], metronidazole then vanc, ceftriaxone, metronidazole. LP -
   normal glucose and protein, no WBCs, f/u CSF cx.  OSH Op notes
   unrevealing. Hida scan unrevealing, repeat u/s w/o clear evidence of
   cholecystitis but indeterminate, surgery following.  Changed NG to an
   OG [**3-5**] sinus infection.
   - Current abx plan: CTX + Flagyl for total 14 d starting from [**4-14**]
   (first day of negative blood cx)
   - daily blood cultures
   - dental consult following
   - transplant surgery: no perc drain at this time
   .
   # Recent renal failure: Now resolved. Was likely secondary to
   acetaminophen overdose in combination with prerenal etiology given poor
   po intake and dry on physical exam.
   - Follow renal function
   .
   # Pancytopenia: hepatic failure. Now with bleeding from hemorrhoids.
   - transfuse for HCT <27, Plt <15 or evidence of bleeding
   # H/o Fibular fracture: Does not appear infected at this point.  Seen
   by ortho, no evidence of infection on ST, re-scan with contrast not
   felt to be unnecessary per ortho.  OSH orthopedist did not have any
   additional information.  Contrast scan of the leg: no clear fluid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted with hepatic and renal failure, likely secondary to excessive acetaminophen use. He was intubated due to respiratory failure but has since been extubated. The patient has had episodes of altered mental status and agitation, for which he has been prescribed lactulose and rifaximin. His liver function tests have been trending down, and he has been on acetylcysteine continuous infusion. He has polymicrobial bacteremia with coag-neg Staph, Strep anginosus, Veillonella, Bacteroides, and Citrobacter in the blood. He underwent a Hida scan and repeat ultrasound without clear evidence of cholecystitis but indeterminate. His renal failure has resolved. The patient is experiencing pancytopenia due to hepatic failure and has been transfused for HCT <27 and Plt <15 or evidence of bleeding. He has a history of fibular fracture, which does not appear infected at this point.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, especially considering his hepatic failure.
2. Infection: The presence of polymicrobial bacteremia indicates a risk of ongoing infection, which needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Bleeding: The patient's pancytopenia puts him at risk for bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo M with h/o fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal
   failure in the setting of excessive acetaminophen use.
   # Respiratory failure: intubated due to altered mental status and
   inability to protect airway. Extubated [**4-21**] with good cough and gag.
   - monitor MS; improving
   # Altered mental status: [**4-15**] noted to have increasing agitation,
   anger, hostility, tachycardia, hypertension.  Per mother, patient has
   been drinking heavily. Concern for withdrawal vs hepatic
   encephalopathy. CSF studies unremarkable. EEG showed no seizure. Brain
   imaging studies unremarkable.  Keppra stopped [**4-21**]. MS slowly
   improving.
   - continue lactulose, rifaxamin
   - Thiamine
   - hold sedatives if possible, Haldol PRN for agitation
   # Hepatic failure: most likely secondary to acetaminophen overdose. Hep
   panel neg, EBV and HIV neg; alpha-1-antitrypsin elevated however. Iron
   studies without evidence of hemachromatosis. Vitamin K given. RUQ u/s
   with flow: coarsened liver, nl vascular waveforms, thickened GB wall
   may be [**3-5**] hepatitis or chronic liver disease. Utox: neg. LFTs have
   been trending down. Has been on acetylcysteine continuous infusion.
   - LFTs / coag monitoring
   - Stopped NAC per Liver [**4-22**]
   # Polymicrobial bacteremia: with coag-neg Staph, Strep anginosus,
   Veillonella, Bacteroides, Citrobacter in blood.  Pan-scan [**4-16**] without
   obvious source but with colitis.  Was initially on vanc, pip-tazo, then
   vanc, [**Last Name (un) **], metronidazole then vanc, ceftriaxone, metronidazole. LP -
   normal glucose and protein, no WBCs, f/u CSF cx.  OSH Op notes
   unrevealing. Hida scan unrevealing, repeat u/s w/o clear evidence of
   cholecystitis but indeterminate, surgery following.  Changed NG to an
   OG [**3-5**] sinus infection.
   - Current abx plan: CTX + Flagyl for total 14 days starting from [**4-14**]
   (first day of negative blood cx)
   - blood cultures PRN fever
   - dental consult following; goal to  have panorex once able to
   participate in study
   - transplant surgery: no perc drain at this time
   # Recent renal failure: Now resolved. Was likely secondary to
   acetaminophen overdose in combination with prerenal etiology given poor
   po intake and dry on physical exam.
   - Follow renal function
   # Pancytopenia: hepatic failure. Now with bleeding from hemorrhoids.
   - transfuse for HCT <27, Plt <15 or evidence of bleeding
   # H/o Fibular fracture: Does not appear infected at this point.  Seen
   by ortho, no evidence of infection on ST, re-scan with contrast not
   felt to be unnecessary per ortho.  OSH orthopedist did not have any
   additional information.  Contrast scan of the leg: no clear fluid
   collection/abscess.
   - Monitor
   # Buttocks rash: Noted on [**4-23**].  Appears fungal and patient with
   increased stool output with lactulose for HE.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure due to excessive acetaminophen use. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, altered mental status, hepatic failure, polymicrobial bacteremia, recent renal failure, pancytopenia, and a h/o fibular fracture. The patient's condition has been improving gradually, with improvements in mental status, resolution of renal failure, and decreasing liver function tests. However, he continues to have episodes of agitation and hallucinations, requiring sedation with Haldol. He is being treated with multiple antibiotics for the polymicrobial bacteremia and has been started on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's bleeding from hemorrhoids indicates ongoing pancytopenia. He also has a buttocks rash that appears fungal and may be related to increased stool output with lactulose.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic failure and elevated ammonia levels indicate a risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Continued monitoring and management with lactulose and rifaximin are recommended.
2. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures show multiple bacteria, indicating a risk for sepsis. Continued antibiotic therapy is necessary, and blood cultures should be monitored for any signs of fever.
3. Pancytopenia: The"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was present with the ICU team for
   the key portions of services provided. I would add: 44 yo male admitted
   with acute liver failure from tylenol toxicity + EtOH, complicated by
   acute mental status/respiratory failure, course also notable for
   polymicrobial sepsis presumed from gut translocation. He was extubated
   [**4-21**] and although MS waxes and wanes, this morning he is able to follow
   some commands and answer a few short questions. His INR is increasing,
   though this may represent malnutrition rather than worsening liver
   failure/decreased synthetic function.  Plan continued lactulose,
   CTX/flagyl for microbial sepsis, topical antifungals for sacral fungal
   rash.

The patient is a 89 kg, 73-inch male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient was extubated on Saturday evening and observed overnight due to hallucinations, for which he was given haloperidol.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 4/21/2198 at 11:58 AM, ceftriaxone on 4/22/2198 at 8:30 PM, and metronidazole on 4/23/2198 at 8:32 AM. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) via infusion.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 123 bpm with a range of 104-129 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/60 mmHg to 144/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 14-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's weight has increased from 89 kg at admission to 109.6 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,973 mL, including 1,432 mL of IV fluids, and a total output of 2,110 mL, consisting of 1,110 mL of urine. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube.

The patient's blood gases show an ABG result of //21/. The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, has poor dentition, warm skin, jaundice, and tender RUQ and RLQ without rebound tenderness. The patient's extremities are swollen, and his neurologic examination shows that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and is oriented to person only. The rest of the physical examination findings are unremarkable.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 7.5 to 12.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count ranging from 54 to 123 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 71/62, Alk Phos: 163, T Bili: 17.8, etc.). The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for low potassium (K+: 0.7 mg/dL) and magnesium (Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL). Other lab results are also abnormal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure secondary to excessive acetaminophen use. The patient presented with respiratory failure, intubated due to altered mental status and inability to protect airway, but has since been extubated with good cough and gag reflex. He also has altered mental status, likely due to alcohol withdrawal or hepatic encephalopathy, with improvement over time. The patient has hepatic failure, most likely secondary to acetaminophen overdose, with elevated liver enzymes and coagulation abnormalities. He has been on acetylcysteine continuous infusion but has since stopped. The patient also had polymicrobial bacteremia, treated with a combination of antibiotics, and underwent a HIDA scan which showed an indeterminate result. The patient's renal failure has resolved. He now presents with pancytopenia, likely due to hepatic failure, and is experiencing bleeding from hemorrhoids. The patient's fibular fracture does not appear infected, and he has a recent history of buttocks rash, which is suspected to be fungal in nature.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation due to altered mental status and inability to protect his airway. Although he has been extubated, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if his mental status worsens or if he develops any complications that could compromise his air"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of fibular fracture, admitted with hepatic and renal failure due to excessive acetaminophen use. The patient is intubated due to altered mental status and inability to protect airway, but was extubated on 04/21 with good cough and gag. The patient has been drinking heavily, leading to concerns for alcohol withdrawal versus hepatic encephalopathy. He is currently on lactulose and rifaxamin for hepatic failure, as well as thiamine and haloperidol for agitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to altered mental status and inability to protect airway. Although he was extubated on 04/21 with good cough and gag, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's mental status worsens or if he experiences aspiration.

2. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient had polymicrobial bacteremia with coag-neg Staph, Strep anginosus, Veillonella, Bacteroides, Citrobacter in blood. He was treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole. It is important to monitor for any signs of sepsis recurrence.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted with fulminant hepatic failure due to Tylenol toxicity and suspected alcohol consumption. He also has polymicrobial sepsis, acute respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has improved over the past couple of days, but he is still intermittently confused. He is currently taking lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and will be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, cough): The patient's altered mental status puts him at risk for aspiration, which can lead to respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has polymicrobial bacteremia, indicating a systemic infection. If not treated properly, it can progress to sepsis and potentially organ dysfunction.
3. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's mental status is altered due to hepatic encephalopathy. This can cause confusion and other cognitive impairments.
4. Alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures): The patient's history of alcohol consumption increases the risk of alcohol withdrawal symptoms upon cessation.
5. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has acute hepatic failure, which can lead to further liver damage and dysfunction.
6. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotension. This could be"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and was subsequently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is still delirious but communicative. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is now taking oral medications. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole) for suspected polymicrobial bacteremia. 

Upon physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished, with poor dentition. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. Fluid balance reveals an input of 2,465 mL, including 968 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 1,675 mL, including 610 mL of blood products. The patient's weight has increased from 89 kg at admission to 109.6 kg currently.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and decreased platelet count. Liver function tests indicate abnormal liver enzymes, while kidney function is within normal limits. Electrolytes are relatively balanced, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. Other lab results, including blood glucose and cardiac enzymes, are within normal ranges.

The patient's current assessment includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status (likely hepatic encephalopathy), alcohol withdrawal, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, and electrolyte/fl"
