   Assessment and Plan
   78yo F with no past medical history transferred from OSH after having
   NSTEMI in setting of hip fracture from mechanical fall.
   NSTEMI: patient with elevated troponin 1.99 at OSH and .27 here. She
   had t wave inversions throughout that are possibly post ischemic. They
   are diffuse, however, so unlocalizable, it is unclear if they are
   acute. This patient may be a good candidate for viability study if cath
   shows diffuse disease. Her EF is 20% so appears that some of teh
   akinesis on echo may be old.
   - Aspirin 325, plavix 75 (had plavix at OSH since [**3-21**])
   - Metoprolo IV as needed for HR
   - heparin IV
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EKG in AM
   - ECHO
   - ACE when BP tolerates
   Atrial Fibrillation/Pauses: appears that this is since this AM. RVR as
   fast as 160s. on the floor she was given 5mg iv lopressor and had 5s
   pause, appeared to be conversion pause. has not had this on floor
   despite more metoprolol. In CCU, about 30 minutes after metoprolol
   patient had >6s pause, asymptomatic
   - Metoprolol IV for HR <130s
   - hold off on rhythm control for now
   - on heparin for anticoagulation
   - consider EP consult if pauses continue
   Mental Status Changes: Patient was A+OX3 prior to getting dilaudid last
   night so suspect medication effect. patient now mentating better than
   on floor, but still foggy
   - head CT negative
   - use narcotics with caution
   Fever: to 102 on arrival to floor. patient had cough, but per neice it
   is chronic [**2-1**] smoking. denies abd pain, urinary complaints. may be
   related to hip, atelectasis
   - blood cultures
   - UA and culture
   - CXR: no infiltrate
   Systolic CHF: acuity is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] of 20% is low for a first NSTEMI.
   does not appear volume overloaded
   - will recheck ECHO here
   Left hip fracture: At OSH orthopedist recommended internal fixation
   however will need cardiac stabilization first and then will likely need
   repeat orthopedic evaluation and intervention here.
   - Will manage pain
   - heparin IV for DVT ppx
   - Monitor pulses, edema, hct to ensure no bleed into joint
   - orthopedics consult appreciated

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). CCU team.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). CCU team. Progress reviewed extensively during family
   meeting.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Feels markedly improved today.  IN sinus rhythm --> no further
   conversion pauses since last PM.  Echo - my preliminary review.  LVEF
   ~35-40% with hypokinesis of mid- and distal anterior and anteroseptal
   segments and apex.  No thrombus.
   Plan:
   1. Coronary angiography today, no DES.  If acute-appearing lesions -->
   prefer POBA or bare-metal stent.  Chronic-appearing diffuse lesions
   probably do not warrant PCI at this time, and may be readdressed later
   if ischemic symptoms are present.
   2. Commence rhythm control with amiodarone
   3. If further SYMPTOMATIC bradycardia, will consider PPM placement
   4. Long-term warfarin anticoagultion given high CHADS 2 risk score
   ICU care for heart failure, +/- ACS

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and a hip fracture from a mechanical fall. She has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and may be a candidate for a viability study if catheterization shows diffuse disease. The patient's rhythm has been unstable, with episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and occasional nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). She has converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously, but with pauses after metoprolol administration. Her mental status has improved, and her fever has resolved.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/35 mmHg to 145/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals supple neck with jugular venous pressure of 10 cm, mild bibasilar crackles in the lungs, and no peripheral edema or skin abnormalities. Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and electrolyte levels, but elevated troponin levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. NSTEMI: The patient has elevated troponin levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who presented with NSTEMI and a hip fracture from a mechanical fall.
- She has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, converted to sinus rhythm at one point but later experienced pauses after receiving metoprolol.
- The patient has occasional nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
- She has a low ejection fraction of 20% and may be a candidate for a viability study if the catheterization shows diffuse disease.
- Her mental status has improved since the previous day.
- She has a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, but no clear cause has been identified.
- Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 70 to 157 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91/35 to 145/67 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 16 to 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.
- Her fluid balance shows a total intake of 726 mL and a total output of 210 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 516 mL.
- Her laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, and normal glucose levels.
- She has ongoing orders for heparin, aspirin, Plavix, and monitoring on telemetry.
- The patient's code status is DNR/D"

   Assessment and Plan
   78yo F with no past medical history transferred from OSH after having
   NSTEMI in setting of hip fracture from mechanical fall.
   NSTEMI: patient with elevated troponin 1.99 at OSH and .27 here. She
   had t wave inversions throughout that are possibly post ischemic. They
   are diffuse, however, so unlocalizable, it is unclear if they are
   acute. This patient may be a good candidate for viability study if cath
   shows diffuse disease. Her EF is 20% so appears that some of teh
   akinesis on echo may be old.
   - Aspirin 325, plavix 75 (had plavix at OSH since [**3-21**])
   - Metoprolo IV as needed for HR
   - heparin IV
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EKG in AM
   - ECHO
   - ACE when BP tolerates
   Atrial Fibrillation/Pauses: appears that this is since this AM. RVR as
   fast as 160s. on the floor she was given 5mg iv lopressor and had 5s
   pause, appeared to be conversion pause. has not had this on floor
   despite more metoprolol. In CCU, about 30 minutes after metoprolol
   patient had >6s pause, asymptomatic
   - Metoprolol IV for HR <130s
   - hold off on rhythm control for now
   - on heparin for anticoagulation
   - consider EP consult if pauses continue
   Mental Status Changes: Patient was A+OX3 prior to getting dilaudid last
   night so suspect medication effect. patient now mentating better than
   on floor, but still foggy
   - head CT negative
   - use narcotics with caution
   Fever: to 102 on arrival to floor. patient had cough, but per neice it
   is chronic [**2-1**] smoking. denies abd pain, urinary complaints. may be
   related to hip, atelectasis
   - blood cultures
   - UA and culture
   - CXR: no infiltrate
   Systolic CHF: acuity is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] of 20% is low for a first NSTEMI.
   does not appear volume overloaded
   - will recheck ECHO here
   Left hip fracture: At OSH orthopedist recommended internal fixation
   however will need cardiac stabilization first and then will likely need
   repeat orthopedic evaluation and intervention here.
   - Will manage pain
   - heparin IV for DVT ppx
   - Monitor pulses, edema, hct to ensure no bleed into joint
   - orthopedics consult appreciated

","Summary:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who was transferred from OSH after experiencing a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of a hip fracture from a mechanical fall.
- She has elevated troponin levels and diffuse T-wave inversions on the ECG, which could be post-ischemic or acute.
- The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 20%, indicating some degree of cardiac dysfunction.
- She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions.
- The patient has been started on aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol IV as needed for heart rate control, heparin IV, and is on telemetry monitoring.
- An EKG and echocardiogram have been ordered to further evaluate her cardiac status.
- The patient also has a left hip fracture, for which orthopedic stabilization is needed after initial cardiac stabilization.
- The patient's fever is being evaluated, and blood cultures have been obtained.
- The patient has a DNR/DNI code status with the exception of during procedures such as surgery or cardiac catheterization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications:
- The patient's low ejection fraction and history of NSTEMI put her at risk for further cardiac events, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
- The presence of atrial fibrillation with pauses and occasional non-sustained ventricular"

   Assessment and Plan
   78yo F with no past medical history transferred from OSH after having
   NSTEMI in setting of hip fracture from mechanical fall.
   NSTEMI: patient with elevated troponin 1.99 at OSH and .27 here. She
   had t wave inversions throughout that are possibly post ischemic. They
   are diffuse, however, so unlocalizable, it is unclear if they are
   acute. This patient may be a good candidate for viability study if cath
   shows diffuse disease. Her EF is 20% so appears that some of teh
   akinesis on echo may be old.
   - Aspirin 325, plavix 75 (had plavix at OSH since [**3-21**])
   - Metoprolo IV as needed for HR
   - heparin IV
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EKG in AM
   - ECHO
   - ACE when BP tolerates
   Atrial Fibrillation/Pauses: appears that this is since this AM. RVR as
   fast as 160s. on the floor she was given 5mg iv lopressor and had 5s
   pause, appeared to be conversion pause. has not had this on floor
   despite more metoprolol. In CCU, about 30 minutes after metoprolol
   patient had >6s pause, asymptomatic
   - Metoprolol IV for HR <130s
   - hold off on rhythm control for now
   - on heparin for anticoagulation
   - consider EP consult if pauses continue
   Mental Status Changes: Patient was A+OX3 prior to getting dilaudid last
   night so suspect medication effect. patient now mentating better than
   on floor, but still foggy
   - head CT negative
   - use narcotics with caution
   Fever: to 102 on arrival to floor. patient had cough, but per neice it

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who was transferred from OSH after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of a hip fracture from a mechanical fall.
- The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and she has t-wave inversions on the EKG, which could be post-ischemic or acute.
- The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, suggesting some akinesis on echo may be old.
- The patient is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol IV for heart rate control.
- She is also on heparin IV for anticoagulation and is being monitored on telemetry.
- An EKG in the morning, an echo, and ACE when BP tolerates are planned.
- The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) up to 160s and had pauses of 5-4 seconds, but converted to sinus rhythm.
- Metoprolol IV is being used for heart rate control <130s, and an electrophysiology (EP) consult is being considered if pauses continue.
- The patient also has mental status changes, which are suspected to be medication-related.
- She has a fever of 102 degrees, cough, and chronic smoking history, but denies abdominal or urinary complaints.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of no past medical conditions who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of a hip fracture caused by a mechanical fall. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 20%, indicating significant heart dysfunction. She underwent a cardiac catheterization, which showed diffuse coronary artery disease, and she is being considered for a viability study. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with pauses, mental status changes, fever, and possible acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's low EF and history of NSTEMI, there is a high risk of further cardiac complications such as recurrent myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or progression of CHF.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and cough may indicate an infection, which could be related to her chronic smoking history, atelectasis, or urinary tract infection.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's bibasilar crackles in the lungs may suggest underlying pulmonary edema or pneumonia, which can be exacerbated by her CHF or immobilization.
4. Hip Fracture Complications: The patient's left hip fracture increases the risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobil"

   NSTEMI in setting of hip fracture from mechanical fall.
   Left hip fracture: patient getting ORIF of left hip today
   - Will manage pain, cautious with narcotics
   - sub q hep for dvt prophylaxis
   - Monitor pulses, edema, hct to ensure no bleed into joint
   - orthopedics recs
   NSTEMI: elevated troponin, had cardiac catherization showing mild
   nonobstructive disease. Possibly autolysed lesion, or had coronary
   spasm peri-fall. Patient may have had takutsubo with hip fracture. EF
   45%
   - Aspirin decreased from 325mg to 81mg since no stent
   - can discontinue plavix 75
   - daily EKG
   -continue metoprolol at increased dose of 25mg PO BID
   - ECHO showing EF 40%, Mild left regional regional systolic dysfunction
   with distal anterior, septal and apical hypokinesis c/w CAD. Mild
   mitral regurgitation
   Atrial Fibrillation/Pauses: appears that this is since [**3-24**]. RVR as
   fast as 160s. on the floor she was given 5mg iv lopressor and had 5s
   pause, appeared to be conversion pause. In CCU, about 30 minutes after
   metoprolol patient had >6s pause, asymptomatic but has been in sinus
   since.
   -continue metoprolol for rate control
   -initially started on amiodarone for rhythm control but found to be
   hyperthyroid so held
   -start coumadin for anticoagulation
   -need [**Doctor Last Name 2257**] of heart upon discharge
   -card follow up on d/c
   Hyperthyroid- by labs prior to starting
   -f/u thyroid antibodies
   -endocrine follow up as outpatient
   Mental Status Changes: Patient was A+OX3 prior to getting dilaudid on
   admissiont so suspect medication effect.
   -avoid sedatvies
   - head CT negative
   - use narcotics with caution
   Fever: to 102 on arrival to floor. patient had cough, but per neice it
   is chronic [**2-1**] smoking. denies abd pain, urinary complaints. may be
   related to hip, atelectasis
   - blood cultures
   - UA and culture
   - CXR: no infiltrate
   Systolic CHF: acuity is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] of 20% is low for a first NSTEMI.
   Repeat echo shows improvement of EF to 40% which may represent
   Takutsubo

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during a hip fracture from a mechanical fall. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed mild nonobstructive coronary artery disease. She is scheduled for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of her left hip today. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. She has a left hip fracture with associated pain, for which she will receive pain management and careful monitoring of pulses, edema, and hematocrit to ensure no bleeding into the joint. 

The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which started on 3/24. She has been converted to sinus rhythm and will continue on metoprolol for rate control. Initially, amiodarone was started for rhythm control but was held due to the patient's hyperthyroidism. Coumadin has been started for anticoagulation. 

Other assessments include mental status changes, fever, and possible acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), which may be related to the patient's recent NSTEMI. The ejection fraction (EF) has improved from 45% to 40% on repeat echocardiogram, possibly indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 

The patient's laboratory values show mild anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, slightly elevated white blood cell count, and normal electrolyte levels. Her blood cultures, urinalysis, and chest X-ray have been obtained. 

The patient has been placed on DNR/DNI status, with the exception of during procedures such as surgery or cardiac catheterization. She is being closely monitored in the ICU with appropriate prophylactic measures in place."

   Assessment and Plan
   78yo F with no past medical history transferred from OSH after having
   NSTEMI in setting of hip fracture from mechanical fall.
   Left hip fracture: patient getting ORIF of left hip today
   - Will manage pain, cautious with narcotics
   - sub q hep for dvt prophylaxis
   - Monitor pulses, edema, hct to ensure no bleed into joint
   - orthopedics recs
   NSTEMI: elevated troponin, had cardiac catherization showing mild
   nonobstructive disease. Possibly autolysed lesion, or had coronary
   spasm peri-fall. Patient may have had takutsubo with hip fracture. EF
   45%
   - Aspirin decreased from 325mg to 81mg since no stent
   - can discontinue plavix 75
   - daily EKG
   -continue metoprolol at increased dose of 25mg PO BID
   - ECHO showing EF 40%, Mild left regional regional systolic dysfunction
   with distal anterior, septal and apical hypokinesis c/w CAD. Mild
   mitral regurgitation
   Atrial Fibrillation/Pauses: appears that this is since [**3-24**]. RVR as
   fast as 160s. on the floor she was given 5mg iv lopressor and had 5s
   pause, appeared to be conversion pause. In CCU, about 30 minutes after
   metoprolol patient had >6s pause, asymptomatic but has been in sinus
   since.
   -continue metoprolol for rate control
   -initially started on amiodarone for rhythm control but found to be
   hyperthyroid so held
   -start coumadin for anticoagulation

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of a hip fracture from a mechanical fall. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed mild nonobstructive coronary artery disease, possibly an autolysed lesion or coronary spasm around the time of the fall. The patient may have had Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with hip fracture. Her ejection fraction (EF) is 45%. She is being managed with aspirin at a decreased dose of 81mg, discontinuation of Plavix 75, daily EKG monitoring, and increased metoprolol dose of 25mg PO BID. An echocardiogram showed an EF of 40%, mild left regional systolic dysfunction with distal anterior, septal, and apical hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD). Mild mitral regurgitation was also noted. The patient developed atrial fibrillation/pauses, which appeared to be since March 24th. She received intravenous lopressor and had a 5-second pause, followed by apparent conversion. In the CCU, she had a >6-second pause while on metoprolol but remained asymptomatic and converted to sinus rhythm. She will continue on metoprolol for rate control and amiodarone for rhythm control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a NSTEMI in the setting of a hip fracture from a mechanical fall. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed mild nonobstructive coronary artery disease. The patient is scheduled for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of her left hip today. 

Medical Complications:
1. Left hip fracture: The patient has a left hip fracture that will be treated with ORIF. Pain management, anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, monitoring of pulses and edema, and ensuring no bleeding into the joint are important considerations.
2. NSTEMI: The patient had an elevated troponin level, indicating a possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Aspirin has been decreased from 325 mg to 81 mg since no stent was placed, and Plavix can be discontinued. Daily EKG monitoring and an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% with mild left regional systolic dysfunction are significant findings.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient appears to have developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) as high as 160 beats per minute. A pause of more than 6 seconds occurred after administration of metoprolol, but the patient remained asymptomatic. R"

   Assessment and Plan
   78yo F with no past medical history transferred from OSH after having
   NSTEMI in setting of hip fracture from mechanical fall.
   Left hip fracture: patient had ORIF of left hip yesterday. Currently
   pain free.
   - Will manage pain, cautious with narcotics
   - sub q hep for dvt prophylaxis
   - Monitor pulses, edema, hct to ensure no bleed into joint
   - orthopedics recs
   - [**Name (NI) 2975**], PT, dsg will be changed POD#2 (Sunday) by ortho
   NSTEMI: elevated troponin, had cardiac catherization showing mild
   nonobstructive disease. Possibly autolysed lesion, or had coronary
   spasm peri-fall or may have had takotsubo with hip fracture. EF 45%
   - Aspirin decreased from 325mg to 81mg since no stent
   - discontinued plavix 75
   - daily EKG
   - add ace
   -continue metoprolol at increased dose of 25mg PO BID, uptitrate as
   tolerated
   - ECHO showing EF 40%, Mild left regional regional systolic dysfunction
   with distal anterior, septal and apical hypokinesis c/w CAD. Mild
   mitral regurgitation
   Atrial Fibrillation/Pauses: appears that this is since [**3-24**]. RVR as
   fast as 160s. on the floor she was given 5mg iv lopressor and had 5s
   pause, appeared to be conversion pause. In CCU, about 30 minutes after
   metoprolol patient had >6s pause, asymptomatic but has been in sinus
   since.
   -continue metoprolol for rate control, uptitrate as tolerated
   -initially started on amiodarone for rhythm control but found to be
   hyperthyroid so discontinued
   -coumadin started for anticoagulation
   -need [**Doctor Last Name 2257**] of heart upon discharge
   -card follow up on d/c
   Hyperthyroid- by labs prior to starting
   -f/u thyroid antibodies
   -endocrine follow up arranged as outpatient
   Mental Status Changes: Patient was A+OX3 prior to getting dilaudid on
   admissiont so suspect medication effect.
   -avoid sedatvies
   - head CT negative
   - use narcotics with caution
   Fever: to 102 on arrival to floor. patient had cough, but per niece it
   is chronic [**2-1**] smoking. denies abd pain, urinary complaints. may be
   related to hip, atelectasis. Now afebrile last 24 hours.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u urine culture
   - CXR: no infiltrate
   Systolic CHF: acuity is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] of 20% is low for a first NSTEMI.
   Repeat echo shows improvement of EF to 40-45% which may represent
   Takutsubo
s, stress related cardiomyopathy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a NSTEMI in the setting of a hip fracture from a mechanical fall. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the left hip yesterday and is currently pain-free.

The patient's medical conditions include an elevated troponin level, which was likely due to the NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization showed mild nonobstructive disease, possibly an autolysed lesion or coronary spasm peri-fall, or may have had Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with hip fracture. The ejection fraction (EF) is 45%. The patient is on aspirin and metoprolol, with plans to uptitrate as tolerated.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was given intravenous Lopressor, resulting in a 5-second pause and apparent conversion. In the CCU, the patient had a >6-second pause but was asymptomatic and remained in sinus rhythm since. The plan is to continue metoprolol for rate control and uptitrate as tolerated.

Other medical conditions include hyperthyroidism, mental status changes possibly related to medication effect, fever, and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The CHF acuity is unclear, and the repeat echo shows improvement of EF to 40-45%,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a NSTEMI in the setting of a hip fracture from a mechanical fall. She underwent orthopedic surgery for ORIF of her left hip and is currently in the ICU for close monitoring. The patient's condition includes an elevated troponin level, mild nonobstructive coronary artery disease, and a possible Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has been managed with metoprolol. Additionally, the patient has hyperthyroidism and mental status changes, potentially due to medication effects. She is at risk for systemic complications such as DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and surgery. She should receive subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
2. Stress ulcers: Due to the patient's critical condition and prolonged bed rest, there is an increased risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers can be used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is in the ICU and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures to prevent VAP should be implemented, including maintaining"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted to the ICU for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of a hip fracture from a mechanical fall. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the left hip yesterday and is currently pain-free.

The patient has several medical complications and potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. NSTEMI: The patient had an elevated troponin level and underwent cardiac catheterization showing mild nonobstructive disease. The cause of the NSTEMI may be autolysed lesion, coronary spasm peri-fall, or possible Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient is on aspirin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin.

2. Left Hip Fracture: The patient had a mechanical fall resulting in a hip fracture. She underwent ORIF of the left hip. There is a concern for bleeding into the joint, so the pulses, edema, and hematocrit levels will be monitored. The patient is on Lovemox for DVT prophylaxis.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been in atrial fibrillation since March 24th. She had a rapid ventricular response as high as 160 beats per minute. Metoprolol was started to control the rate, but the patient experienced a pause of more than 6 seconds. Am"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of no significant past medical history. She was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of a hip fracture from a mechanical fall. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the left hip fracture yesterday and is currently pain-free.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), a heart rate of 66 bpm, a blood pressure of 122/52 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented, with no neck stiffness or jugular venous distention. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or shifting dullness. The extremities show no edema, and the left hip shows a dislocation/displacement. There are no skin changes noted.

Laboratory results show an elevated leukocyte count of 233 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, an elevated troponin level of 131 mg/dL, a potassium level of 0.4 mg/dL, a sodium level of 24 mEq/L,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with no past medical history who was transferred from another facility after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of a hip fracture from a mechanical fall. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the left hip yesterday and is currently pain-free. The assessment includes management of pain, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, monitoring of pulses, edema, and hematocrit (Hct) to ensure no bleeding into the joint. Orthopedic recommendations have been provided.

The patient's NSTEMI is associated with elevated troponin levels, and cardiac catheterization showed mild nonobstructive disease. It is possible that the lesion was self-limiting, a result of coronary spasm peri-fall, or the patient may have had Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress-related cardiomyopathy) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%. The plan includes aspirin reduction from 325 mg to 81 mg since no stent was placed, discontinuation of Plavix 75, daily electrocardiogram (EKG), addition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, continuation of metoprolol at 25 mg orally twice daily with titration as tolerated, and an echocardiogram showing LVEF of 40% with mild left regional"
