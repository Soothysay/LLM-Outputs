","The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoglycemia and is currently on chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD5) dialysis. 

The patient experienced an episode of chest pain at 02:14 AM, which was severe and left-sided. Vitals were stable, and he received nitroglycerin sublingually along with cardiac enzymes being drawn. The patient also had another episode of chest pain overnight, but the EKG showed no new changes, and only a mild increase in troponin level was noted. The pain resolved on its own, and he received one dose of nitroglycerin sublingually. 

His allergies include no known drug allergies. He has been receiving infusions of furosemide (Lasix) since [**2165-1-14**] 12:09 AM. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent episodes of chest pain. 

On the flow sheet data as of [**2165-1-14**] 07:28 AM, his vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 71 bpm with a range of 68-91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/45 mm"

The patient presented to the intensive care unit (ICU) for [**Last Name (un)**] with complaints of chest pain. The chest pain resolved on its own, and the patient received one dose of nitroglycerin sublingually.

Upon admission, the patient was found to have an elevated blood glucose level of 185 mg/dL. The patient underwent a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the evening, but is now hemodynamically stable and well-oriented.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 167/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed no acute distress, normal eye examination, normocephalic head, and normal cardiovascular examination. However, the patient had diminished right dorsal pedal pulse and was not assessed for the left dorsal pedal pulse. The respiratory examination showed fairly clear lungs with some coarse upper airway noises and bibasilar crackles.

   Assessment/Plan:
   1) Unresponsive episode
 unclear etiology of the above episode but
   patient currently alert and oriented and with no complaints.  It is
   plausible that this was a vagal response and that patient never
   actually lost pulses as evidenced by rapid improvement without need for
   intubation.   [**Month (only) 51**] also have had some contributions from the acidosis or
   even hyperkalemia but post-event levels were not significant enough to
   explain event so unlikely

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. The patient was initially admitted for hypoglycemia (fasting blood glucose level of 38) and acute-on-chronic renal failure. On January 13th in the evening, the patient was found unresponsive and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Immediate resuscitative efforts were performed, including epinephrine administration and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), resulting in the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Post-arrest, the patient was alert and oriented, but had high blood pressure of 220/110 mmHg, so cooling was not initiated. The patient was then transferred to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events:

- Blood glucose level increased from 38 to 182.
- Potassium level increased from 4.4 to 5.2.
- The patient complained of anterior chest pain overnight, which resolved.
- 12-lead EKG remained unchanged.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5. He presented to the hospital for hypoglycemia and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest this evening. The patient is hemodynamically stable and alert with normal vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PEA arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which is a type of cardiac arrest where there is no effective cardiac output. The cause of the arrest is unclear, but possible factors include severe acidosis, pulmonary embolism (PE), or myocardial infarction (MI). Further investigation is needed to determine the exact etiology.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Given the patient's history of ESRD and recent hypoglycemic event, there is a risk of AKI. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent further deterioration.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level upon arrival to the MICU was 185 mg/dL, indicating hyperglycemia. Close monitoring of blood sugars and management of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He presented to the hospital with hypoglycemia and is currently in the ICU. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest this evening, which was successfully resuscitated. He remains hemodynamically stable and alert. The cause of the arrest is unclear, but it may be related to food intake and opiate use. There are no signs of myocardial infarction, and a CT scan of the head did not reveal any bleeding. The patient's blood glucose level was normal during the code, and cultures have not shown any infections so far. The differential diagnosis includes possible aspiration versus pneumonia, with a questionable left retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray. The patient has anemia, but no obvious source of bleeding, and has been transfused one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC). He also has chronic systolic heart failure and is being considered for treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a beta-blocker. The patient is also on chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 and initially did not agree to hemodialysis (HD), but now agrees to initiate HD during this hospitalization. He also has scrotal edema and pain, likely due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was admitted to the ICU for worsening renal failure and hypoglycemia. On the evening of [**2165-1-14**], the patient experienced an unresponsive episode and bradycardia, leading to a code blue. He was intubated and sedated, with a blood pressure ranging from 180-220 mmHg. A chest X-ray showed a questionable left retrocardiac opacity. The patient's hemoglobin concentration decreased from 27.0% to 22.7% overnight, and he received a blood transfusion. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at 500 mL tidal volume, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 16 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His oxygen saturation is 100% on FiO2 of 40%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's inability to protect his airway and the potential risk of aspiration, there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia. This is further supported by the presence of bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation.

2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a sudden cardiac arrest, which required resuscitation efforts. The exact"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoglycemia and acute kidney injury. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest this evening, which was successfully resuscitated. He remains intubated and sedated. There are no clear precipitating events leading to the arrest. The patient's hemodynamics are currently stable, and he is alert and oriented. However, he has a history of anemia and is receiving packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (CPAP/PSV mode) due to his inability to protect his airway. There is a risk of respiratory failure if his respiratory function does not improve.

2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest this evening, which could be due to various causes such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or severe hypotension. There is a risk of recurrent cardiac arrest if the underlying cause is not identified and treated.

3. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD and requires dialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function if appropriate dialysis is not provided.

4. Infection: The presence of scrotal edema and pain raises"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a male with a history of chronic kidney disease (ESRD) who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is unresponsiveness, and other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and pulmonary edema. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 160/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a pressure support of 10 cmH2O, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows mild CO2 retention. 

The patient has been on hemodialysis and is receiving medications such as hydralazine for blood pressure control, lopressor for rate control, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed pneumonia. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and slightly low potassium levels. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, warm skin, and bilateral chest pain. The patient has edema in the right lower extremity and absent edema in the left lower"

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD): HD today,
   continue BP control with hydral prn, and low dose lopressor if he can
   swallow.
Nausea: will cycle enzymes, EKG shows some anterior TWI, likely post
   HD reaction.
Altered mental status: ? related to lack of sleep overnight, may also
   be secondary to compazine. On broad spectrum antibiotitcs for
   presumpting Pneumonia. ABG shows mild CO2 retention liekly c/w OSA..
   will need sleep study as outpatient.
Aspiration pneumonia: Will contineu antibitoics pending cx finalized

   stable and mentating well.
   # MS changes during this stay- Etiology unclear, has had CT Abdomen, CT
   head overnight [**1-16**] both which are unrevealing. Currently pts mental
   status is back at his baseline, A&O x3 and very appropriate and
   responsive. Patient may have had seizure during this episode vs apneic
   episode (could desaturation when he sleeps; monitors show when on back
   asleep he has 8sec apenic episodes and desats to the 70s).  ABG during
   unresponsive episode only showed mild hypercapnea with a normal pH.
   Neurology was consulted and getting EEG currently.  Additionally,
   infection may play role (CXR with possible retrocardiac opacity but no
   sputum, afebrile during hospital stay, no wbc, and culture data
   negative to date). Compazine given for nausea may also play a role.
   -Follow neurology recs
   - Follow up EEG
    -F/u culture data
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Will stop antibiotics and see how he does as no sign of infection to
   this point
   -Trial of CPAP for possible OSA which may be contributing
   -Avoid narcotics
   #. Nausea/Vomiting: Pt with nausea and vomiting. No evidence of new ECG
   changes, although some lateral twi.  Could be secondary to dialysis.
   CT-head negative yesterday.   CT Abdomen and LFTs unrevealing at this
   point
   -Reglan PRN
   - Avoid compazine as sedating and can cause MS changes
   # Scrotal pain: Significant scrotal edema, appreciate Urology
   evaluation, no evidence of ischemia or paraphymosis in this circumcised
   man. Evaluated by urology with no changes to plan
   - Scrotal elevation
   - Pain control
   # ANEMIA: No obvious source of bleeding, hemolysis labs negative.
   Patient transfused 1 unit PRBC
   - Monitor
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Will hold off on beta blockers for
   now, would start carvedilol at low dose if no further bradycardic
   episodes are observed
   -- Resume Norvasc, continue BB
   -- Discuss with renal if can start ACE

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He is currently in the ICU for hypoglycemia and cardiac arrest. 

The patient has experienced several new episodes of depressed mental status, with one episode lasting overnight. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed intraperitoneal fluid and a right lower pole mass, although no obvious obstruction was found. The patient's nighttime CPAP was held due to concerns of aspiration. Blood pressure spikes were observed, which responded well to IV hydralazine. The patient also has left upper extremity edema and scrotal edema, for which US and urology evaluation were ordered, respectively.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/59 to 95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin T levels. Blood cultures are negative for C. difficile and show sparse respiratory flora with rare growth of gram-negative rods.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and currently admitted for hypoglycemia. He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest this evening but is now hemodynamically stable and mentally alert.

24-hour events:
- New episodes of depressed mental status
- CT scan abdomen with effusions, intraperitoneal fluid, right lower pole mass, no obvious obstruction
- Nighttime CPAP held due to concern of aspiration
- Blood pressure spikes responded well to 5 mg IV Hydralazine
- Left upper extremity edema
- Ultrasound ordered

Assessment and plan:
- Hypertension, benign
- Altered mental status (not delirium)
- Nausea/vomiting
- Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
- Anemia, other
- Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough)
- Cardiac arrest
- Renal failure, end stage (ESRD)

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect the airway and potential use of nighttime CPAP increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of bibasilar crackles on physical examination"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress. They have a history of hypertension, benign and currently on low-dose metoprolol with a plan to resume home medication. The patient also has altered mental status, which may be related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) exacerbated by volume overload. An EEG is pending for further evaluation. There is a previous unresponsive episode that improved over time. The patient has been sensitive to medications, including Compazine and narcotics. A trial of CPAP overnight is planned.

The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, which could be due to gastroparesis or a post hemodialysis reaction. An abdominal CT scan has been done, but results are not mentioned.

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Fluid removal with ultrafiltration (UF) will continue. The rest of the plan will be managed by the hemodialysis team.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 82 bpm with a range of 74-91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/59 mmHg to 95/0 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute with a range of 10-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, benign, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient has been admitted to the ICU for cardiac arrest, where he was successfully resuscitated. 

From the review of systems, the patient has had nausea/vomiting, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), anemia (other), inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), and renal failure (ESRD).

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 160/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 88.2 kg, and height is 64 inches.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 700 mL of total fluids, 240 mL of PO intake, 100 mL of IVF intake, and output of 3,680 mL of total output, including 680 mL of urine output. The patient has right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and scrotal edema.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine levels, along with low hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count"

   70 yo male with ESRD, CHF (EF 30%), DM2, here for [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD5 and
   hypoglycemia who is s/p PEA arrest now w/intermittent MS changes,
   pneumonia
   # MS changes during this stay- Etiology unclear, has had CT Abdomen, CT
   head [**1-16**] both which are unrevealing. Currently pts mental status is
   back at his baseline, A&O x3 and very appropriate and responsive.
   Patient may have had seizure during this episode vs apneic episode
   (could desaturation when he sleeps; monitors show when on back asleep
   he has 8sec apenic episodes and desats to the 70s).  ABG during
   unresponsive episode only showed mild hypercapnea with a normal pH.
   Neurology was consulted and getting EEG currently.  Additionally,
   infection may play role (CXR with possible retrocardiac opacity but no
   sputum, afebrile during hospital stay, no wbc, and culture data
   negative to date). Compazine given for nausea may also play a role.
   -Follow neurology recs- will continue EEG monitoring for add
l 24 hrs
    -F/u culture data
   - Hold sedating medications
   -Have stopped antibiotics as no sign of infection
   -Continue CPAP at night
   -Avoid narcotics
   #Tracheal Deviation on CXR- etiology unclear, per radiology recommended
   thyroid U/S and CT chest to better evaluate
   -TSH wnl
   - Follow up CT chest
   - Follow up thyroid ultrasound
   #. Nausea/Vomiting: Pt with nausea and vomiting. No evidence of new ECG
   changes, although some lateral twi.  Could be secondary to dialysis.
   CT-head negative .   CT Abdomen and LFTs unrevealing at this point
   -Erythromycin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Avoid compazine as sedating and can cause MS changes
   # Scrotal pain: Significant scrotal edema, appreciate Urology
   evaluation, no evidence of ischemia or paraphymosis in this circumcised
   man. Evaluated by urology with no changes to plan
   - Scrotal elevation
   - Pain control
   # ANEMIA: No obvious source of bleeding, hemolysis labs negative.
   Patient has received 1 unit since ICU stay
   - Monitor
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Will hold off on beta blockers for
   now, would start carvedilol at low dose if no further bradycardic
   episodes are observed
   -- Resume Norvasc, continue BB
   -- Discuss with renal if can start ACE
   # ESRD:
   - HD today
   - f/u renal recs
   # DM2: continue ISS
   # HTN:

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic heart failure (EF 30%), diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypoglycemia. He was admitted for a medical condition and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, after which he had intermittent mental status changes. He is now alert and oriented x3, but may have had a seizure or apneic episode during the episode. He has pneumonia and tracheal deviation on chest X-ray, which is being further evaluated with a thyroid ultrasound and CT chest. He also has scrotal edema, anemia, chronic systolic heart failure, and hypertension. He requires ongoing management for various conditions including nausea/vomiting, pain control, altered mental status, and airway protection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal deviation: The patient's chest X-ray shows tracheal deviation, which could indicate an enlarging thyroid mass. Further evaluation with a thyroid ultrasound and CT chest is recommended to determine the etiology.
2. Intermittent mental status changes: The patient experienced episodes of altered mental status, which could be due to various causes such as infection, seizures, or medication side effects. Continuous EEG monitoring is being continued to assess for any seizure activity.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, as evidenced by positive cultures for gram-negative rods. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored based on culture"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. They have tracheal deviation on CXR, which is concerning for a thyroid mass. The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension and altered mental status. They also have nausea/vomiting, pain control issues, and anemia. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires dialysis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they do have right lower extremity edema. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complication: Tracheal deviation may indicate a thyroid mass compressing the airway, which can lead to respiratory distress or obstruction.
2. Cardiovascular Complication: The patient has hypertension, which could worsen and lead to complications such as heart failure or myocardial infarction.
3. Renal Complication: The patient's elevated creatinine and potassium levels suggest renal dysfunction. Without proper management, this could progress to acute kidney injury or further deterioration of renal function.
4. Infectious Complication: The presence of gram-negative rods in sputum indicates a possible infection. If left untreated, this could lead to pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Neurological Complication: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various causes, including medication effects or underlying neurological conditions. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and prevent potential neurological decline.

   head [**1-16**] both which are unrevealing. Currently pts mental status is
   back at his baseline, A&O x3 and very appropriate and responsive.
   Patient may have had seizure during this episode vs apneic episode
   (could desaturation when he sleeps; monitors show when on back asleep
   he has 8sec apenic episodes and desats to the 70s).  ABG during
   unresponsive episode only showed mild hypercapnea with a normal pH.
   Neurology was consulted and getting EEG currently.  Additionally,
   infection may play role (CXR with possible retrocardiac opacity but no
   sputum, afebrile during hospital stay, no wbc, and culture data
   negative to date). Compazine given for nausea may also play a role.
   -Follow up EEG
    -F/u culture data
   - Hold sedating medications
   -Have stopped antibiotics as no sign of infection
   -Continue CPAP at night
   -Avoid narcotics
   #Tracheal Deviation on CXR- etiology unclear, per radiology recommended
   thyroid U/S and CT chest to better evaluate
   -TSH wnl
   - Follow up CT chest- to be done today
   - Follow up thyroid ultrasound
   #. Nausea/Vomiting: Pt with nausea and vomiting. No evidence of new ECG
   changes, although some lateral twi.  Could be secondary to dialysis.
   CT-head negative .   CT Abdomen and LFTs unrevealing at this point. Now
   resolved.
   -Erythromycin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Avoid compazine as sedating and can cause MS changes
   # Scrotal pain: Significant scrotal edema, appreciate Urology
   evaluation, no evidence of ischemia or paraphymosis in this circumcised
   man. Evaluated by urology with no changes to plan
   - Scrotal elevation
   - Pain control
   # ANEMIA: No obvious source of bleeding, hemolysis labs negative.
   Patient has received 1 unit since ICU stay
   - Monitor
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Will hold off on beta blockers for
   now, would start carvedilol at low dose if no further bradycardic
   episodes are observed
   -- Resume Norvasc, continue BB
   -- Discuss with renal if can start ACE

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and chronic systolic heart failure. He was admitted for hypoglycemia and currently has intermittent myocardial stunning (MS) changes, pneumonia, and intermittent altered mental status.

The patient had a previous pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and has been experiencing intermittent MS changes during this stay. His mental status has returned to baseline, but there may have been a seizure or apneic episode during the episode. Neurology was consulted, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) is currently being obtained. Infection may also play a role, as indicated by the chest X-ray showing a possible retrocardiac opacity.

The patient has tracheal deviation on the chest X-ray, which is unclear in etiology. A thyroid ultrasound and CT chest are recommended for further evaluation. The patient also experienced nausea and vomiting, which has since resolved. There are no new ECG changes, and CT scans of the head and abdomen, as well as liver function tests, have been unrevealing.

The patient has significant scrotal edema and is awaiting urology evaluation. There is no evidence of ischemia or paraph"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with ESRD, CHF (EF 30%), DM2, here for [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD5 and
   hypoglycemia who is s/p PEA arrest now w/intermittent MS changes,
   pneumonia
   # MS changes during this stay- Etiology unclear, has had CT Abdomen, CT
   head [**1-16**] both which are unrevealing. Currently pts mental status is
   back at his baseline, A&O x3 and very appropriate and responsive.
   Patient may have had seizure during this episode vs apneic episode
   (could desaturation when he sleeps; monitors show when on back asleep
   he has 8sec apenic episodes and desats to the 70s).  ABG during
   unresponsive episode only showed mild hypercapnea with a normal pH.
   Neurology was consulted and getting EEG currently.  Additionally,
   infection may play role (CXR with possible retrocardiac opacity but no
   sputum, afebrile during hospital stay, no wbc, and culture data
   negative to date). Compazine given for nausea may also play a role.
   - Follow up EEG (pending)
    -F/u culture data
   - Hold sedating medications
   -Have stopped antibiotics as no sign of infection
   -does not tolerate CPAP, will discontinue
   -Avoid narcotics
   #Tracheal Deviation on CXR- etiology unclear, per radiology recommended
   thyroid U/S and CT chest to better evaluate
   -TSH wnl
   - Follow up CT chest- to be done today
   - Follow up thyroid ultrasound
   #. Nausea/Vomiting: Pt with nausea and vomiting. No evidence of new ECG
   changes, although some lateral twi.  Could be secondary to dialysis.
   CT-head negative .   CT Abdomen and LFTs unrevealing at this point. Now
   resolved.
   -Erythromycin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Avoid compazine as sedating and can cause MS changes
   # Scrotal pain: Significant scrotal edema, appreciate Urology
   evaluation, no evidence of ischemia or paraphymosis in this circumcised
   man. Evaluated by urology with no changes to plan
   - Scrotal elevation
   - Pain control
   # ANEMIA: No obvious source of bleeding, hemolysis labs negative.
   Patient has received 1 unit since ICU stay
   - Monitor
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Will hold off on beta blockers for
   now, would start carvedilol at low dose if no further bradycardic
   episodes are observed
   -- Resume Norvasc, continue BB
   -- Discuss with renal if can start ACE
   # ESRD:
   - HD Monday, ?  UF today
   - f/u renal recs
   # DM2: continue ISS
   # HTN:
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Start home Norvasc 5mg titrate prn
   - hydral IV prn for SBP >150

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension. He presented with hypoglycemia and is currently in the ICU for pneumonia and intermittent myocardial (MS) changes. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest but has since recovered with no lasting mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has developed scrotal edema and ulcerations around the meatus, indicating possible impaired skin integrity.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with metoprolol and Norvasc.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has experienced intermittent MS changes, which could be due to various factors such as infection, medication (Compazine), or seizures. An EEG is pending to further evaluate the situation.
4. Nausea/vomiting: The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, but this has now resolved.
5. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute pain from scrotal edema and chronic pain due to CHF.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but no obvious source of bleeding has been identified. Hemolysis labs are negative.
7. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%. Beta-block"

   Assessment and Plan
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY:
   barrier cream to the penis
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN:
   needs better control will titrate up evening norvasc, continue bblocker
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): resolved suspect this was in
   the setting of narcotics/compazine, + mild OSA. didnot tolerate CPAP
 NAUSEA / VOMITING: improved on erythromcyin
 ANEMIA, OTHER: minimize blood draws
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
 Cough: some cough this am.. wil follow CT of chest that's to be
   obtained for his thyroid.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The note details the patient's vital signs, lab results, and treatment plan.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has penile skin erosions, which indicates impaired skin integrity. Applying barrier cream to the penis may help prevent further damage.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, indicating hypertension. The plan is to better control the hypertension by titrating up evening Norvasc and continuing with a beta-blocker.

3. Altered mental status: The patient had resolved altered mental status, possibly related to medications such as narcotics and compazine. Mild OSA was also mentioned.

4. Nausea/vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting improved with erythromycin.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and efforts should be made to minimize blood draws.

6. Airway protection issues: The patient has an inability to protect their airway, increasing the risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance. A CT scan of the chest is planned to assess the patient's thyroid.

7. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires dialysis on Monday.

These are the potential medical complications identified based on the provided progress note."
