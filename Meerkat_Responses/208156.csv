","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, who was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and nausea/vomiting. The arterial line was started at 03:00 PM on [**2157-10-18**]. The patient's family decided to make him DNR/DNI during a family meeting. The patient has allergies to sulfonamides and ACE inhibitors, and a rash developed after taking protonix. The patient's last dose of antibiotics, ciprofloxacin, was given at 11:00 AM on [**2157-10-18**]. The patient is currently receiving dopamine infusion at 4 mcg/kg/min. Other medications include Kayexelate. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70-72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/41-105/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for decreased urine output. The patient's blood products and fluid balance are within normal limits. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen but not on mechanical ventilation. The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels and decreased hemoglobin. The physical examination findings are mostly not assessed. The patient's assessment and plan include nausea/vomiting, hypotension, chronic renal failure, impaired physical mobility, and altered mental status. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code and disposition is pending further evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's history of chronic renal failure and current presentation, potential medical complications may include worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, infection (due to decreased urine output and recent antibiotic use), and pressure ulcers (due to impaired physical mobility). Additionally, the patient's altered mental status could be a concern for delirium or other neurological complications. Close monitoring and management of these potential complications will be necessary for the patient's well-being."

   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial.  Could be [**1-22**] infection with UA
   concerning for UTI.  Otherwise afebrile and without leukocytsois.
   Other considerations include dehydration given physical exam, ARF and
   increased Torsemide/Valsartan.
   -A line placed
   - Treat UA with IV Cipro
   - Hold Torsemide, Valsartan and Carvedilol
   .
   # ARF on CRI.  CKD baseline Cr 2-2.2.  Worsened during last hospital
   course.  Attributed to starting Torsemide and Valsartan, but discharged
   on these medications despite this.  Hyperkalemia likely attributable to
   worsened renal function.  Likely prerenal, but will send urine studies
   to assess.
   - Urine osms, lytes, sediment
   - Hold Torsemide/Valsartan
   - Continue Sevelamer, check phos, consider d/c if improves
   - Renal diet once diet advanced
   - Consider renal u/s if no improvement
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely [**1-22**] ARF on CRI.  EKG without changes concerning
   for life-threatening hyperkalemia.
   - Repeat electrolytes
   - If continued hyperkalemia, would give kayexelate
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline.  On last admission attributed to his CRI.
   Discharged on ProCrit and iron.  +Guaiac positive in ED.  Would not

   # Falls: Likely [**1-22**] physical decline given repeat hospitalization, as
   well as possible AMS with UTI, iron, electrolyte abnormalities and
   hypotension.
   - d/c iron
   - treat UTI
   - Give fluid for hypotension
   - PT/OT consults after improvement ?safe to d/c home vs placement

   # UTI: UA positive in ED.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Continue Cipro

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple medical conditions, including type II diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), chronic renal failure (CRF) requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRI), and sensory deficits including bilateral vision loss and hearing loss. The patient's recent hospital course has been complicated by an infection with possible urinary tract infection (UTI), acute kidney injury (ARF), hypotension, hyperkalemia, anemia, falls, and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to a combination of factors, including infection, dehydration, acute renal failure, and medications such as Torsemide and Valsartan. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine levels indicate chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the recent worsening of renal function may be attributed to the initiation of Torsemide and Valsartan. Holding these medications and conducting urine studies to assess the type of renal injury are essential. Further evaluation with renal ultrasound if no improvement is observed.

3. Hyperkalemia: The elevated potassium levels are likely related to"

   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial.  Could be [**1-22**] infection with UA
   concerning for UTI.  On cipro, but has been afebrile and without
   leukocytosis.  Other considerations include dehydration given physical
   exam, ARF and increased Torsemide/Valsartan.  Received almost 3L of IVF
   yesterday

   # ARF on CRI.  CKD baseline Cr 2-2.2.  Worsened during last hospital
   course.  Attributed to starting Torsemide and Valsartan, but discharged
   on these medications despite this.  Hyperkalemia likely attributable to
   worsened renal function.  Urine lytes consistent with prerenal
   etiology.  Patient is not a candidate for dialysis.
   - Hold Torsemide/Valsartan
   - Continue Sevelamer, check phos, consider d/c if improves
   - Renal consult
   - Renal diet once diet advanced
   - Consider renal u/s if no improvement

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with hypotension and low urine output. His labs showed hyperkalemia. The family meeting last night decided on a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) and no hemodialysis (HD) plan. The patient is currently on dopamine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to hypovolemia or septic shock. The hypotension may further complicate his condition and potentially lead to organ failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which is likely multifactorial due to medications such as torsemide and losartan, hypovolemia, and possibly sepsis from a urinary tract infection (UTI). The renal failure may worsen his overall condition.
3. UTI: The patient is being treated for a UTI with ciprofloxacin. If the infection spreads or becomes more severe, it could lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels need to be managed carefully, as hyperkalemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Pulmonary Edema: Gentle fluids are being given to the"

   on these medications despite this.  Hyperkalemia likely attributable to
   worsened renal function.  Urine lytes consistent with prerenal
   etiology.  Family does not want to pursue dialysis.
   - Hold Torsemide/Valsartan

","The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and falls. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition and medical history. 

1. Hypotension: The patient is being treated with dopamine to keep blood pressure above 100 due to renal recommendations. The goal is to wean dopamine with a blood pressure goal of >90 systolic and mean arterial pressure (MAP) >50.

2. ARF: The patient has worsening renal function with a baseline creatinine level of 2-2.2. His hyperkalemia is likely due to the worsened renal function. The family does not want to pursue dialysis.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels have improved today. Kayexalate is given as needed, and electrolytes are checked daily.

4. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia attributed to his CKD. He is on ProCrit and iron. A transfusion would only be considered if there is an acute drop in hemoglobin (Hb) by more than 3 points or hematocrit (Hct) below 21%, or evidence of end-organ ischemia.

   Assessment and Plan
 # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial.  Could be [**1-22**] infection with UA
   concerning for UTI.  On cipro, but has been afebrile and without
   leukocytosis.  Other considerations include dehydration given physical
   exam, ARF and increased Torsemide/Valsartan.  Received almost 3L of IVF
   yesterday
   - A line placed
   - Cont. dopamine to maintain SBP
   - On Cipro for presumed UA
   - Hold Torsemide, Valsartan and Carvedilol
   .
   # ARF on CRI.  CKD baseline Cr 2-2.2.  Worsened during last hospital
   course.  Attributed to starting Torsemide and Valsartan, but discharged
   on these medications despite this.  Hyperkalemia likely attributable to
   worsened renal function.  Urine lytes consistent with prerenal
   etiology.  Patient is not a candidate for dialysis.
   - Hold Torsemide/Valsartan
   - Continue Sevelamer, check phos, consider d/c if improves
   - Renal consult
   - Renal diet once diet advanced
   - Consider renal u/s if no improvement
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely [**1-22**] ARF on CRI.  EKG without changes concerning
   for life-threatening hyperkalemia.
   - Repeat electrolytes, continue checking EKG
   - Kayexelate
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline.  On last admission attributed to his CRI.
   Discharged on ProCrit and iron.  +Guaiac positive in ED.  Would not
   transfuse unless acute drop > 3pt or Hct <21 or e/o end organ ischemia.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT
   - Guaiac stools
   - Hold iron for ?contribution to AMS
   .
   # Falls: Likely [**1-22**] physical decline given repeat hospitalization, as
   well as possible AMS with UTI, iron, electrolyte abnormalities and
   hypotension.
   - d/c iron
   - treat UTI
   - Give fluid for hypotension
   - PT/OT consults after improvement ?safe to d/c home vs placement
   .
   # UTI: UA positive in ED.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Continue Cipro
   .
   # Type II diabetes mellitus: Hold Glipizide. Monitor on ISS with QID
   FS.
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG in [**2127**]: On ASA, BB. Hold BB for hypotension, will
   restart as able.
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # BPH s/p TURP: On tamsulosin as outpatient.  Foley in place.
   - Hold tamsulosin given hypotenion
   - d/c Foley soon
   - Restart Tamsulosin once improved
   .
   # Sensory deficits: B/L vision loss and hearing loss.  [**Month (only) 51**] worsen AMS
   and contribute to hospital acquired delirium.
   - Orient frequently
   - Discuss with family

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

- The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications.
- They have a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are currently experiencing acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient's blood pressure is low, and they are being treated with dopamine to maintain stable blood pressure.
- They have an infection with urinary alkalinization, for which they are receiving antibiotics.
- The patient has hyperkalemia, likely due to worsened renal function, and is being treated with Kayexalate.
- They have anemia, which is attributed to their CKD.
- The patient has been experiencing falls, possibly due to physical decline, AMS (acute mental status changes), UTI (urinary tract infection), iron, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypotension.
- They have a positive urine analysis indicating a urinary tract infection.
- The patient has type II diabetes mellitus and is being monitored closely.
- They have a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG surgery and are on aspirin and beta-blockers.
- The patient has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with previous transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
- Sensory deficits, including bilateral vision loss and hearing loss, are contributing to worsening AMS and hospital-acquired delirium.
