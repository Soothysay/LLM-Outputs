   O/n events
   Renal consulted.
   Felt unlikely an RTA- acute buffering mechanisms raise bicarb by a few
   points in metabolic acidosis, renal compensation driven by ammonia
   takes several days - she is compensating appropriately. Unable to shed
   light on hypocalcemia.
   Access:
   2 20 gauge needles in R arm, 22 in left
   Plan:
   Metabolic Acidosis: AG from OSH on arrival 14, with bicarb 11 despite
   bicarb gtt, with expected PCO2 demonstrating compensation. Mixed
   picture of AG and non-AG acidosis most likely secondary to volume
   depletion, hypotension with subsequent lactic acidosis in setting of
   diarrhea. Diarrhea decreased, acidosis persisted longer, however is
   less acidemic currently however continues to have hypokalemia despite
   resolved acidosis,despite getting lasix, with low bicarb which
   initially raised the q of RTA. According to renal u can't invoke an RTA
   in setting of ARF, only when kidney's are otherwise normal.
   However, consistent with distal RTA (not excreting H+). - Urine Ca
   pending.
    Per renal, in setting metabolic acidosis initially buffering
   mechanisms increase bicarb slightly, however may take kidney several
   days to return to nl bicarb via ammonia excreting dependent mechanisms.
   Most recent ABG of:
   Is gap closed:
   Is still compensated:
   Continue IVF (LR given hyperchloremia).
   Continue to monitor stool output.
   Repeat ABG with lactate if not closed.
   F/U urine/serum tox to confirm no other cause gap acidosis.
   f/u UA for urine lytes (eval for ATN, RTA) also check ketones (DKA as a
   cause for mixed acidosis).
   f/u renal recs.
   Pt is florid, red, could she be Cushingoid, Cohns?
   Metabolic derangements:
   Hypocalcemia, sort of higher phosphate: is this hypoparathyroidism?
   Urine Calcium pending.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: per report pt required BIPAP prior to
   transfer, but found to be sating in mid 90s on floor with 2LNC. Pt had
   vomiting, + EGD y/d? with potential for aspiration, however would
   expect R lung, not left, and would not expect involvement of entire
   lung parenchyma.
   No s/s suspicious for hemo/chylothorax (which would be?).Low suspicion,
   no abx. ***
   CXR showed new, dependent pulmonary edema and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 7808**] indicating
   CHF, however given renal failure, diuresis deferred at this time. Also
   pt's respiratory status is quite stable.
    -repeat CXR
   -repeat ABG
   - aspiration precautions.
   Hypotension:
   Resolved: Initially held antihypertensives, however pt's systolic bps
   in 140s in pm. Restarted metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] (home dose?).
   Continuing to hold amlodipine, lisinopril, hydral for now.
   ARF: Cr increased to peak 3.4 at OSH. Felt secondary to volume
   depletion and possible AIN from NSAID use prior to admission.
   Unclear etiology. Pt at risk for abuse? Urine positive for
   benzos/alcohol. Serum?
   Hypotension leading to some ischemia - ATN vs toxin - following tox
   screen, vs NSAID abuse.
   IVF repletion.
   f/u urine lytes *
   f/u renal recs
   Avoid nephrotoxins including NSAIDS, hold lisinopril.
   Hypokalemia: likely related to acidemia, however acidemia resolved thus
   should not still be acidemic.
   Hypocalcemia: Ca at OSH 5.7, of unclear etiology. New since prior
   hospitalizations.
   Urine Ca?
   ? Hypoparathyroidism
   -Send albumin and Ca, ionized Ca
   -Trend Mg
   -Check PTH
   -Check Lipase/Amylase
   C.diff colitis: Per OSH records, pt was diagonsed with Ca.diff and
   started on p.o Vanc. Stopped on [**8-12**]. Now started on p.o vanc and IV
   flagyl for suspected recurrent C.diff. Unclear if prior C.diff toxins
   positive.
   -Likely primary contributor to her non gap acidosis.
   No diarrhea since arrival.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an ICU admitted individual with multiple medical complications. They have a history of alcohol abuse and were admitted with metabolic acidosis, possibly secondary to volume depletion and hypotension. The patient also has renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels, and is at risk for abuse, with positive urine toxicology for benzodiazepines and alcohol. There is ongoing concern for possible aspiration pneumonia, especially given the need for BIPAP prior to transfer. The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but further evaluation is needed. The patient's hypocalcemia and hypokalemia are unresolved. There is a concern for C. difficile colitis, which may be recurrent. The patient is being treated with IV flagyl and oral vancomycin. The patient's diabetes management is ongoing, and they have a history of knee septic arthritis/osteomyelitis caused by C. parapsilosis. The patient's skin condition includes red buttocks. Disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially presented with metabolic acidosis, which is still persisting. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal failure. It is important to monitor kidney function and manage the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, leading"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and vomiting. He has a history of alcohol abuse and diabetes mellitus. Upon arrival, the patient was found to have metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap, likely secondary to volume depletion and hypotension. The patient also presented with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and renal failure. Further evaluation revealed positive results for benzodiazepines and alcohol in the urine. The patient's respiratory status was unstable initially, requiring BiPAP, but improved to the point where he could maintain oxygenation on a low-flow nasal cannula. A chest X-ray showed new dependent pulmonary edema, and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) test indicated congestive heart failure (CHF). However, given the patient's stable respiratory status and renal failure, diuresis was deferred. 

Plan:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: Continue IV fluids with lactated Ringer's solution. Monitor stool output and repeat ABG to assess acid-base balance. Follow up with renal recommendations and evaluate for other causes of gap acidosis.
2. Hypotension: Restart metoprolol at home dose and continue to monitor blood pressure. Hold amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydralazine for now.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): Replete IV fluids and avoid nephro"

   Assessment and Plan
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
   Plan:
   Metabolic Acidosis: AG from OSH on arrival 14, with bicarb 11 despite
   bicarb gtt, with expected PCO2 demonstrating compensation. Mixed
   picture of AG and non-AG acidosis most likely secondary to volume
   depletion, hypotension with subsequent lactic acidosis in setting of
   diarrhea. Diarrhea decreased, acidosis persisted longer, however is
   less acidemic currently however continues to have hypokalemia despite
   resolved acidosis,despite getting lasix, with low bicarb which
   initially raised the q of RTA. According to renal u can't invoke an RTA
   in setting of ARF, only when kidney's are otherwise normal.
   However, consistent with distal RTA (not excreting H+). - Urine Ca
   pending.
    Per renal, in setting metabolic acidosis initially buffering
   mechanisms increase bicarb slightly, however may take kidney several
   days to return to nl bicarb via ammonia excreting dependent mechanisms.
   Gap is not closing but remains perfectly Compendsated.
   Continue IVF (LR given hyperchloremia).
   Continue to monitor stool output.
   Repeat ABG with lactate if not closed.
   F/U urine/serum tox to confirm no other cause gap acidosis.
   f/u UA for urine lytes (eval for ATN, RTA) also check ketones (DKA as a
   cause for mixed acidosis).
   f/u renal recs.
   Pt is florid, red, could she be Cushingoid, Cohns vs just alcoholic
   flushing>?
   Metabolic derangements:
   Hypocalcemia, sort of higher phosphate: Ca8.2 today thus  correcting,
   however in hypocalcemia can correct ocutely with repletion, and remain
   unable to maintain nl levels. ? Hypoparathyroidsm vs hypomagensium. Vs
   pseudohypoparathyroidism, vs rhabdomyolisis, vs osteomalacia.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: per report pt required BIPAP prior to
   transfer, but found to be sating in mid 90s on floor with 2LNC. Pt had
   vomiting, + EGD y/d? with potential for aspiration, however would
   expect R lung, not left, and would not expect involvement of entire
   lung parenchyma.
   No s/s suspicious for hemo/chylothorax (which would be?).Low suspicion,
   no abx. ***
   CXR showed new, dependent pulmonary edema and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 7808**] indicating
   CHF, however given renal failure, diuresis deferred at this time. Also
   pt's respiratory status is quite stable.
    -repeat CXR
   -repeat ABG
   - aspiration precautions.
   Hypotension:
   Resolved: Initially held antihypertensives, however pt's systolic bps
   in 140s in pm. Restarted metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] (home dose?).
   Continuing to hold amlodipine, lisinopril, hydral for now.
   ARF: Cr increased to peak 3.4 at OSH. Felt secondary to volume
   depletion and possible AIN from NSAID use prior to admission.
   Unclear etiology. Pt at risk for abuse? Urine positive for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman who was transferred to the ICU with severe metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure (ARF). She has a history of chronic illness, severe volume depletion, and profound diarrhea. The patient has been experiencing bicarbonate wasting and respiratory distress, with asymmetrical pulmonary edema and left-sided predominant infiltrate on chest X-ray. There are concerns for decompressed congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient also has Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, hypocalcemia, knee fungal infection, hypertension, and a history of ethanol abuse with potential evolving withdrawal symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a mixed anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. This condition can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have peaked at 3.4 and are now at 2.0. ARF can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremic toxicity, and increased risk of infections.
3. Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress with asymmetrical pulmonary edema and left-sided predominant infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests possible decompressed CHF. This condition can lead to inadequate oxygenation, respiratory failure, and potentially cardiac arrest.

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with severe metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury (ARF), hypoxemic respiratory distress, diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff), hypocalcemia, a possible fungal infection in the knee, hypertension, and a history of severe ethanol abuse.

The patient's condition is summarized as follows:
- She has a mixed picture of metabolic acidosis, both anion gap and non-anion gap.
- She is experiencing ARF with creatinine peaking at 3.4 and now at 2.0.
- She has hypoxemic respiratory distress with asymmetric pulmonary edema and left predominant infiltrate on chest X-ray, concerning for decompressed congestive heart failure (CHF).
- She has diarrhea caused by C. diff, for which the toxin will be repeated and she will be kept on Flagyl.
- She is hypocalcemic, possibly due to acidemia and poor intake.
- She has a suspected fungal infection in the knee, for which blood cultures will be checked and she will be kept on fluconazole.
- She has hypertension, which requires home agents.
- She has a history of severe DTs due to ethanol abuse, so it is important to stay ahead of this.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 171/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's physical examination reveals a dishelved chronically ill female who is alert and responsive. She has poor air movement on the left side with wheezing, a soft mildly tender abdomen, and a swollen right knee. Neurological examination shows that she is alert and responsive, knowing where she is.

Laboratory results include a serum sodium level of 130 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride level of 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 15 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 40 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, glucose level of 109 mg/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 30.6%, platelet count of 423 K/uL, and lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. Other lab results are provided in the note.

The patient's plan includes managing electrolyte and fluid disorders, treating metabolic acidosis, addressing ARF, managing hypoxemic respiratory distress, treating diarrhea caused by C. diff, monitoring hypocalcemia, treating a possible fungal infection in the knee, managing hypertension, and addressing ethanol abuse."

   less likely hemmorhge or HAP
   4.       Diarrrhea: C diff
 will repeat toxin and keep on Flagyl
   5.       Hypocalcemia: DDx academia poor intake
 replete and follow.
   Also check lipase as she is at rosk for acte pancreatitis.
   6.       Abd pain: check [**Doctor First Name **] and lipase
 low threshold for RUQ US, CT
   7.       High BNP- repeat here as was high at OSH- echos here last
   month were normal. Could she have acute thiamine deficiency and high
   output cardiac failure? Reokete thiamine and BNP- echo is she
   decompensates.
   8.       Knee Fungal Infection: check bklood cx, keep on Fluc.

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman who has been transferred from OSH with severe metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure (ARF). She has a mixed picture of anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The expected paCO2 is 24, and her last ABG was in line. It is likely that she initially had severe volume depletion and profound diarrhea, which then progressed to ARF and loss of concentrating ability. She appears to be bicarbonate wasting and is not responding to the bicarbonate drip and oral repletion, which may lead to respiratory alkalosis and further potassium and calcium losses. The urine should be checked for lytes, as well as serum and urine osmolarity. It would also be helpful to evaluate for ethylene glycol poisoning and assess for renal tubular acidosis (RTA) in addition to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient's creatinine peaked at 3.4 and is now 2.4. There are several differential diagnoses for her condition, including volume depletion, RTA, ATN, aspiration, acute pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She also has diarrhea, which may be caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). A repeat toxin test will be performed, and she will continue on Flagyl.

The patient is hypoxemic, and the possible causes include aspiration, acute pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, or HAP."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Endocarditis: The presence of new vegetation on the mitral valve, as seen on the echo, raises concern for endocarditis, especially considering the patient's history of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.

2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria. Further assessment is needed to determine the cause of ARF, and ongoing monitoring is required.

3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has hypokalemia (low potassium) and metabolic acidosis. These imbalances need to be corrected and monitored closely.

4. Hypertension: Despite antihypertensive medication, the patient's blood pressure remains elevated. Adjustments in medication or additional interventions may be necessary to manage this condition.

5. Infection: There is suspicion of C. difficile infection due to a previous diagnosis and recurrence. Appropriate antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and further evaluation is needed.

6. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and symptoms of withdrawal are present. Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are being used for symptom management.

7. Delirium: The patient is persistently confused and agitated, which may be indicative of delirium. Sedation with medications like diaz"

   Plan:
   Metabolic Acidosis: AG from OSH on arrival 14, with bicarb 11 despite
   bicarb gtt, with expected PCO2 demonstrating compensation. Mixed
   picture of AG and non-AG acidosis most likely secondary to volume
   depletion, hypotension with subsequent lactic acidosis in setting of
   diarrhea. Diarrhea decreased, acidosis persisted longer, however is
   less acidemic currently however continues to have hypokalemia despite
   resolved acidosis,despite getting lasix, with low bicarb which
   initially raised the q of RTA. According to renal u can't invoke an RTA
   in setting of ARF, only when kidney's are otherwise normal.
   f/u renal recs.
   Metabolic derangements:
   Hypocalcemia, sort of higher phosphate: Ca8.2 today thus  correcting,
   however in hypocalcemia can correct ocutely with repletion, and remain
   unable to maintain nl levels. ? Hypoparathyroidsm vs hypomagensium. Vs
   pseudohypoparathyroidism, vs rhabdomyolisis, vs osteomalacia.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: per report pt required BIPAP prior to
   transfer, but found to be sating in mid 90s on floor with 2LNC. Pt had
   vomiting, + EGD y/d? with potential for aspiration, however would
   expect R lung, not left, and would not expect involvement of entire
   lung parenchyma.
   No s/s suspicious for hemo/chylothorax (which would be?).Low suspicion,
   no abx. ***
   CXR showed new, dependent pulmonary edema and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 7808**] indicating
   CHF, however given renal failure, diuresis deferred at this time. Also
   pt's respiratory status is quite stable.
    -repeat CXR
   -repeat ABG
   - aspiration precautions.
   Hypertension:  had been hypotensive, holding antihypertensives, but
   during the day yesterday and especially during the evening pressures
   were persistently elevated, with mild tachycardia.
   -metoprolol switched to q3 IV dosing, at equivalent of previous home
   levels.
   -continue diazepam per CIWA protocol.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, currently admitted to the ICU for multiple medical complications.
- The patient has been experiencing intermittent agitation throughout the day, with diazepam administered per CIWA protocol. He remains persistently confused and uncooperative but not agitated, tremulous, or diaphoretic.
- The patient has been pulling out IV lines, and currently has two peripheral IVs in place.
- The patient's blood pressure and heart rate have been persistently elevated, which improved with a new dosing of metoprolol.
- An echocardiogram revealed 3 mm vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, which was not present in a TEE from seven months ago.
- Blood cultures were drawn, including fungal cultures. The patient is being treated with fluconazole, and ID consultation recommended increasing the dose now that renal function is improving.
- The patient is also at risk for retinal emboli, and ophthalmology consultation is recommended.
- The patient has allergies to Percocet, cefazolin, and Vicodin.
- The patient received several doses of antibiotics, including fluconazole, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
- The patient is on various infusions, including heparin sodium, diazepam, and metoprolol.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 176/82 mmHg to 191/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient has been receiving respiratory support with BIPAP prior to transfer but is currently stable on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine levels, low potassium, and other abnormalities.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals a pH of 7.16, indicating metabolic acidosis.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows new dependent pulmonary edema, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels indicate congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient's hypertension has been managed with metoprolol, and renal function is improving.
- The patient has ongoing issues with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and potential C. difficile colitis.
- The patient is also being treated for a knee infection caused by Candida parapsilosis and has a history of diabetes and alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a history of volume depletion, hypotension, and diarrhea, which could have led to lactic acidosis. Despite resolving acidosis, the patient continues to have hypokalemia,"

","The patient's medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, and a history of C. difficile colitis. The patient was admitted with acute renal failure (ARF), hypokalemia, hypertension, and possible infective endocarditis. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 180/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV metoprolol for hypertension and diazepam for agitation. 

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction. The patient's potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels are abnormal, suggesting metabolic acidosis. The patient also has hypocalcemia and elevated liver enzymes. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. 

The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be related to prolonged immobilization or poor nutrition. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, indicating a possible infection. 

Plan:
1. Continue to follow renal recommendations and monitor electrolytes.
2. Metabolic acidosis: Bicitra has been started to provide potassium citrate, and the patient will be monitored for improvement.
3. Hypertension: Metoprolol has been switched to IV dosing at equivalent home levels.

   Plan:
   C.Parapsilosis
 history of R knee septic arthritis, osteomyelitis.
   Now concern for endocarditis.  Increasing leukocytosis.
   -Echo yesterday showed small, new vegetation on anterior leaflet of
   mitral valve.  Not present on TEE from early [**Month (only) 93**].
   -Knee exam appears stable.
   -ID consulted
 advised continuing diflucan, but at increased dose now
   with improved renal function.  Pan-cultures sent following receipt of
   echo result, including fungal cultures.
   -continue to follow ID recs, will have low threshold for expanding
   antimicrobial coverage if fever or other signs of infection.
   -ophthalmology consult today per ID recs, in the setting of possible
   endocarditis, look for retinal emboli.
   -check LFT
   Possible UTI
 urine culture showed 10-100,000 GNR.  Started Cipro
   given overall clinical picture, leukocytosis.
   C. diff
 negative yesterday x1, no other stool.  Continue PO vanco and
   Flagyl.
   Cardiac echo findings
 echo with vegetation as above, new mild mitral
   regurg, normal function otherwise.
   -cardiac enzymes stable
 no change.  Trop 0.05, but CK-MB WNL
   -continue to monitor hemodynamics closely, daily EKG
   h/o hypoxemic respiratory failure: remains stable on 2LNC.  Reports no
   improvement with neb treatments.  CXR and exam yesterday consistent
   with volume overload, autodiuresis produced net negative fluid
   balance.  Denies SOB this am.
    -repeat CXR after PICC this morning
   - aspiration precautions.
   Hypertension:  had been hypotensive, holding antihypertensives, but
   during the day yesterday and especially during the evening pressures
   were persistently elevated, with mild tachycardia.
   -metoprolol switched to q3 IV dosing, at equivalent of previous home
   levels.
   -This morning more able to tolerate PO intake, will transition meds to
   PO as possible.
   -continue diazepam per CIWA protocol.
   -Zyprexa given x1, to provide some sedation apart from increasing benzo
   load.
   -Will add clonidine for BP control and prevention of withdrawal
   symptoms.
   -continue to monitor closely, use Ativan for signs/symptoms of
   developing withdrawal.
   ARF: Cr continues to improve from peak of 3.4 at OSH to 1.5 today, with
   brisk UOP.  Renal following.
   -etiology remains unclear.  Renal advised that RTA could be a factor,
   though cannot make the diagnosis in the setting of ARF.  Advised
   starting potassium citrate
 not on formulary, switched to Bicitra.
   -re-sent urine lytes yesterday per renal recs.
   -significant autodiuresis yesterday into overnight, with FeNa 8.8.
   Could potentially be [**2-1**] post-ATN diuresis?
   -continue to follow renal recommendations.
   -avoid nephrotoxins including NSAIDS, hold lisinopril.
   Hypokalemia: persistent, despite continued IV repletion.  Attempted PO
   repletion yesterday, but patient vomited immediately afterward.  This
   morning was able to tolerate PO potassium however.  Will plan for PICC
   today to allow for more effective repletion therapy and better access.
   Speech and swallow eval, try to improve PO nutrition.
   Metabolic Acidosis
 persistent but improving
   Other metabolic derangements:
   -hypomagnesemia

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acidosis, metabolic, possible UTI, C. diff, cardiac endocarditis, hypertension, ARF, hypokalemia, and metabolic derangements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. This can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and abnormal heart rhythm.
3. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient has persistent metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by various factors such as renal dysfunction, sepsis, or lactic acidosis. It can lead to organ dysfunction and poor tissue perfusion.
4. Possible UTI: The patient has leukocytosis and a urinary culture showing 10-100,000 GNR. This suggests a possible urinary tract infection (UTI), which can cause symptoms like fever, dysuria, and urinary frequency.
5. C. diff: The patient has been treated for C. difficile infection with vancomycin and Flagyl. C. diff infection can cause severe diarrhea and colitis."

   Renal: ARF makes it impossible to say she has RTA, will further assess
   after ARF recovers, odd that she is hypokalemia, give potassium citrate
   15cc [**Hospital1 **] as if has RTA, send repeat urine labs.
   Intermittent agitation throughout the day, with diazepam per CIWA
   protocol.  Persistently confused uncooperative, but not frankly
   agitated, tremulous, or diaphoretic.  Despite persistent restraints was
   able to pull 2 IV's during the day.  Currently has 2 peripheral IV's.
   Metoprolol dose changed to IV q3, increased to home equivalent.  HR and
   BP persistently elevated earlier during the night, improved with new
   metoprolol dosing.
   Also - echo done which showed 3 mm vegetation on anterior leaflet of
   mitral valve - this was NOT present on TEE from [**7-7**] of this year.
   Blood cultures drawn including fungal cultures.  ID consulted,
   recommended increasing fluconazole dose now that renal function

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and previous admission for septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and now concern for endocarditis. The patient presents with impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acidosis, metabolic disorder, possible UTI, C. diff infection, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been aggressive, confused, and uncooperative throughout the day. Metoprolol dose was changed to IV q3, increased to home equivalent due to persistently elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Diazepam is being given per CIWA protocol. Blood cultures were drawn, including fungal cultures. ID consulted advised increasing fluconazole dose now that renal function is improving. Ophthalmology consultation recommended for concern of retinal emboli. Renal function continues to improve from a peak of 3.4 at OSH to 1.5 today, with brisk urine output. Hypokalemia persists despite continued IV repletion, and a PICC line will be placed for more effective repletion therapy. The patient has metabolic acidosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia, which are being addressed. DM management includes lantus and insulin SS. Alcohol abuse history is noted, and CIWA scale is being used for agitation. SW consult and Valium for agitation are also planned.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, currently admitted to the ICU for severe metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure (ARF). The note highlights several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. New endocarditis: The patient has evidence of mitral valve vegetation on echocardiogram, indicating possible fungal endocarditis. The patient is already on higher-dose fluconazole and may require additional antifungal coverage. A head CT is recommended to check for embolic events.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels peaked at 3.4 and have since decreased to 1.5, suggesting improvement but ongoing renal involvement. Close monitoring and repletion of electrolytes are advised.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be related to post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis. Free water balance should be carefully checked.

4. Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: The patient presents with asymmetric pulmonary edema and left predominant infiltrate on chest X-ray, along with elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. This is concerning for decompressive heart failure, especially considering the new mitral regurgitation. The patient is autodiuresing.

5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has both anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, showing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient has a history of impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acidosis, and metabolic issues. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 177/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been receiving various medications including fluconazole, valium, and zyprexa, among others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver function tests may indicate an ongoing infection.
2. Delirium: The patient's symptoms of confusion and agitation could be indicative of delirium tremens, a severe form of alcohol withdrawal.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently high, indicating a potential risk for complications related to uncontrolled hypertension.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a negative balance, suggesting inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing fluid losses.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's history of impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of pressure ulcers or infections at pressure points.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's T"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with severe metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure. She has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has been confused and agitated, requiring higher doses of Valium and Zyprexa. She was started on higher doses of fluconazole due to evidence of mitral valve vegetation on a recent echo. The patient has impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorders, as well as acidosis. She is also experiencing diarrhea, which is suspected to be caused by Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has impaired renal function and is on dialysis. Her respiratory distress is attributed to pulmonary edema and a left predominant infiltrate on chest X-ray. There are concerns about decompressed congestive heart failure (CHF), especially with the presence of new mitral regurgitation. The patient's hypertension is managed with home agents, and she has a history of severe delirium tremens (DTs). She is being closely monitored for potential medical complications, including endocarditis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hypernatremia, hypoxemic respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and C. difficile infection."

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal. She has a history of severe metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and endocarditis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), blood pressure ranging from 177/103 to 135/62 mmHg, heart rate of 97 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals several abnormalities including a swollen right knee, poor air movement with wheezing on the left side of the chest, and tenderness in the abdomen.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, troponin-T, lactic acid, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced with high sodium, low potassium, and low magnesium levels. The urine analysis indicates a high sodium content and an osmolality of 330.

The patient's medical history includes alcohol abuse, diarrhea (possibly Clostridium difficile), hypertension, and a history of severe delirium tremens.

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of alcohol withdrawal, severe metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and impaired skin integrity. She has been diagnosed with new-onset endocarditis, specifically fungal, as evidenced by positive blood cultures. The patient is already on higher doses of fluconazole and may require micafungin. A head CT should be performed to look for any embolic events. While Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Gram-negative rods (GNR) have not been empirically covered, they are not impossible given her prolonged hospital course, including a PICC line and urinary tract infection (UTI).

Functionally, she has new mitral regurgitation and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), indicating cardiac involvement. Daily electrocardiogram (ECG) checks for intervals should be done. She is not an optimal candidate for valve replacement but may need to consult cardiovascular surgery (Csurg) in the near future for their opinion.

Regarding her renal function, her creatinine peaked at 3.4 and is now 1.5, suggesting post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis. It is important to watch and replete electrolytes. Appreciate renal involvement and check for hypernatremia in post-ATN.

The patient also presents with hypoxemic respiratory distress, asymmetrical pulmonary edema, and a left predominant infiltrate in the chest X-ray,"

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and recent C. parapsilosis right knee septic arthritis/osteomyelitis. She was admitted with delirium tremens/presumed sepsis and is now presenting with hypotension, hypoxia, and acute renal failure in the setting of recent Clostridium difficile colitis.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her condition. Some potential medical complications include:

1. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur in individuals with a history of chronic alcohol abuse. Symptoms may include agitation, confusion, hallucinations, fever, rapid heart rate, and seizures. The patient is already experiencing delirium tremens, and treatment with benzodiazepines such as diazepam is recommended.

2. Septic arthritis/osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of C. parapsilosis infection in her right knee joint, which has progressed to osteomyelitis. This condition can lead to further spread of infection and potentially involve other organs, including the heart. Antibiotics are necessary for treatment, and surgical intervention may be required.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is characterized by a sudden loss of kidney function. This can result in the accumulation of waste products and toxins in the body. The underlying cause of renal failure needs to"

   good effect.
    stable on 2LNC.  Reports no improvement with neb treatments.  CXR and
   exam yesterday consistent with volume overload, autodiuresis produced
   net negative fluid balance.  Denies SOB this am.
   -repeat CXR after PICC this morning.
   - aspiration precautions.
   Hypertension:  had been hypotensive, holding antihypertensives, but
   during the day yesterday and especially during the evening pressures
   were persistently elevated, with mild tachycardia.
   -metoprolol switched to q3 IV dosing, at equivalent of previous home
   levels.
   -This morning more able to tolerate PO intake, will transition meds to
   PO as possible.
   -continue diazepam per CIWA protocol.
   -Zyprexa given x1, to provide some sedation apart from increasing benzo
   load.
   -Will add clonidine for BP control and prevention of withdrawal
   symptoms.
   -continue to monitor closely, use Ativan for signs/symptoms of
   developing withdrawal.
   ARF: Cr continues to improve from peak of 3.4 at OSH to 1.5 today, with
   brisk UOP.  Renal following.
   -etiology remains unclear.  Renal advised that RTA could be a factor,
   though cannot make the diagnosis in the setting of ARF.  Advised
   starting potassium citrate
 not on formulary, switched to Bicitra.
   -re-sent urine lytes yesterday per renal recs.
   -significant autodiuresis yesterday into overnight, with FeNa 8.8.
   Could potentially be [**2-1**] post-ATN diuresis?
   -continue to follow renal recommendations.
   -avoid nephrotoxins including NSAIDS, hold lisinopril.
   Hypokalemia: persistent, despite continued IV repletion.  Attempted PO
   repletion yesterday, but patient vomited immediately afterward.  This
   morning was able to tolerate PO potassium however.  Will plan for PICC
   today to allow for more effective repletion therapy and better access.

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes, alcohol abuse, and C. parapsilosis R knee septic arthritis/osteomyelitis. She was recently admitted with delirium tremens/PRES and is now presenting with hypotension, hypoxia, and acute renal failure in the setting of recent C. diff colitis. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypertension, impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorders, acidosis, and possible endocarditis with vegetation on the mitral valve. She also has a history of alcohol withdrawal and is currently on a benzodiazepine protocol for withdrawal symptoms. The patient's renal function is improving, but the etiology of acute renal failure remains unclear. She has hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which are being repleted. The patient's metabolic derangements include hypocalcemia, which is improving, and there is a suspicion of hypoparathyroidism. She has a history of diabetes and is on lantus and insulin SS for glycemic control. The patient requires ongoing ICU care with attention to nutrition, glycemic control, and electrolyte repletion. She is on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP, and her code status is full code."

   Imaging: CXR: [**2190-8-20**] Since the previous study, there has been a
   worsening of the multifocal
   pulmonary opacities particularly in the right mid and upper lung which
   are
   more dense and confluent. In the left lung, there may be an area of
   cavitation in the mid lung consolidation and new opacities in the left
   lower
   lung. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No pneumothorax.
   IMPRESSION:
   The PICC line should be withdrawn 4-5 cm to optimal positioning.
   Worsening of
   the multifocal consolidation with possible cavitation of a left
   airspace
   opacity. Attention to this area should be made on followup.

   h/o hypoxemic respiratory failure: remains stable on 2LNC.  Reports no
   improvement with neb treatments.  CXR and exam yesterday consistent
   with volume overload, autodiuresis produced net negative fluid
   balance.  Denies SOB this am.
    -repeat CXR after PICC this morning
   - aspiration precautions.
   Hypertension:  had been hypotensive, holding antihypertensives, but
   during the day yesterday and especially during the evening pressures
   were persistently elevated, with mild tachycardia.
   -metoprolol switched to q3 IV dosing, at equivalent of previous home
   levels.
   -This morning more able to tolerate PO intake, will transition meds to
   PO as possible.
   -continue diazepam per CIWA protocol.
   -Zyprexa given x1, to provide some sedation apart from increasing benzo
   load.
   -Will add clonidine for BP control and prevention of withdrawal
   symptoms.
   -continue to monitor closely, use Ativan for signs/symptoms of
   developing withdrawal.
   ARF: Cr continues to improve from peak of 3.4 at OSH to 1.5 today, with
   brisk UOP.  Renal following.
   -etiology remains unclear.  Renal advised that RTA could be a factor,
   though cannot make the diagnosis in the setting of ARF.  Advised
   starting potassium citrate
 not on formulary, switched to Bicitra.
   -re-sent urine lytes yesterday per renal recs.
   -significant autodiuresis yesterday into overnight, with FeNa 8.8.
   Could potentially be [**2-1**] post-ATN diuresis?
   -continue to follow renal recommendations.
   -avoid nephrotoxins including NSAIDS, hold lisinopril.
   Hypokalemia: persistent, despite continued IV repletion.  Attempted PO
   repletion yesterday, but patient vomited immediately afterward.  This
   morning was able to tolerate PO potassium however.  Will plan for PICC
   today to allow for more effective repletion therapy and better access.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and recent admission for delirium tremens/presumed septic arthritis/osteomyelitis caused by Candida parapsilosis. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including hypotension, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has a history of recent Clostridium difficile colitis and is now presenting with worsening heart failure and possible endocarditis. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, hypertension, and a possible urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there are concerns about maintaining adequate perfusion.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen saturation levels, indicating potential respiratory distress.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. The etiology of ARF is unclear, but it may be related to rhabdomyolysis or nephrotoxic medications.
4. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has significant electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia. These imbalances require careful monitoring and correction.
5. Possible Endocarditis: The patient's cardiac echo shows new vegetation on the mitral valve, suggesting the possibility of endocarditis"

   Plan:
   R knee C.Parapsilosis osteomyelitis started diflucan on [**6-16**] but
   noncompliant. Now concern for endocarditis with TTE showing question of
   vegetation. Per ID,retap joint to determine whether septic, if septic,
   will require prolonged course abx, if not septic, to continue diflucan
   until seen as o/p with further recommendations at that time.
   -Echo yesterday showed small, new vegetation on anterior leaflet of
   mitral valve.  Not present on TEE from early [**Month (only) 93**].
   Consider repeat TEE. Follow up with cards. No new murmur, no [**Doctor Last Name **]
   spots/ findings suggestive of embolic disease seen by optho consult.
   -Knee exam appears stable.
   -ID consulted
 advised continuing diflucan, but at increased dose now
   with improved renal function.  Pan-cultures sent following receipt of
   echo result, including fungal cultures.
   -continue to follow ID recs, will have low threshold for expanding
   antimicrobial coverage if fever or other signs of infection.
   -ophthalmology consult today per ID recs, in the setting of possible
   endocarditis, look for retinal emboli.
   -check LFT

   h/o hypoxemic respiratory failure: remains stable on 2LNC.  Reports no
   improvement with neb treatments.  CXR and exam yesterday consistent
   with volume overload, autodiuresis produced net negative fluid
   balance.  Denies SOB this am.
    -repeat CXR after PICC this morning
   - aspiration precautions.
   Hypertension:  had been hypotensive, holding antihypertensives, but
   during the day yesterday and especially during the evening pressures
   were persistently elevated, with mild tachycardia.
   -metoprolol switched to q3 IV dosing, at equivalent of previous home
   levels.
   -This morning more able to tolerate PO intake, will transition meds to
   PO as possible.
   -continue diazepam per CIWA protocol.
   -Zyprexa given x1, to provide some sedation apart from increasing benzo
   load.
   -Will add clonidine for BP control and prevention of withdrawal
   symptoms.
   -continue to monitor closely, use Ativan for signs/symptoms of
   developing withdrawal.
   ARF: Cr continues to improve from peak of 3.4 at OSH to 1.5 today, with
   brisk UOP.  Renal following.
   -etiology remains unclear.  Renal advised that RTA could be a factor,
   though cannot make the diagnosis in the setting of ARF.  Advised
   starting potassium citrate
 not on formulary, switched to Bicitra.
   -re-sent urine lytes yesterday per renal recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of diabetes, EtOH abuse, and C. parapsilosis R knee septic arthritis/osteomyelitis. She was recently admitted with delirium tremens/PRES and is now presenting with hypotension, hypoxia, and acute renal failure in the setting of recent C. diff colitis. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypertension, impaired skin integrity, alcohol withdrawal, electrolyte and fluid disorder, metabolic acidosis, and possible endocarditis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening of septic arthritis/osteomyelitis due to C. parapsilosis infection.
2. Development of endocarditis, considering the presence of new vegetation on the mitral valve.
3. Progression of acute renal failure and further deterioration of renal function.
4. Complications related to C. diff colitis such as pseudomembranous colitis or toxic megacolon.
5. Hypotension and hypoxia may indicate septic shock or respiratory distress.
6. Impaired skin integrity can lead to infections or pressure ulcers.
7. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms may require close monitoring and treatment.
8. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, need to be addressed to prevent cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
9. Metabolic acidosis requires ongoing monitoring and treatment.
10. Potential complications associated with long-term anticoagulant"

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and recent knee septic arthritis/osteomyelitis. She was admitted with delirium tremens and PRES (presumably referring to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). The patient is currently presenting with hypotension, hypoxia, and acute renal failure in the setting of recent Clostridium difficile colitis.

24-hour events:
- PICC line started on 08/20/2190 at 09:55 AM.
- Cultures for OSH were taken on 08/17 and 08/18.
- The patient's rehab records showed a positive test for Clostridium difficile on 07/28/2190.
- The patient experienced increased work of breathing and oxygen requirements, leading to a theory of worsening heart failure. An echo was done, showing minimal mitral regurgitation and no vegetation. The patient's sodium levels were initially high but then became hyponatremic and hypokalemic. She received 40mEq of normal saline and later 40mEq of potassium in D5W.
- Renal issues may be related to fluconazole use. Daily electrolyte monitoring was ordered, along with a SPEP (serum protein electrophoresis), UPEP (urine protein electrophoresis), renal ultrasound, and other tests.

   septic, will require prolonged course abx, if not septic, to continue
   diflucan until seen as o/p with further recommendations at that time.
   -Echo yesterday showed small, new vegetation on anterior leaflet of
   mitral valve.  Not present on TEE from early [**Month (only) 93**].
   Consider repeat TEE. Follow up with cards. No new murmur, no [**Doctor Last Name **]
   spots/ findings suggestive of embolic disease seen by optho consult.
   -Knee exam appears stable. Ortho to retap. As renal function increased
   over MICU stay, ID advised increasing diflucan dose. Pan cultures sent

    -repeat CXR after PICC this morning
   - aspiration precautions.
   Hypertension:  had been hypotensive, holding antihypertensives, but
   during the day yesterday and especially during the evening pressures
   were persistently elevated, with mild tachycardia.
   -metoprolol switched to q3 IV dosing, at equivalent of previous home
   levels.
   -This morning more able to tolerate PO intake, will transition meds to
   PO as possible.
   -continue diazepam per CIWA protocol.
   -Zyprexa given x1, to provide some sedation apart from increasing benzo

   developing withdrawal.
   ARF: Cr continues to improve from peak of 3.4 at OSH to 1.5 today, with
   brisk UOP.  Renal following.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), ethanol abuse, and Candida parapsilosis right knee septic arthritis/osteomyelitis. She was recently admitted with delirium tremens and presents with hypotension, hypoxia, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is variable, ranging from 107/50 to 140/90 mmHg. This could indicate issues with blood flow and perfusion to vital organs.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are low, ranging from 89-94%. This suggests inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues, which can lead to tissue damage.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances and toxicity due to the accumulation of waste products.
4. Delirium Tremens: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal and is currently experiencing agitation and confusion. Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
5. Candida parapsilosis Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection caused by Candida parapsilosis in her right knee. This infection has led to se"

   Plan:
   R knee C.Parapsilosis osteomyelitis started diflucan on [**6-16**] but
   noncompliant. Now concern for endocarditis with TTE showing question of
   vegetation. Per ID,retap joint to determine whether septic, if septic,
   will require prolonged course abx, if not septic, to continue diflucan
   until seen as o/p with further recommendations at that time.
   -Echo yesterday showed small, new vegetation on anterior leaflet of
   mitral valve.  Not present on TEE from early [**Month (only) 93**].
   Consider repeat TEE. Follow up with cards. No new murmur, no [**Doctor Last Name **]
   spots/ findings suggestive of embolic disease seen by optho consult.
   -Knee exam appears stable.
   -ID consulted
 advised continuing diflucan, but at increased dose now
   with improved renal function.  Pan-cultures sent following receipt of
   echo result, including fungal cultures.
   -continue to follow ID recs, will have low threshold for expanding
   antimicrobial coverage if fever or other signs of infection.
   -ophthalmology consult today per ID recs, in the setting of possible
   endocarditis, look for retinal emboli.
   -check LFT
   Possible UTI
 urine culture showed 10-100,000 GNR.  Started Cipro
   given overall clinical picture, leukocytosis.
   C. diff
 negative yesterday x1, no other stool.  Continue PO vanco and
   Flagyl.
   Cardiac echo findings
 echo with vegetation as above, new mild mitral
   regurg, normal function otherwise.
   -cardiac enzymes stable
 no change.  Trop 0.05, but CK-MB WNL
   -continue to monitor hemodynamics closely, daily EKG
   h/o hypoxemic respiratory failure: remains stable on 2LNC.  Reports no
   improvement with neb treatments.  CXR and exam yesterday consistent
   with volume overload, autodiuresis produced net negative fluid
   balance.  Denies SOB this am.
    -repeat CXR after PICC this morning
   - aspiration precautions.
   Hypertension:  had been hypotensive, holding antihypertensives, but
   during the day yesterday and especially during the evening pressures
   were persistently elevated, with mild tachycardia.
   -metoprolol switched to q3 IV dosing, at equivalent of previous home
   levels.
   -This morning more able to tolerate PO intake, will transition meds to
   PO as possible.
   -continue diazepam per CIWA protocol.
   -Zyprexa given x1, to provide some sedation apart from increasing benzo
   load.
   -Will add clonidine for BP control and prevention of withdrawal
   symptoms.
   -continue to monitor closely, use Ativan for signs/symptoms of
   developing withdrawal.
   ARF: Cr continues to improve from peak of 3.4 at OSH to 1.5 today, with
   brisk UOP.  Renal following.
   -etiology remains unclear.  Renal advised that RTA could be a factor,
   though cannot make the diagnosis in the setting of ARF.  Advised
   starting potassium citrate
 not on formulary, switched to Bicitra.
   -re-sent urine lytes yesterday per renal recs.
   -significant autodiuresis yesterday into overnight, with FeNa 8.8.
   Could potentially be [**2-1**] post-ATN diuresis?
   -continue to follow renal recommendations.
   -avoid nephrotoxins including NSAIDS, hold lisinopril.
   Hypokalemia: persistent, despite continued IV repletion.  Attempted PO
   repletion yesterday, but patient vomited immediately afterward.  This
   morning was able to tolerate PO potassium however.  Will plan for PICC
   today to allow for more effective repletion therapy and better access.

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes, ethanol abuse, and C. parapsilosis R knee septic arthritis/osteomyelitis. She was recently admitted with delirium tremens/PRES and is now presenting with hypotension, hypoxia, and acute renal failure in the setting of recent C. diff colitis.

24-hour events include the start of a PICC line, OSH cultures, rehab records faxed showing C diff positive on [2190-7-28], increased work of breathing and oxygen requirements, and an ECHO with cardiology showing minimal MR, not the cause of heart failure.

The patient has multiple wounds on her arms and legs, which were covered with mepilex for protection. Her blood pressure was initially elevated but fell overnight to 107/120. She was placed on metoprolol 37.6 PO and clonidine 0.2 mg. Her oxygen saturation dropped overnight to 89-90% and she was put back on a face tent with 40% FiO2 and 10 L NC.

Electrolyte imbalances were treated, and her blood pressure was stabilized with the addition of trazedone. The patient's impaired skin integrity was assessed, and she was given barrier cream to extremities and mepilex for breakdown. Electrolyte and fluid disorders were also addressed.

Allergies include hives and itching with cefaz"

   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to pulmonary edema, perhaps
   cardiogenic or non-cardiogneic (i.e. ARDS). Wheezes may be cardiac
   wheezes or reactive airways disease (former smoker).   Monitor RR,
   SaO2, CXR.  Treat with diuretics.  Would use b-agonist and atrovent,
   consider brief course steroids (inhaled or parenteral).
   ENDOVASCULAR INFECTION(?) --  concern for small vegetation by echo (?
   fungal).  Consider TEE.  Monitor blood cultures.  ID consultation in
   progress.
   RIGHT KNEE ARTHRITIS --  Candidal osteomyelitis, persistent.  Check
   blood cx, continue Fluconazole.  If evidence for endovascular
   infection, may need to consider definitive treatment of right knee
   infection.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Creatinine peaked at 3.4 --> now improved to
   1.5, attributed to ATN.  Now with post-ATN diuresis --> monitor and
   replete lytes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with severe metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure. She is experiencing respiratory distress attributed to pulmonary edema, possibly cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic (ARDS). There are concerns about an endovascular infection, with possible small vegetation seen on cardiac echo (fungal). The patient also has right knee arthritis due to candidal osteomyelitis and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with subsequent post-ATN diuresis. She has hypernatremia, mixed metabolic acidosis, non-diabetic hyperglycemia, and Clostridium difficile diarrhea. The patient is also hypertensive, has a history of alcohol use, and requires nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema may lead to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Endovascular Infection: The concern for small vegetation suggests the possibility of an endovascular infection, which could progress and cause septic emboli or spread to other parts of the body.
3. Right Knee Infection: The persistent candidal osteomyelitis in the right knee may require definitive treatment if there is evidence of an endovascular infection.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's previous acute tubular necrosis and current post-ATN diuresis indicate a risk of recurrent or worsening kidney injury.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yr old woman transferred from OSH with severe metabolic acidosis and
   ARF
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to pulmonary edema, perhaps
   cardiogenic or non-cardiogneic (i.e. ARDS). Wheezes may be cardiac
   wheezes or reactive airways disease (former smoker).   Monitor RR,
   SaO2, CXR.  Treat with diuretics.  Would use b-agonist and atrovent,
   consider brief course steroids (inhaled or parenteral).
   ENDOVASCULAR INFECTION(?) --  concern for small vegetation by echo (?
   fungal).  Consider TEE.  Monitor blood cultures.  ID consultation in
   progress.
   RIGHT KNEE ARTHRITIS --  Candidal osteomyelitis, persistent.  Check
   blood cx, continue Fluconazole.  If evidence for endovascular
   infection, may need to consider definitive treatment of right knee
   infection.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Creatinine peaked at 3.4 --> now improved to
   1.5, attributed to ATN.  Now with post-ATN diuresis --> monitor and
   replete lytes.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- attributed to post ATN --> replete free water, monitor
   Na
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS -- mixed anion gap and non anion gap
 slowly
   improving
   NIDDM -- moonitor glucose, maintain <150
   DIARRHEA -- + C diff from outside facility
 will repeat toxin,
   maintain Flagyl/Vanco
   HTN -- maintain home agents
   EtOH -- monitor  for withdrawal, CIWA
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- encourage suppliments
   Remaining plans as per Housestaff

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with severe metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure. She has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic ethanol abuse. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress attributed to pulmonary edema, possibly cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic (ARDS). Wheezes may be cardiac wheezes or reactive airways disease due to her history as a former smoker. The patient has an endovascular infection with concern for small vegetation on cardiac echo, possibly fungal. There is also a right knee arthritis caused by candidal osteomyelitis, which has been persistent. The patient's renal function has improved from a peak creatinine level of 3.4 to 1.5, likely due to acute tubular necrosis. She is experiencing post-ATN diuresis and requires monitoring and repletion of electrolytes. The patient has hypernatremia attributed to post-ATN and requires repletion of free water and monitoring of sodium levels. She also has mixed anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is slowly improving. The patient has a history of diabetes and is at risk for complications related to it, such as infections and poor glycemic control. She has diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile from an outside facility, and her blood cultures are being monitored. The patient's blood pressure needs to be managed with home agents. There is a concern for ethanol withdrawal,"
