","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of multiple pelvic/hip fractures due to a fall. She has a history of recent admission for diarrhea/dehydration, complicated by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). She was discharged to rehab but fell again, resulting in fractures of the left pubic bone, right sacral, and hip. The patient is currently in the ICU with various medical complications, including hypertension, DVT, PE, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), dementia, osteoporosis, aortic insufficiency, and no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate 78 bpm (70-97 bpm), blood pressure 129/103 mmHg (108/51-157/108 mmHg), respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute (6-21 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation 99%, and sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 338 mL, with outputs of 60 mL PO, 110 mL TF, 118 mL IVF, 160 mL blood products, and 228 mL drain balance.

The physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, 2+ edema in both extremities, and the patient is attentive and oriented. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's condition.

Lab results show elevated PT/PTT/IN"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill 86-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is a fall resulting in pelvic/hip fractures. The patient has a history of diarrhea, dehydration, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), hypertension, dementia, osteoporosis, and aortic insufficiency. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/103 mmHg to 157/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she is receiving respiratory support with a non-rebreather mask.

Physical examination reveals bilateral lower extremity edema and clear breath sounds in the chest. Neurological assessment is not complete due to the patient's inability to respond adequately. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of PT, PTT, and INR, indicating a coagulopathy. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, suggesting no acute myocardial infarction. Imaging studies, including a head CT, chest x-ray, and CT c-spine, do not reveal any significant findings except for a small left pleural effusion.

The assessment and plan include management of hip fracture, anemia, hypoxemia, and PE. The patient is being"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with HTN, osteoporosis, recent DVT/PE (diagnosed 6 days ago),
   admit with multiple fractures following fall at rehab with increased
   oxygen requirement.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient has known recent acute PE, discharged on 2 L NC.  Reason for
   acute worsening unclear - differential includes worsening pulmonary
   clot burden (thrombotic or fat embolus; IVC filter in place and
   therapeutic on heparin); volume overload (possible given clinical
   appearance); infection (no pneumonia on current film), ACS (mild
   elevation in troponins overnight), hypoventilation from pain or
   narcotics. Despite troponin elevation to 0.20, ACS likely not sole
   cause of hypoxia. Patient with RR to 8 or less with narcotics
   overnight.
   - Consider dose of furosemide this AM to attempt to reduce dependence
   on supplemental oxygen
   - NC as needed for oxygnenation
   - Minimize narcotics if at all possible.
   - ABG prn, may have respiratory acidosis as well if hypoventilating.
   - Consideration on intubation pre-op if worsening (patient DNR/DNI in
   past, but family okay with intubation if respiratory decompensation
   prior to OR).
   - Anticoagulate again post-op as soon as allowable
   #  R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior
   pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures:
   Ortho following and planning to take to OR today. Heparin drip has been
   on hold. Is receiving FFP prior to surgery. Had two units of PRBC as
   requested by orthopedic surgery yesterday. Pain consult service will
   help to manage with epidural catheter.
   - Surgery today
   - Pain control with prn IV morphine and standing tylenol.
   - Monitor for delerium post op (high risk)
   - Restart anticoagulation at therapeutic dosing post op when possible.
   # Recent PE:
   Anticoagulation has been stopped overnight in anticipation of surgery.
   - Restart heparin as soon as orthopaedics comfortable
   - Consideration for intubation preop if needed.
   - Consideration for delayed extubation post op if respiratory status
   tenuous.
   # Diarrhea:
   Recent admission for diarrhea/dehydration.  ?IBD related with good
   response to oral steroids.  Has been on 60 mg prednisone since [**5-21**]
   (four days). This was stopped in peri-operative setting.
   - Opium ticture, bismuth, loperamide
   - Eventual outpatient colonoscopy as per plans at last discharge.
   # ECG changes.
   Anterior TWI new since last ECG, but had had similar changes prior.
   Troponin initially 0.09; however, has climbed up to 0.20 this AM.
   - Continue beta blockers peri-operatively.
   # Anemia:
   Current HCT is stable at 30; however, at risk for acute blood loss
   anemia with fractures and therapeutic on heparin.
   - Post-op serial HCTs today
   # Leukocytosis:
   Acute stress from fracture, steroid usage, vs. infection.  UA negative,
   CXR without infiltrate.
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Consider blood cx.
   - Repeat in AM.
   # Hypertension:
   BPs in 100-160s here and has been stable
   # Hypothryoidism
   - Continue home dose.
   # Osteoporosis:
   Intolerant of bisphos in past.  Continue vitamin D and calcium.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin levels, as well as prolonged prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has known recent acute PE, and the acute worsening of hypoxia may be due to worsening pulmonary clot burden, volume overload, infection, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or hypoventilation from pain or narcotics. The patient's troponin elevation suggests ACS, but it is not the sole cause of hypoxia. Consideration should be given to reducing dependence on supplemental oxygen, minimizing narcotics, and performing an arterial blood gas (ABG) to assess for respiratory acidosis.

2. Fractures: The patient has multiple fractures, including a right femoral intratro"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with HTN, osteoporosis, recent DVT/PE (diagnosed 6 days ago),
   admit with multiple fractures following fall at rehab with increased
   oxygen requirement.
   #  Hypoxia:  Patient has known recent acute PE, discharged on 2 L NC.
   Reason for acute worsening unclear - differential includes worsening
   pulmonary clot burden (thrombotic or fat embolus; IVC filter in place
   and therapeutic on heparin); volume overload (not supported by CXR;
   infection (no pneumonia on current film), ACS (mild elevation in
   troponins, though stable), hypoventilation from pain or narcotics.
   - Cycle enzymes and serial ECGs.
   - NRB vs. NC support.
   - Minimize narcotics if at all possible.
   - ABG prn, may have respiratory acidosis as well if hypoventilating.
   - Consideration on intubation pre-op if worsening (patient DNR/DNI in
   past, but family okay with intubation if respiratory decompensation
   prior to OR).
   - Continue heparin gtt until MN, then stop.  Restart post-op with
   eventual restart of coumadin as well.
   - Transfuse pRBCs now, may need lasix in between units.
   #  R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior
   pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures.  Ortho following and
   planning to take to OR tomorrow.
   - Pain control with prn IV morphine and standing tylenol.
   - Scheduled for OR tomorrow.
   - Will hold heparin gtt after MN
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need FFP tomorrow AM prior to surgery.
   - [**Doctor First Name **] requesting 2 units of PRBCs now
   - [**Doctor First Name **] requesting lateral films of hip (when pain control improved).
   - Monitor for delerium post op (high risk)
   - Restart anticoagulation at therapeutic dosing post op when possible.
   - Monitor HCT serially throughout day (next following units of pRBCs).
   - Will discuss epidural catheter today with acute pain service.
   - Preoperative risk assessment:  Patient has no current major
   predictors of perioperative cardiovascular risk (no MI though has had
   troponin elevation in setting of acute PE; no decompensated heart
   failure, malignant arrhythmia, or severe valvular disease).  However,
   does need repeat ECG and troponins for trending to ensure not having
   acute MI.  Patient does have clinical factors that put her at increased
   surgical risk.  By the revised [**Doctor Last Name **] cardiac risk index, patient has
   two predictors of major cardiac complications - history of heart
   failure and history of cerebrovascular disease.  The estimated rate of
   cardiac death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal cardiac arrest is therefore
   2.4%, which can be decreased to <2% with perioperative beta blockade.
   Of note, this does not take into consideration her recent PE (will be
   anticoagulated x 7 days at the time of surgery) and somewhat limited
   pulmonary reserve.  Further cardiac evaluation (stress testing, cardiac
   cath) is unlikely to alter management and thus should not be futher
   pursued.
   # Recent PE.  Now on day 6 of anticoagulation.
   - Continue heparin until MN, stop for surgery, then likely restart
   following
   - Consideration for intubation preop if needed.
   - Consideration for delayed extubation post op if respiratory status
   tenuous.
   # Diarrhea.  Recent admission for diarrhea/dehydration.  ?IBD related
   with good response to oral steroids.  Has been on 60 mg prednisone
   since [**5-21**] (four days).
   - Hold steroids now with acute fracture and need for OR; only on x 4
   days so should not need gradual taper.
   - Consideration of systemic steroids or nonabsorbed PO steroid regimen
   if diarrhea worsens.
   - Opium ticture, bismuth, loperamide okay.
   - Eventual outpatient colonoscopy as per plans at last discharge.
   # ECG changes.  Anterior TWI new since last ECG, but had had similar
   changes prior. Troponin 0.09, same as past value.
   - Cycle enzymes and serial ECG.
   - Trial of beta blocker last this evening.
   # Anemia.  Current Hct similar to discharge; however, at risk for acute
   blood loss anemia with fractures and therapeutic on heparin.
   - 2 units now.
   - serial hct throughout day.
   # Leukocytosis.  Acute stress from fracture, steroid usage, vs.
   infection.  UA negative, CXR without infiltrate.
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Consider blood cx.
   - Repeat in AM.
   # Hypertension.  BPs in 100-110s here.  Concern for potential to have
   acute blood loss with fractures and heparin.
   - Hold antiHTNs for now.  Start BB.
   # Hypothryoidism.  Continue home dose.
   # Osteoporosis.  Intolerant of bisphos in past.  Continue vitamin D and
   calcium.

   Disposition:  Patient is DNR/DNI; however, will be reversed for OR.  In
   addition, if patient has respiratory deterioration prior to OR, family
   is okay with intubation prior to surgery.  Following OR, will likely be
   DNR/DNI again.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). She was admitted to the ICU with multiple fractures after falling at a rehabilitation center and increased oxygen requirement.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has known recent acute PE and is on 2 L nasal cannula oxygen. The reason for acute worsening is unclear, but possible causes include worsening pulmonary clot burden, volume overload, infection, or hypoventilation from pain or narcotics.

2. R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures: The patient is scheduled for surgery tomorrow. Pain control measures include IV morphine and standing Tylenol. She will hold heparin gtt after midnight and receive FFP prior to surgery. Ortho is following and planning to take her to the OR tomorrow.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is similar to discharge, but she is at risk for acute blood loss anemia with fractures and therapeutic on heparin. Two units of PRBCs are requested now, and serial Hct should be monitored throughout the day.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated WBC count, which could be due to acute stress from fracture, steroid usage, or infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis and recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. She was admitted after a fall and subsequent fractures to her right hip, pelvic, and sacral areas. The patient has been experiencing pain control issues due to respiratory depression, and she is also anxious. Her refractory hypoxemia required admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU), but her oxygenation has improved.

24-hour events include starting midline access, nasal swab for MRSA screening, and an EKG. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received various medications including heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, levoxyl, omeprazole, vit D, paxil, lopressor, opium tincture, and LR boluses.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 77 bpm (49-97 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 173/76 mmHg to 98/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute (6-22 bpm), and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has received respiratory support through a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, PERRL eyes, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, warm skin,"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis and recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). She was admitted after falling and fracturing her right hip, pelvic, and sacral bones. The patient has been experiencing pain control issues due to respiratory depression and is very anxious. She required transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for refractory hypoxemia. Her hypoxemia has improved.

24-hour events include the placement of a midline, nasal swab for MRSA screening, and an EKG. The patient has no known drug allergies. She received infusions of heparin sodium and morphine sulfate.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 173/76 mmHg to 100/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the addition of hypoxemia.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.20.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, and normal findings in various body systems. The"

   86 yo F with HTN, osteoporosis, recent DVT/PE (diagnosed 6 days ago),
   admit with multiple fractures following fall at rehab with increased
   oxygen requirement.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient has known recent acute PE, discharged on 2 L NC.  Reason for
   acute worsening unclear - differential includes worsening pulmonary
   clot burden (thrombotic or fat embolus; IVC filter in place and
   therapeutic on heparin); volume overload (possible given clinical
   appearance); infection (no pneumonia on current film), ACS (mild
   elevation in troponins following admission, but now stable),
   hypoventilation from pain or narcotics. Despite troponin elevation to
   0.20, ACS likely not sole cause of hypoxia. Patient with RR to 8 or
   less with narcotics.
   - Consider ongoing furosemide to attempt to reduce dependence on
   supplemental oxygen
   - NC as needed for oxygenation
   - Minimize narcotics if at all possible
   - ABG prn, may have respiratory acidosis as well if hypoventilating
   - Consideration on intubation pre-op if worsening (patient DNR/DNI in
   past, but family okay with intubation if respiratory decompensation
   prior to OR).
   - Heparin anticoagulation
   #  R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior
   pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures:
   Ortho following and planning to take to OR today. Heparin drip has been
   on hold. Is receiving FFP prior to surgery. Had two units of PRBC as
   requested by orthopedic surgery yesterday. Pain consult service will
   help to manage with epidural catheter.
   - Surgery today
   - Pain control with prn IV morphine and standing tylenol
   - Monitor for delerium post op (high risk)
   - Restart anticoagulation at therapeutic dosing post op when possible.
   # Anemia:
   Current HCT had appropriate rise from 23.3 to 27.3 following one unit
   PRBC transfusion this AM.
   - Every six hour HCTs today
   # Recent PE:
   Patient has large L common femoral vein DVT had IVC filter placed on
   [**2132-5-22**] and was anti-coagulated following. Anticoagulation has been
   restarted.
   - Continue heparin drip for now and consider restarting warfarin if HCT
   stable in next day.
   # Diarrhea:
   Recent admission for diarrhea/dehydration. ?IBD related with good
   response to oral steroids.  Has been on 60 mg prednisone since [**5-21**]
   (four days). This was stopped in peri-operative setting. Currently has
   no diarrhea. Some concern that patient hasn
t had BM recently in
   setting of systemic opiates.
   - Discontinue opium tincture
   - Continue bismuth, loperamide
   - Eventual outpatient colonoscopy as per plans at last discharge.
   # ECG changes.
   Anterior TWI new since last ECG, but had had similar changes prior.
   Troponin initially 0.09; however, climbed up to 0.20 day after
   admission. Remained stable.
   - Continue to monitor via telemetry
   # Leukocytosis:
   Has been afebrile. Acute stress from fracture, steroid usage, vs.
   infection.  UA negative, CXR without infiltrate.
   - Continue to trend

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). She was admitted with multiple fractures following a fall at a rehabilitation facility and increased oxygen requirement. She has been treated with heparin for anticoagulation, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. The patient underwent orthopedic surgery to address her fractures and received blood transfusions due to anemia. She has been experiencing pain, and pain management has been a focus. The patient also had diarrhea/dehydration prior to admission, which responded well to oral steroids. There have been concerns about her bowel movements while on systemic opiates. The patient has shown ECG changes, with troponin elevations but stable levels. She has leukocytosis without signs of infection. Her blood pressure has been stable, and she has been on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She has a history of osteoporosis and intolerance to bisphosphonates. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving ongoing care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and there are several possible causes, including worsening pulmonary clot burden, volume overload, infection, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and hypoventilation due to pain or narcotics. Monitoring and management strategies include minimizing narcotics, considering ongoing f"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted with multiple fractures after falling at a rehabilitation center and required increased oxygen. The patient's oxygen requirement worsened, leading to differential diagnoses including worsening pulmonary clot burden, volume overload, infection, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), hypoventilation from pain or narcotics, and others. The patient's troponin levels are mildly elevated, indicating possible ACS but not solely responsible for the hypoxia. The patient has been on a heparin drip, which was temporarily stopped overnight before surgery.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: Consider reducing dependence on supplemental oxygen, using NC as needed, minimizing narcotics, ABG prn, and intubation pre-op if worsening.
2. R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures: Ortho following and planning to take to OR today. Heparin drip has been on hold. Receiving FFP prior to surgery. Pain consult service will help manage with epidural catheter.
3. Recent PE: Anticoagulation has been stopped overnight in anticipation of surgery. Restart heparin as soon as orthopedics comfortable, consideration for intubation preop if needed, and delayed extubation post op if respiratory status tenuous.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with HTN, osteoporosis, recent DVT/PE (diagnosed 6 days ago),
   admit with multiple fractures following fall at rehab with increased
   oxygen requirement.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient has known recent acute PE, discharged on 2 L NC.  Reason for
   acute worsening unclear - differential includes worsening pulmonary
   clot burden (thrombotic or fat embolus; IVC filter in place and
   therapeutic on heparin); volume overload (possible given clinical
   appearance); infection (no pneumonia on current film), ACS (mild
   elevation in troponins overnight), hypoventilation from pain or
   narcotics. Despite troponin elevation to 0.20, ACS likely not sole
   cause of hypoxia. Patient with RR to 8 or less with narcotics
   overnight.
   - Consider dose of furosemide this AM to attempt to reduce dependence
   on supplemental oxygen
   - NC as needed for oxygnenation
   - Minimize narcotics if at all possible.
   - ABG prn, may have respiratory acidosis as well if hypoventilating.
   - Consideration on intubation pre-op if worsening (patient DNR/DNI in
   past, but family okay with intubation if respiratory decompensation
   prior to OR).
   - Anticoagulate again post-op as soon as allowable
   #  R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior
   pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures:
   Ortho following and planning to take to OR today. Heparin drip has been
   on hold. Is receiving FFP prior to surgery. Had two units of PRBC as
   requested by orthopedic surgery yesterday. Pain consult service will
   help to manage with epidural catheter.
   - Surgery today
   - Pain control with prn IV morphine and standing tylenol.
   - Monitor for delerium post op (high risk)
   - Restart anticoagulation at therapeutic dosing post op when possible.
   # Recent PE:
   Anticoagulation has been stopped overnight in anticipation of surgery.
   - Restart heparin as soon as orthopaedics comfortable
   - Consideration for intubation preop if needed.
   - Consideration for delayed extubation post op if respiratory status
   tenuous.
   # Diarrhea:
   Recent admission for diarrhea/dehydration.  ?IBD related with good
   response to oral steroids.  Has been on 60 mg prednisone since [**5-21**]
   (four days). This was stopped in peri-operative setting.
   - Opium ticture, bismuth, loperamide
   - Eventual outpatient colonoscopy as per plans at last discharge.
   # ECG changes.
   Anterior TWI new since last ECG, but had had similar changes prior.
   Troponin initially 0.09; however, has climbed up to 0.20 this AM.
   - Continue beta blockers peri-operatively.
   # Anemia:
   Current HCT is stable at 30; however, at risk for acute blood loss
   anemia with fractures and therapeutic on heparin.
   - Post-op serial HCTs today
   # Leukocytosis:
   Acute stress from fracture, steroid usage, vs. infection.  UA negative,
   CXR without infiltrate.
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Consider blood cx.
   - Repeat in AM.
   # Hypertension:
   BPs in 100-160s here and has been stable
   # Hypothryoidism
   - Continue home dose.
   # Osteoporosis:
   Intolerant of bisphos in past.  Continue vitamin D and calcium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE).
- She was admitted with multiple fractures after falling at a rehabilitation facility and required increased oxygen.
- The patient has been on heparin therapy and has received blood products.
- She is scheduled for surgery to repair her fractures.
- The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, which could be due to worsening pulmonary clot burden, volume overload, infection, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), hypoventilation from pain or narcotics, or other causes.
- The patient's troponin levels have been elevated, indicating possible ACS, but it is not the sole cause of hypoxia.
- The patient is also at risk for respiratory acidosis, hypoventilation, and delirium postoperatively.
- The patient's recent PE is being managed with anticoagulation, which has been temporarily stopped overnight for surgery.
- The patient has a history of diarrhea and dehydration, for which she was admitted previously.
- The patient has ECG changes and anemia, and there are concerns about leukocytosis, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.
- The patient is intolerant to bisphosphonates for osteoporosis management.
- The patient's nutritional status and glycemic control are being monitored in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with HTN, osteoporosis, recent DVT/PE (diagnosed 6 days ago),
   admit with multiple fractures following fall at rehab with increased
   oxygen requirement.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient has known recent acute PE, discharged on 2 L NC.  Reason for
   acute worsening unclear - differential includes worsening pulmonary
   clot burden (thrombotic or fat embolus; IVC filter in place and
   therapeutic on heparin); volume overload (possible given clinical
   appearance); infection (no pneumonia on current film), ACS (mild
   elevation in troponins following admission, but now stable),
   hypoventilation from pain or narcotics. Despite troponin elevation to
   0.20, ACS likely not sole cause of hypoxia. Patient with RR to 8 or
   less with narcotics.
   - Consider ongoing furosemide to attempt to reduce dependence on
   supplemental oxygen
   - NC as needed for oxygenation
   - Minimize narcotics if at all possible
   - ABG prn, may have respiratory acidosis as well if hypoventilating
   - Consideration on intubation pre-op if worsening (patient DNR/DNI in
   past, but family okay with intubation if respiratory decompensation
   prior to OR).
   - Heparin anticoagulation
   #  R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior
   pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures:
   Ortho following and planning to take to OR today. Heparin drip has been
   on hold. Is receiving FFP prior to surgery. Had two units of PRBC as
   requested by orthopedic surgery yesterday. Pain consult service will
   help to manage with epidural catheter.
   - Surgery today
   - Pain control with prn IV morphine and standing tylenol
   - Monitor for delerium post op (high risk)
   - Restart anticoagulation at therapeutic dosing post op when possible.
   # Anemia:
   Current HCT had appropriate rise from 23.3 to 27.3 following one unit
   PRBC transfusion this AM.
   - Every six hour HCTs today
   # Recent PE:
   Patient has large L common femoral vein DVT had IVC filter placed on
   [**2132-5-22**] and was anti-coagulated following. Anticoagulation has been
   restarted.
   - Continue heparin drip for now and consider restarting warfarin if HCT
   stable in next day.
   # Diarrhea:
   Recent admission for diarrhea/dehydration. ?IBD related with good
   response to oral steroids.  Has been on 60 mg prednisone since [**5-21**]
   (four days). This was stopped in peri-operative setting. Currently has
   no diarrhea. Some concern that patient hasn
t had BM recently in
   setting of systemic opiates.
   - Discontinue opium tincture
   - Continue bismuth, loperamide
   - Eventual outpatient colonoscopy as per plans at last discharge.
   # ECG changes.
   Anterior TWI new since last ECG, but had had similar changes prior.
   Troponin initially 0.09; however, climbed up to 0.20 day after
   admission. Remained stable.
   - Continue to monitor via telemetry
   # Leukocytosis:
   Has been afebrile. Acute stress from fracture, steroid usage, vs.
   infection.  UA negative, CXR without infiltrate.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypertension:
   BPs in 100-160s here and has been stable
   # Hypothryoidism
   - Continue home dose levothyroxine
   # Osteoporosis:
   Intolerant of bisphos in past.
   - Continue vitamin D and calcium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). The patient was admitted with multiple fractures after a fall at a rehabilitation facility and increased oxygen requirement. The patient's condition has been unstable, with worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient underwent orthopedic surgery to fix her fractures and received blood transfusions. She is currently on a heparin drip for anticoagulation and pain management with epidural catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to several factors including worsening pulmonary clot burden, volume overload, infection, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or hypoventilation from pain or narcotics. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ABG analysis is necessary. Intubation may be considered pre-op if there is worsening respiratory decompensation prior to surgery.
2. Fractures: The patient has multiple fractures, including a right femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, and right sacral fractures. Surgery is planned to address these fractures. Pain management and prevention of delirium post-op are important considerations.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has been appropriately rising after blood transfusions. Close monitoring of HCT levels is necessary, and further transfusions may"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of sacral, right hip, and pubic ramus fractures. She underwent repair of her hip fracture yesterday and was started on heparin post-op. She has a known history of DVT/PE and is currently in the ICU. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 112/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving morphine sulfate and heparin infusions. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress, which has improved. She has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her lab results show an elevated white blood cell count and slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level. Her cardiac enzymes and troponin levels are within normal limits. The patient's pain is being managed with oxycodone and morphine for breakthrough pain. She is at risk for fluid overload and will be redosed with lasix. She will continue to receive systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis. She is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor and has a midline and arterial line in place. The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with HTN, osteoporosis, recent DVT/PE (diagnosed 6 days ago),
   admit with multiple fractures following fall at rehab with increased
   oxygen requirement.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient has known recent acute PE, recently discharged on 2 L NC.
   Reason for acute worsening is overall unclear; however, despite
   troponin elevation to 0.20, ACS likely not sole cause of hypoxia.
   Multiple fractures may have been responsible for fat emboli. Narcotic
   hypoventilation a possibility as patient did not have worsening hypoxia
   until presentation to the ED (in which she received narcotics) and has
   RR to 8 or less with narcotics. Likely some component of pulmonary
   edema, which has been exacerbated by blood transfusions in last 3 days.
   - Consider ongoing furosemide to attempt to reduce dependence on
   supplemental oxygen
   - NC as needed for oxygenation
   - Minimize narcotics if at all possible
   - Heparin anticoagulation as tolerated by post-operative status
   #  R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior
   pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures:
   Ortho following and planning to take to OR today. Heparin drip has been
   on hold. Is receiving FFP prior to surgery. Had two units of PRBC as
   requested by orthopedic surgery yesterday. Pain consult service will
   help to manage with epidural catheter.
   - Surgery today
   - Pain control with prn IV morphine and standing tylenol
   - Monitor for delerium post op (high risk)
   - Restart anticoagulation at therapeutic dosing post op when possible.
   # Anemia:
   Current HCT had appropriate rise from 23.3 to 27.3 following one unit
   PRBC transfusion this AM.
   - Every six hour HCTs today
   # Recent PE:
   Patient has large L common femoral vein DVT had IVC filter placed on
   [**2132-5-22**] and was anti-coagulated following. Anticoagulation has been
   restarted.
   - Continue heparin drip for now and consider restarting warfarin if HCT
   stable in next day.
   # Diarrhea:
   Recent admission for diarrhea/dehydration. ?IBD related with good
   response to oral steroids.  Has been on 60 mg prednisone since [**5-21**]
   (four days). This was stopped in peri-operative setting. Currently has
   no diarrhea. Some concern that patient hasn
t had BM recently in
   setting of systemic opiates.
   - Discontinue opium tincture
   - Continue bismuth, loperamide
   - Eventual outpatient colonoscopy as per plans at last discharge.
   # ECG changes.
   Anterior TWI new since last ECG, but had had similar changes prior.
   Troponin initially 0.09; however, climbed up to 0.20 day after
   admission. Remained stable.
   - Continue to monitor via telemetry
   # Leukocytosis:
   Has been afebrile. Acute stress from fracture, steroid usage, vs.
   infection.  UA negative, CXR without infiltrate.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypertension:
   BPs in 100-160s here and has been stable
   # Hypothryoidism
   - Continue home dose levothyroxine
   # Osteoporosis:
   Intolerant of bisphos in past.
   - Continue vitamin D and calcium.

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). She was admitted with multiple fractures after a fall at a rehabilitation center and increased oxygen requirement. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, right femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior pubic ramus fractures, right sacral fractures, anemia, recent PE, diarrhea, ECG changes, leukocytosis, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has known recent acute PE, recently discharged on 2 L NC. Reason for acute worsening is unclear, but multiple fractures may have been responsible for fat emboli. Narcotic hypoventilation is also a possibility. Some component of pulmonary edema, exacerbated by blood transfusions in the last 3 days, should be considered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a right hip fracture and hypoxia. The patient has experienced melanic stools on two occasions, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's PTT is elevated at 120, suggesting a possible coagulation disorder. The patient has been started on heparin, which may have contributed to the bleeding.

The patient's vital signs show stable temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure within normal ranges. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are also within normal limits. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,032 mL and a total output of 1,585 mL, with urine output of 1,585 mL. The patient's blood products and IV fluids are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles in the lungs, indicating potential pulmonary involvement. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, but bowel sounds are present. The neurological examination shows the patient is oriented x 2 and repeats questions.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a low hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 14.0. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Electrolyte levels show mild imbalances, including hyponatremia (sodium 24 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (potassium 3.0 mEq/L).

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with HTN, osteoporosis, recent DVT/PE (diagnosed 6 days ago),
   admit with multiple fractures following fall at rehab with increased
   oxygen requirement.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient has known recent acute PE, recently discharged on 2 L NC.
   Reason for acute worsening is overall unclear; however, despite
   troponin elevation to 0.20, ACS likely not sole cause of hypoxia.
   Multiple fractures may have been responsible for fat emboli. Narcotic
   hypoventilation a possibility as patient did not have worsening hypoxia
   until presentation to the ED (in which she received narcotics) and has
   RR to 8 or less with narcotics. Likely some component of pulmonary
   edema, which has been exacerbated by blood transfusions in last 3 days.
   - Consider ongoing furosemide to attempt to reduce dependence on
   supplemental oxygen
   - NC as needed for oxygenation
   - Minimize narcotics if at all possible
   - Heparin anticoagulation as tolerated by post-operative status
   #  R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior
   pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures:
   POD#2 s/p IM nail to right femur. Orthopaedics have reported that there
   is no weight bearing restriction on patient at this time. Pain control
   has been
   - Standing Tylenol every six hours
   - Oxycodone 5 mg PO every 6 hours as needed
   - Continue morphine IV as needed for more immediate pain relief with
   hope that oral regimen will supplant this need
   - PT consult
   # Anemia:
   Patient needed one unit PRBC yesterday indicated for falling HCT. Had
   melanic stools x 2.
   - Stop heparin drip until resolution of melanic stools
   - Continue to guaiac stools
   - Every six hour HCTs today
   - Transfuse for HCT rapid change or < 21
   # Recent PE:
   Patient has large L common femoral vein DVT had IVC filter placed on
   [**2132-5-22**] and was anti-coagulated following. Anticoagulation was stopped
   peri-operatively and restarted following surgery; however, patient has
   new melanic stools in last two days.
   - Stop heparin drip due to melanic stools
   - Initiate heparin subcutaneous
   # Diarrhea:
   Recent admission for diarrhea/dehydration. ?IBD related with good
   response to oral steroids.  Had been on 60 mg prednisone since [**5-21**]
   (four days). This was stopped in peri-operative setting due to concern
   for impaired wound healing. Currently has no diarrhea, though several
   melanic stools.
   - Continue to hold opium tincture and steroids
   - Continue bismuth, loperamide
   - Contact Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] regarding diarrhea at this time
   - Eventual outpatient colonoscopy as per plans at last discharge
   # ECG changes.
   Anterior TWI new since last ECG, but had had similar changes prior.
   Troponin initially 0.09; however, climbed up to 0.20 day after
   admission. Remained stable.
   - Continue to monitor via telemetry
   # Leukocytosis:
   Has been afebrile. Acute stress from fracture, steroid usage, vs.
   infection.  UA negative, CXR without infiltrate.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypertension:
   BPs in 100-160s here and has been stable
   # Hypothryoidism
   - Continue home dose levothyroxine
   # Osteoporosis:
   Intolerant of bisphos in past.
   - Continue vitamin D and calcium.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). She was admitted with multiple fractures following a fall at a rehabilitation facility and increased oxygen requirement. She has a right femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior pubic ramus fractures, and right sacral fractures. She underwent internal fixation of the right femoral fracture and is currently on pain control medication. The patient also has anemia, recent PE, diarrhea, ECG changes, leukocytosis, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's known recent acute PE, multiple fractures, and narcotic hypoventilation could contribute to ongoing hypoxia. Pulmonary edema exacerbated by blood transfusions in the last 3 days may also be a factor. Consider ongoing furosemide to reduce dependence on supplemental oxygen and minimize narcotics if possible.
2. Fractures: The patient has multiple fractures which may lead to complications such as non-union, malunion, or infection. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient needed a blood transfusion yesterday due to falling hemoglobin concentration. Continuing to monitor hemoglobin levels and transfuse as needed for rapid change or <21.
4. Recent PE: The patient has a history of recent D"

   troponin elevation to 0.20, ACS likely not sole cause of hypoxia.
   Multiple fractures may have been responsible for fat emboli. Narcotic
   hypoventilation a possibility as patient did not have worsening hypoxia
   until presentation to the ED (in which she received narcotics) and has
   RR to 8 or less with narcotics. Likely some component of pulmonary
   edema, which has been exacerbated by blood transfusions in last 3 days.
   - Consider ongoing furosemide to attempt to reduce dependence on
   supplemental oxygen
   - NC as needed for oxygenation
   - Minimize narcotics if at all possible
   - Heparin anticoagulation as tolerated by post-operative status
   #  R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior
   pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures:
   POD#2 s/p IM nail to right femur. Orthopaedics have reported that there
   is no weight bearing restriction on patient at this time. Pain control
   has been
   - Standing Tylenol every six hours
   - Oxycodone 5 mg PO every 6 hours as needed
   - Continue morphine IV as needed for more immediate pain relief with
   hope that oral regimen will supplant this need
   - PT consult
   # Anemia:
   Patient needed one unit PRBC yesterday indicated for falling HCT. Had
   melanic stools x 2.
   - Stop heparin drip until resolution of melanic stools
   - Continue to guaiac stools
   - Every six hour HCTs today
   - Transfuse for HCT rapid change or < 21
   # Recent PE:
   Patient has large L common femoral vein DVT had IVC filter placed on
   [**2132-5-22**] and was anti-coagulated following. Anticoagulation was stopped
   peri-operatively and restarted following surgery; however, patient has
   new melanic stools in last two days.
   - Stop heparin drip due to melanic stools
   - Initiate heparin subcutaneous
   # Diarrhea:
   Recent admission for diarrhea/dehydration. ?IBD related with good
   response to oral steroids.  Had been on 60 mg prednisone since [**5-21**]
   (four days). This was stopped in peri-operative setting due to concern
   for impaired wound healing. Currently has no diarrhea, though several
   melanic stools.
   - Continue to hold opium tincture and steroids
   - Continue bismuth, loperamide
   - Contact Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] regarding diarrhea at this time
   - Eventual outpatient colonoscopy as per plans at last discharge
   # ECG changes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (diagnosed 6 days ago), multiple fractures following a fall at a rehabilitation facility, increased oxygen requirement, and hypoxia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has known recent acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and was recently discharged on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. The cause of acute worsening hypoxia is unclear, but multiple factors such as fat emboli from fractures, narcotic-induced hypoventilation, and pulmonary edema may be contributing. The patient is currently on furosemide to reduce dependence on supplemental oxygen and minimize narcotics.

2. Right femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, and right sacral fractures: The patient underwent internal fixation of the right femur fracture. Orthopedics reported that there are no weight-bearing restrictions at this time. Pain control is being managed with Tylenol, oxycodone, and morphine IV as needed.

3. Anemia: The patient needed a blood transfusion yesterday due to a falling hematocrit (HCT). Melanic stools have been observed, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Heparin has been stopped until"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with HTN, osteoporosis, recent DVT/PE (diagnosed 6 days ago),
   admit with multiple fractures following fall at rehab with increased
   oxygen requirement.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient has known recent acute PE, discharged on 2 L NC.  Reason for
   acute worsening unclear - differential includes worsening pulmonary
   clot burden (thrombotic or fat embolus; IVC filter in place and
   therapeutic on heparin); volume overload (possible given clinical
   appearance); infection (no pneumonia on current film), ACS (mild
   elevation in troponins following admission, but now stable),
   hypoventilation from pain or narcotics. Despite troponin elevation to
   0.20, ACS likely not sole cause of hypoxia. Patient with RR to 8 or
   less with narcotics.
   - Consider ongoing furosemide to attempt to reduce dependence on
   supplemental oxygen
   - NC as needed for oxygenation
   - Minimize narcotics if at all possible
   - ABG prn, may have respiratory acidosis as well if hypoventilating
   - Consideration on intubation pre-op if worsening (patient DNR/DNI in
   past, but family okay with intubation if respiratory decompensation
   prior to OR).
   - Heparin anticoagulation
   #  R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior
   pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures:
   Ortho following and planning to take to OR today. Heparin drip has been
   on hold. Is receiving FFP prior to surgery. Had two units of PRBC as
   requested by orthopedic surgery yesterday. Pain consult service will
   help to manage with epidural catheter.
   - Surgery today
   - Pain control with prn IV morphine and standing tylenol
   - Monitor for delerium post op (high risk)
   - Restart anticoagulation at therapeutic dosing post op when possible.
   # Anemia:
   Current HCT had appropriate rise from 23.3 to 27.3 following one unit
   PRBC transfusion this AM.
   - Every six hour HCTs today
   # Recent PE:
   Patient has large L common femoral vein DVT had IVC filter placed on
   [**2132-5-22**] and was anti-coagulated following. Anticoagulation has been
   restarted.
   - Continue heparin drip for now and consider restarting warfarin if HCT
   stable in next day.
   # Diarrhea:
   Recent admission for diarrhea/dehydration. ?IBD related with good
   response to oral steroids.  Has been on 60 mg prednisone since [**5-21**]
   (four days). This was stopped in peri-operative setting. Currently has
   no diarrhea. Some concern that patient hasn
t had BM recently in
   setting of systemic opiates.
   - Discontinue opium tincture
   - Continue bismuth, loperamide
   - Eventual outpatient colonoscopy as per plans at last discharge.
   # ECG changes.
   Anterior TWI new since last ECG, but had had similar changes prior.
   Troponin initially 0.09; however, climbed up to 0.20 day after
   admission. Remained stable.
   - Continue to monitor via telemetry
   # Leukocytosis:
   Has been afebrile. Acute stress from fracture, steroid usage, vs.
   infection.  UA negative, CXR without infiltrate.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypertension:
   BPs in 100-160s here and has been stable
   # Hypothryoidism
   - Continue home dose levothyroxine
   # Osteoporosis:
   Intolerant of bisphos in past.
   - Continue vitamin D and calcium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). She was admitted with multiple fractures following a fall at a rehabilitation facility and increased oxygen requirement. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's acute worsening of hypoxia is unclear, but possible causes include worsening pulmonary clot burden, volume overload, infection, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or hypoventilation due to pain or narcotics. The patient is being managed with supplemental oxygen as needed, minimizing narcotics, and consideration for intubation pre-operatively if necessary.

2. Right femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures: The patient is scheduled for surgery today and is receiving pain management with epidural catheter. Post-operative delirium is a high risk, and anticoagulation will be restarted post-operatively when possible.

3. Anemia: The patient's HCT has improved from 23.3 to 27.3 following a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion. Close monitoring of HCTs every six hours is recommended.

4. Recent PE: The patient had a large left common femoral vein DVT and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed"

   Assessment and Plan
   Melena/GIB:  will hold heparin given melena and need for transfusion.
   Given that she has an IVC filter low risk for this.
   Pain control:  Increase oxycodone dose
   pulmonary edema:  CXR with increased edema, will give a dose of lasix
   hip fracture:  moblize as tolerated
   diarrhea:  has only had [**Hospital1 7**] BMs.  off steroids

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with osteoporosis, who experienced a fall leading to pelvic and hip fractures. She underwent hip replacement surgery and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with melena yesterday and this morning, despite having a stable hematocrit level. She is on heparin sodium infusion, furosemide, and morphine sulfate. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/53 to 157/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals crackles at the lung bases and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. The patient's creatinine and blood glucose levels are within normal limits. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's melena suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be a result of anticoagulation therapy or other underlying conditions. Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of crackles at the lung bases and increased pulmonary edema on chest X-ray may indicate fluid overload or heart failure. Administration of Lasix can help alleviate symptoms"
