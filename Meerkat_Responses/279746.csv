","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of stroke and hemorrhagic CVA, abdominal pain, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 98/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving fluid resuscitation and has been started on dialysis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to the assessment of peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic status not being assessed. The patient is currently on multiple medications including lorazepam, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and piperacillin. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis without organ dysfunction indicates a systemic infection that could progress to septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate levels suggest potential tissue hypoperfusion and impaired oxygen utilization, which may indicate developing organ dysfunction.
3. Stroke: Given the patient's history of stroke, there is a risk"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with renal failure on hemodialysis who presented with hypotension, fever, and a history of gastrointestinal tube placement and cystoscopy. The patient has multiple potential infectious sources including intra-abdominal, urosepsis, and necrotic toe. There are concerns about resistant Gram-negative rods. The patient has been hospitalized for some time, which increases the risk of antibiotic resistance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to under-resuscitation from volume or an ongoing infection. It is important to continue IV fluid boluses and consider intubation if the patient's condition worsens.
2. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of systemic infection with fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia. The source of infection is likely from the urinary tract, but intra-abdominal or skin infections should also be considered. Empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam is recommended.
3. Pneumoperitoneum: The patient has continued pneumoperitoneum post-peg placement, indicating a possible perforation or leak. Surgical intervention is necessary to address this issue.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is currently on hemodialysis. Further management will involve careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with fever, hypotension, and abdominal pain. The abdominal CT did not show any g-tube leak, and the patient's lactate levels are decreasing. Blood pressure is stable, and abdominal pain has improved. The patient has allergies to NSAIDs and sulfa antibiotics. They have been receiving various medications including fluconazole, piperacillin, lorazepam, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.2Â°C, current temperature of 35.6Â°C, heart rate within normal range, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a normal ABG result. On physical examination, the patient is awake and alert, but has an absent right distal pulse and extreme necrotic right toes. Lung sounds are clear, and the abdomen is non-tender and soft. The patient's skin was not assessed, and they are responding to simple questions.

Lab results show a low white blood cell count, low hematocrit, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, normal glucose levels, and abnormal coagulation profile. Other lab values are within normal range or not provided.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has free abdominal air and a left psoas collection, but the abdominal CT is reassuring and surgery is planned with vancomycin and zosyn. Tachycardia has improved, hypotension has resolved, and foot ischemia requires local wound care. A DVT filter has been placed, and the patient has a Foley catheter in place. The patient is being treated for a urinary tract infection, seizures, end-stage renal disease, and bladder outflow obstruction. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's disposition is planned as a transfer to the floor."

","Summary:
The patient presents with a chief complaint of fever, hypotension, and abdominal pain. The abdominal CT did not show any signs of a gastrointestinal tube leak. The patient's lactate levels are decreasing. The patient has allergies to NSAIDs and sulfonamide antibiotics. They received fluconazole and piperacillin antibiotics on the previous day and today. The patient is currently receiving various medications including lorazepam, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. There are no significant changes in the patient's medical or family history, review of systems, or physical examination except for the absence of abdominal pain.

24-hour events include an EKG, dialysis catheter insertion, and blood cultures. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 106/60 to 83/56 mmHg, heart rate between 85 and 133 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's blood products and fluid balance are within normal limits. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with 2 liters per minute oxygen flow and has a normal ABG result.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 268 K/uL, creatinine level of 3.3 mg"

   85 y/o M w/ Renal failure on [**Hospital 1371**] transferred to ICU for hypotension and
   fever, s/p G-tube placement and cystoscopy, now with BP at baseline on
   vanc/zosyn/fluconazole
   .
   # Resolved Hypotension: Fluid responsive, and dropped BP with morphine
   suggesting under resuscitation from volume.  Multiple possible
   infectious sources including intraabdominal, urosepsis and necrotic
   toe.  Has been hospitalized for some time so would be concerned for
   resistant GNR's.  EF somewhat depressed on last echo, but without overt
   signs of heart failure c/w cardiogenic hypotension.
   - tx with vanco zosyn for sepsis, although no source found; continue to
   f/u cultures
   - hypotension likely normal autonomic dysregulation in chronically ill
   dialysis patient
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient no longer hypotensive. Urine source probable, also
   consider intraabdominal or SSTI as above.  Leukocytosis resolving.  BPs
   intermittently low but responsive to fluids thus far. Patient is
   responding to vanc/zosyn. Patient continues to have intraabdominal
   fluid collection, will consider as source if patient respikes.
   - f/u urine, blood, other culture data.
   - Vanc and zosyn for empiric coverage.
   .
   # Pneumoperitoneum: s/p PEG with continued pneumoperitoneum and tense
   abdomen.  Surgery followed the patient and CT with GI contrast did not
   show any evidence of leak from the G-tube. Surgery saw the patient on
   [**2-4**] and confirmed that the G-tube was okay to use.
   - reaching goal feeds, [**Doctor First Name 213**] to sign off
   -
   # ARF with CKD.  Now on HD.  Tunnelled line in place.
   - HD today, tolerating well
   - vanc dosed via HD protocol
   .
   # Hematuria with difficult foley placement: Leaking around foley.
   Urology following.
   - Would not replace foley
   - Treat through UTI.
   - If clots call urology.
   - continue fluconazole for treatment of urinary yeast.
   .
   # LE Wounds: Necrotic toes, local wound care.  Does not have evidence
   of superinfection/wet gangrene currently.
   - f/u vascular rec's
   .
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.
   - cont keppra
   .
   # Large subdural hematoma: As per HPI.  CT head if any change in
   neurological status.
   .
   # DVT: H/o prior DVT w/ IVC filter. Developed SDH in the setting of
   heparin gtt.
   - continue to hold anticoagulation
   .
   # Anemia: Improved post-transfusion, continue to trend.  Some concern
   for bleeding on CT a/p but lower on differential for current
   hypotension.  Appropriate bump to transfusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and hemorrhagic stroke, as well as abdominal pain. There is also a diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, except for low blood pressure which has stabilized with intravenous fluid administration. The patient's fluid balance shows an overall positive balance. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and the ABG results show a slight decrease in oxygen saturation. Physical examination findings are not assessed in several areas. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient currently has sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is a possibility of progression to septic shock or organ failure if the infection spreads or if the patient's condition worsens.
2. Stroke: Given the patient's history of CVA and hemorrhagic stroke, there is a risk of recurrent stroke or neurological deterioration.
3. UTI: The patient's diagnosis of UTI may require appropriate antibiotic treatment and monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or complications such as pyelonephritis.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient's history of abdominal"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o M w/ Renal failure on [**Hospital 1371**] transferred to ICU for hypotension and
   fever, s/p G-tube placement and cystoscopy, now with BP at baseline on
   vanc/zosyn/fluconazole
   .
   # Resolved Hypotension: Fluid responsive, and dropped BP with morphine
   suggesting under resuscitation from volume.  Multiple possible
   infectious sources including intraabdominal, urosepsis and necrotic
   toe.  Has been hospitalized for some time so would be concerned for
   resistant GNR's.  EF somewhat depressed on last echo, but without overt
   signs of heart failure c/w cardiogenic hypotension.  Patient
s pressure
   came up to MAP>60 and SBP>90 with NS 250cc X4 and lactate trending
   downward. Pressures on admission were 88/56 and pressures are currently
   higher., patient is mentating fine, urine output is not useful since HD
   patient, and HR came down from 110 to 80s.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient no longer hypotensive. Urine source probable, also
   consider intraabdominal or SSTI as above.  Leukocytosis resolving.  BPs
   intermittently low but responsive to fluids thus far. Patient is
   responding to vanc/zosyn. Patient continues to have intraabdominal
   fluid collection, will consider as source if patient respikes.
   - f/u urine, blood, other culture data.
   - Vanc and zosyn for empiric coverage.
   .
   # Pneumoperitoneum: s/p PEG with continued pneumoperitoneum and tense
   abdomen.  Surgery followed the patient and CT with GI contrast did not
   show any evidence of leak from the G-tube. Surgery saw the patient on
   [**2-4**] and confirmed that the G-tube was okay to use.
   -
   # ARF with CKD.  Now on HD.  Tunnelled line in place.
   - Hold on HD today given instability. Should get HD [**2-5**].
   - Consider CVVH in next 1-2 days if unable to safely have complete HD
   sessions given hypotension.
   - vanc dosed via HD protocol
   .
   # Hematuria with difficult foley placement: Leaking around foley.
   Urology following.
   - Would not replace foley
   - Treat through UTI.
   - If clots call urology.
   - continue fluconazole for treatment of urinary yeast.
   .
   # LE Wounds: Necrotic toes, local wound care.  Does not have evidence
   of superinfection/wet gangrene currently.
   - f/u vascular rec's
   .
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.
   - cont keppra
   .
   # Large subdural hematoma: As per HPI.  CT head if any change in
   neurological status.
   .
   # DVT: H/o prior DVT w/ IVC filter. Developed SDH in the setting of
   heparin gtt.
   - continue to hold anticoagulation
   .
   # Anemia: Improved post-transfusion, continue to trend.  Some concern
   for bleeding on CT a/p but lower on differential for current
   hypotension.  Appropriate bump to transfusion.

 G tube okay to use, will resume tube feeds, placed back on PO

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with renal failure who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and fever. The patient underwent G-tube placement and cystoscopy. The patient's blood pressure is currently at baseline on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. 

The patient's recent events include using a G-tube per doctor's recommendations, changing medications to oral form, experiencing intermittent belly pain treated with morphine, and having stable blood pressures with 2 liters of intravenous fluids over the course of the day. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7Â°C (96.3Â°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/47 mmHg to 140/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant findings except for tender epigastrium and dry gangrene of right lower extremity toes. The patient is unable to stand. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, as well as decreased platelet count and potassium levels. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Resolved Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved with intravenous fluids and morphine.
2. Sepsis: The patient is no longer hypotensive, but there is a probable urine source,"

   85 y/o M w/ Renal failure on [**Hospital 1371**] transferred to ICU for hypotension and
   fever, s/p G-tube placement and cystoscopy, now with BP at baseline on
   vanc/zosyn/fluconazole
   .
   # Resolved Hypotension: Fluid responsive, and dropped BP with morphine
   suggesting under resuscitation from volume.  Multiple possible
   infectious sources including intraabdominal, urosepsis and necrotic
   toe.  Has been hospitalized for some time so would be concerned for
   resistant GNR's.  EF somewhat depressed on last echo, but without overt
   signs of heart failure c/w cardiogenic hypotension.
   - tx with vanco zosyn for sepsis, although no source found; continue to
   f/u cultures
   - hypotension likely normal autonomic dysregulation in chronically ill
   dialysis patient
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient no longer hypotensive. Urine source probable, also
   consider intraabdominal or SSTI as above.  Leukocytosis resolving.  BPs
   intermittently low but responsive to fluids thus far. Patient is
   responding to vanc/zosyn. Patient continues to have intraabdominal
   fluid collection, will consider as source if patient respikes.
   - f/u urine, blood, other culture data.
   - Vanc and zosyn for empiric coverage.
   .
   # Pneumoperitoneum: s/p PEG with continued pneumoperitoneum and tense
   abdomen.  Surgery followed the patient and CT with GI contrast did not
   show any evidence of leak from the G-tube. Surgery saw the patient on
   [**2-4**] and confirmed that the G-tube was okay to use.

   # ARF with CKD.  Now on HD.  Tunnelled line in place.
   - HD today, tolerating well
   - vanc dosed via HD protocol

   # Hematuria with difficult foley placement: Leaking around foley.
   Urology following.
   - Would not replace foley
   - Treat through UTI.
   - If clots call urology.
   - continue fluconazole for treatment of urinary yeast.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with renal failure who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and fever. He underwent a gastrointestinal tube placement and cystoscopy, and his blood pressure is currently at baseline on vancomycin (vanc), piperacillin/tazobactam (zosyn), and fluconazole.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Resolved Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is believed to be due to under-resuscitation from fluids. He responded well to morphine, suggesting a possible infectious source such as intraabdominal, urosepsis, or necrotic toe. He is being treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole for sepsis, although no source has been identified. Cultures will be followed up.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but he remains at risk for sepsis due to probable urinary tract infection, intraabdominal infection, or surgical site infection. Leukocytosis is resolving, and the patient is responding to vanc/zosyn. If the patient's condition worsens, an intraabdominal fluid collection may be considered as a source of infection. Cultures will continue to be monitored.
3. Pneumoperitoneum: The patient had a pneumoperitoneum after a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedure, but a"

   # Resolved Hypotension: Fluid responsive, and dropped BP with morphine
   suggesting under resuscitation from volume.  Multiple possible
   infectious sources including intraabdominal, urosepsis and necrotic
   toe.  Has been hospitalized for some time so would be concerned for
   resistant GNR's.  EF somewhat depressed on last echo, but without overt
   signs of heart failure c/w cardiogenic hypotension.
   - tx with vanco zosyn for sepsis, although no source found; continue to
   f/u cultures; end date [**2-12**]
   - relative hypotension likely normal autonomic dysregulation in
   chronically ill dialysis patient

   # Sepsis: Patient no longer hypotensive. Urine source probable, also
   consider intraabdominal or SSTI as above.  Leukocytosis resolving.  BPs
   intermittently low but responsive to fluids thus far. Patient is
   responding to vanc/zosyn. Patient continues to have intraabdominal
   fluid collection, will consider as source if patient respikes.
   - Vanc and zosyn for empiric coverage since no obvious source and
   patient responding well, see above for course (2 wk total).
   .
   # SVT
 pt with intermittent SVT to 140s, asymptomatic, breaks with
   vagal maneuvers

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of renal failure who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and fever. The patient underwent G-tube placement and cystoscopy, and is currently being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluconazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 102/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals tenderness and guarding in the epigastrium, dry gangrene of the right lower extremity toes, and 2+ edema in the left leg. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's medical conditions include sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, large subdural hematoma, deep vein thrombosis, and anemia. The patient is currently on dialysis and has a tunnelled dialysis line in place. The patient's current plan includes continued empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, close monitoring of fluid balance, and ongoing management of multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to immunosup"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with renal failure who has been hospitalized for some time. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and fever and underwent several interventions including G-tube placement and cystoscopy. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is at baseline on vancomycin (vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (zosyn), suggesting that the hypotension may be due to under-resuscitation from volume. The patient also received morphine, which further supports this theory.

2. Sepsis: Although no source of infection has been identified, the patient is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for sepsis. The cultures are being monitored, and the possibility of resistant Gram-negative rods is considered.

3. Pneumoperitoneum: The patient had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement with continued pneumoperitoneum and a tense abdomen. Surgery confirmed that the G-tube was okay to use, and the patient is reaching goal feeds.

4. Acute renal failure with chronic kidney disease (ARF with CKD): The patient is now on hemodialysis (HD) and tolerating it well. The dosing of vancomycin is adjusted via HD protocol.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of renal failure, who was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and fever. The patient has undergone several procedures, including G-tube placement, cystoscopy, and has been on dialysis. The patient is currently on antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) for sepsis, and also being treated for urinary yeast with fluconazole. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/72 to 148/132 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with hypotension and fever, suggesting a possible infection. The current treatment plan includes antibiotics for sepsis, indicating the ongoing concern for infection.
2. Intraabdominal infection: There is a concern for an intraabdominal source of infection, as the patient has had recent abdominal surgery and continues to have intraabdominal fluid collections.
3. Necrotic toes: The patient has dry gangrene of the right lower extremity toes, which may require further evaluation and treatment to prevent infection or progression.
4. Large subdural hematoma: The patient has a large subdural hematoma, which could potentially lead to neurological complications if there is any"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of renal failure, who was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and fever. He has been hospitalized for some time and has multiple potential infectious sources including intraabdominal, urosepsis, and necrotic toe. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluconazole for sepsis. He also has a history of depressed ejection fraction, but without overt signs of heart failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on dialysis and has a tunnelled line in place. The patient has a history of difficult Foley placement with subsequent hematuria and leaking around the Foley catheter. He is being treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection and is scheduled for follow-up with urology in two weeks. The patient also has lower extremity wounds with necrotic toes, which are being managed with local wound care. There are several other medical issues and plans mentioned in the note, including seizures, large subdural hematoma, deep vein thrombosis, anemia, and femoral nerve dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill-appearing individual with a history of stroke, abdominal pain, and gangrene in the right lower extremity. They have been admitted to the ICU for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute and chronic pain, and suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently on multiple medications including morphine, heparin, and verapamil. They have undergone various lab tests and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's sepsis and suspected UTI indicate a risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of worsening infection, such as fever, increased heart rate, or elevated white blood cell count, is essential.
2. Gangrene and Amputation: The presence of dry gangrene in the right lower extremity suggests compromised blood flow. This can lead to further tissue necrosis and potentially require amputation. Regular assessment of the affected area is crucial.
3. Stroke: The patient's history of CVA (cerebral infarction) indicates a risk of neurological complications. Monitoring for any new neurological deficits or changes in mental status is necessary.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) has already been present in this patient. Continuous monitoring of heart rhythm and prompt intervention if arrhythmias recur are essential.
5. Pain Management: Given the patient's acute and"
