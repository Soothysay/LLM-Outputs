   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt was admitted to ICU rather than floor post-op due to hypotension.
   Hypotension was thought to be related to A. fib with RVR with rates
   ranging from 110-120s. Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7
   hours but was still noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic.
   Differential includes A. fib with RVR given his prior history, however
   would expect a more impressive rate to give such hypotension. Other
   differentials to consider include possible sepsis that could have
   occured peri-op, he was also noted to have leukocytosis prior to his
   operation. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given.   Pt mentating
   well currently. Changed abx of Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Zosyn (for broad
   Gram positive, negative coverage) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt
   received Diltiazem and is on Morphine PCA which could also explain the
   hypotension. Hypotension could also be reaction to anaesthesia
   medications during surgery, would expect hypotension to improve once
   medications start to clear.
   - will add on diff to prior CBC
 clearly left shifted.
   - urine, bld culture
   - Bolus prn
   - d/c Ceftriaxone and Vanc
   - start Zosyn, Linezolid (prior regimen when pt was septic)
   - if cx negative after 48hr would consider d/c'ing abx
   - trend leukocytosis and fever curve
   .
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Pt currently NPO post-op and unable to
   receive meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus
   and drip.
   - current rates running up to 120
s, would start amiodarone if BP
   improves while awake
   - when pt is cleared for PO will start on PO Dilt
   - not anticoagulated given surgery, previously on Coumadin will d/w
   surgery re: restarting anticoagulation
   .
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   s/p Ileal Conduit urinary diversion: Pt underwent  ileal conduit
   urinary diversion in addition to neobladder. Urology currently
   following pt, who is NPO per their recommendations.
   - f/u Urology recs
   - will keep NPO for now
   - Morphine PCA for pain control
   .
 LEUKOCYTOSIS
   Pt noted to have leukocytosis of 16.4 on admission. Unclear as to the
   etiology, pt does have h.o. of VRE colonization within his GU system,
   multiple infections. No fevers reported.   Left shifted today.
   - will pan culture as mentioned above
   - continue on Zosyn, Linezolid
   - trend Leukocytosis, fever curve
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   Renal Insufficiency: Pt currently sees a Nephrologist in [**Location (un) 755**] for
   his insufficiency. Prior to admission baseline Creatinine has ranged
   from 1.9-2.0. Prior Creatinine level of [**4-19**] was thought to be due to
   ATN from hypovolemia. Renal insufficiency is thought to be [**2-17**]
   obstruction from transitional bladder cell cancer with obstruction.
   - trend Creatinine
   - follow urine output
   .
   ##. Hyperchloremic Acidosis: Likely related to large volume
   resuscitation from NS.
   - continue to trend
   - if bolus required will use LR
   - monitor K+ whilst given LR given degree of renal insufficiency

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has several medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, which was initially thought to be related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, the hypotension persisted despite normal saline (NS) resuscitation. Other differentials for the hypotension include possible sepsis, which could have occurred perioperatively, as well as a history of septic shock after gastrointestinal procedures and colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

The patient's blood pressure is currently in the mid-70s, and they are asymptomatic. The patient is on morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), which could explain the hypotension. The patient's heart rate is 116 beats per minute (bpm), with an irregular rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation. Oxygen saturation is at 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature, respiratory rate, and peripheral pulses are not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.6 K/uL, a hematocrit (Hct) level of 32.8%, and a platelet count (Plt) of 192 K/uL. Blood glucose levels are elevated at 126 mg/dL. Other lab values include sodium (Na+): 138 mEq/L, potassium (K+): 4.7 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-): 106 mEq/L, carbon dioxide (CO2): 32.8%, bicarbonate (HCO3-): 16 mEq/L, magnesium (Mg++): 1.7 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++): 8.3 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4): 3.7 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post-op following a previous gastrointestinal surgery. The patient received a total of 9 liters of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during resuscitation. The patient's current rate is running up to 120, and they will start amiodarone if their blood pressure improves while awake. When the patient is cleared for oral intake, they will be started on oral diltiazem.

The patient also has a history of malignant neoplasm and underwent ileal conduit urinary diversion. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) per urology recommendations. Morphine PCA is being used for pain control.

Leukocytosis is present with a WBC count of 16.4 on admission, which is unclear in etiology. The patient has a history of colonization with VRE within the gastrointestinal system, multiple infections, and no reported fevers. The patient's leukocyt"

   Heart rate improved (still afib) with initiation of amiodarone and
   diltiazem. BP low-normal, which is the patient's baseline pressure.
   Good urine output since arrival in ICU. Contiues on antibiotics for
   possible VRE sepsis, which he has had before. Transient bacteremia may
   be more likely cause of low BP, which is now back to baseline. Has not
   required any vasopressors. Complete amiodarone load.
   Metabolic, non-gap acidosis probably due to large volumes of normal
   saline fluid resuscitation. If additional fluids required, would use
   lactated Ringers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues. The chief complaints include atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypotension, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been receiving amiodarone for their heart rate and blood pressure management. They have also received 7 liters of fluid and 2 units of blood intraoperatively.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), a heart rate in the 80-90's, blood pressure at 96/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm remains in AFib.

The patient's medical history includes malignant neoplasm, chronic renal failure, leukocytosis, and a possible VRE sepsis. The patient continues to receive antibiotics for this potential infection. There are no known drug allergies.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the AFib and hypotension. The physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight, and obese appearance without acute distress. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a normal PMI, absent S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, S3, or S4. The respiratory and abdominal examinations are also unremarkable.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemat"

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Pt currently NPO post-op and unable to
   receive meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus
   and drip. Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs. 1 dose of IV
   dilt did not improve rate significantly and it dropped BP. Volume
   overload may be contributing to difficulty with rate control. EKG this
   AM continues to show AF with RVR.
   - amiodarone gtt complete, did not start PO dosing still unclear if
   outpatient longterm amiodarone is best choice
   - trial IV dilt boluses, consider PO dosing if effective vs. dilt gtt
   if having BP issues
   - consider cardiology consult if refractory after dilt
   - restart warfarin
   - TBB goal -500 to 1L today (patient autodiuresing, can add Lasix prn)
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low
   BP in 100s. Does not appear to be infected.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a Caucasian male in the ICU who has undergone multiple surgeries, including an ileal conduit urinary diversion for malignant neoplasm. The patient's chief complaint is no specific complaints, and pain is well controlled. The patient's vital signs show an irregularly irregular heart rhythm with a rate in the 110s, blood pressure in the range of 116/71 (82) mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals no scleral icterus, good air movement bilaterally, trace pedal edema, and appropriate mental status. 

The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, increased creatinine level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response post-op following a prior genitourinary surgery. The patient's AF is currently not well controlled, and there have been attempts to manage it with amiodarone and diltiazem. The patient also has a history of chronic renal failure, and there are concerns about potential obstruction from transitional bladder cell cancer. 

The patient's recent events include receiving fluids and blood products, having ongoing management of AF, hypotension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is currently NPO as per urology recommendations.

","The patient's chief complaint is being 7L positive from the OR and PACU, appearing euvolemic, and not diuresing. The patient's heart rate ranges from 100-140 bpm and is on amiodarone drip. The blood pressure is slightly low but stable. The patient received IV diltiazem, but their blood pressure dropped slightly, so it was not repeated. Antibiotics need to be discussed with urology in the morning.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) post-op following a prior GU surgery performed last year. They received a total of 9L NS and 2u PRBC. They were given Diltiazem 120mg SR, but their rate responded to amiodarone 150mg bolus and drip. Currently, they are doing well with amiodarone bolus/drip and their rate is stable.

The patient underwent ileal conduit urinary diversion with removal of neobladder. They are currently NPO per urology recommendations. They have a history of malignancy, specifically malignant neoplasm, and chronic renal failure. Their baseline creatinine has ranged from 1.9-2.0, and prior creatinine level of 4.19 was thought to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypovolemia. The renal insufficiency is thought to be due to obstruction from"

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Initially NPO post-op and unable to receive
   meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus and drip.
   Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs.  Volume overload may be
   contributing to difficulty with rate control, with increased
   sympathetic tone post-op contributing.   Started dilt gtt yesterday
   with good response, optimal control.
   - per Cardiology, amio poor choice given h/o recurrent a. fib
   - cont dilt gtt with plan to transition to dilt 90 mg PO QID when
   cleared by Urology
   - appreciate Cardiology recs
   - restarted warfarin
   - cont to allow pt to autodiurese and improve atrial stretch
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low
   BP in 100s. Does not appear to be infected.   Cultures negative.
   Discontinued all antibiotics.  Hypotension resolved with improved rate
   control.

   his insufficiency. Prior to admission baseline Creatinine has ranged
   from 1.9-2.0. Prior Creatinine level of [**4-19**] was thought to be due to
   ATN from hypovolemia. Renal insufficiency is thought to be [**2-17**]
   obstruction from transitional bladder cell cancer with obstruction.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The summary of the patient's progress includes:

- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which was present post-op after a previous genitourinary surgery.
- The patient received diltiazem to control the heart rate, and it has been effective.
- The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is thought to be related to AF with RVR. Antibiotics were changed to target VRE and pan-sensitive E. coli. The hypotension resolved with improved rate control.
- The patient had a malignant neoplasm and underwent an ileal conduit urinary diversion. They are currently NPO per Urology recommendations.
- The patient has chronic renal failure, with baseline creatinine levels ranging from 1.9-2.0. Renal insufficiency is likely due to obstruction from transitional bladder cell cancer with obstruction.
- The patient experienced hyperchloremic acidosis, which resolved.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of AF with RVR, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potential heart failure if not managed properly.
2. Renal complications: The patient has chronic renal failure, and any further obstruction or deterioration in renal function may worsen their renal condition.
3. Infection complications: Although the patient's"

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Pt currently NPO post-op and unable to
   receive meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus
   and drip. Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs. 1 dose of IV
   dilt did not improve rate significantly and it dropped BP. Volume
   overload may be contributing to difficulty with rate control. EKG this
   AM continues to show AF with RVR.
   - amiodarone gtt complete, did not start PO dosing still unclear if
   outpatient longterm amiodarone is best choice
   - trial IV dilt boluses, consider PO dosing if effective vs. dilt gtt
   if having BP issues
   - consider cardiology consult if refractory after dilt
   - restart warfarin
   - TBB goal -500 to 1L today (patient autodiuresing, can add Lasix prn)
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low
   BP in 100s. Does not appear to be infected.

   his insufficiency. Prior to admission baseline Creatinine has ranged
   from 1.9-2.0. Prior Creatinine level of [**4-19**] was thought to be due to
   ATN from hypovolemia. Renal insufficiency is thought to be [**2-17**]
   obstruction from transitional bladder cell cancer with obstruction.
   - trend Creatinine, improving today
   - follow urine output

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a male with a chief complaint of narrow complex tachycardia. The patient's history includes atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post-op following a prior genitourinary surgery. On review of anesthesia records, the patient's atrial fibrillation was in the 100-120 range. He received intravenous fluids and blood products, as well as diltiazem 120mg SR. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB with RVR post-op. He is currently in AFIB with RVR and has been unresponsive to IV diltiazem. Amiodarone gtt was completed, but PO dosing has not been started yet. A trial of IV diltiazem boluses is being considered, along with PO dosing if effective or dilt gtt if there are no BP issues. A cardiology consult may be sought if refractory after dilt.

2. Hypotension (not shock): The patient received a total of 7L NS in the PACU but still had a BP in the mid-70s. This was thought to be due to AFIB with RVR. His BP also decreased after giving diltiazem 120mg. Antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone and linezolid. The patient's baseline low BP in the 100"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation (AF) and right ventricular pressure overload (RVR). They have been in the ICU for several days and are currently receiving various medications including diltiazem, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/39 mmHg to 143/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is AF. 

The patient has a history of cancer and has undergone surgery, as evidenced by abdominal pain near the incision site. They also have chronic renal failure with an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. Other notable lab values include leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and electrolyte imbalances including hypernatremia with a sodium level of 30 mg/dL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the bibasilar chest region, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no lower extremity edema. Neurological assessment is not complete due to patient not assessed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and presence of crack"

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Initially NPO post-op and unable to receive
   meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus and drip.
   Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs.  Volume overload may be
   contributing to difficulty with rate control, with increased
   sympathetic tone post-op contributing.   Started dilt gtt yesterday
   with good response, optimal control.
   - per Cardiology, amio poor choice given h/o recurrent a. fib
   - cont dilt gtt with plan to transition to dilt 90 mg PO QID when
   cleared by Urology
   - appreciate Cardiology recs
   - restarted warfarin
   - cont to allow pt to autodiurese and improve atrial stretch
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low
   BP in 100s. Does not appear to be infected.   Cultures negative.
   Discontinued all antibiotics.  Hypotension resolved with improved rate
   control.

 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   Renal Insufficiency: Pt currently sees a Nephrologist in [**Location (un) 755**] for
   his insufficiency. Prior to admission baseline Creatinine has ranged
   from 1.9-2.0. Prior Creatinine level of [**4-19**] was thought to be due to
   ATN from hypovolemia. Renal insufficiency is thought to be [**2-17**]
   obstruction from transitional bladder cell cancer with obstruction.
   - will check urine creatinine from JP drain

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post-operative following a prior gastrointestinal surgery.
- The patient received a total of 9 liters of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells.
- Diltiazem 120mg SR was administered at [**2033**], which helped to control the heart rate between 85-103 beats per minute.
- Initially, the patient was unable to take oral medications due to being NPO post-op.
- Amiodarone 150mg bolus and drip were given, but per cardiology recommendation, amiodarone is not the preferred choice given the patient's recurrent atrial fibrillation.
- The patient's heart rate is currently in the 120s on amiodarone infusion, with stable blood pressures.
- The patient may have volume overload contributing to difficulty with rate control, along with increased sympathetic tone post-op.
- Diltiazem infusion was started yesterday with good response, achieving optimal control.
- Plan is to transition to diltiazem 90mg PO QID when cleared by urology.
- Warfarin has been restarted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent an ileal conduit urinary diversion surgery. He has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/39 mmHg to 143/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but not using supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been receiving various medications including diltiazem, amiodarone, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and creatinine levels are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes chronic renal failure, cancer (malignant neoplasm), and previous episodes of septic shock and VRE infection. He has been receiving antibiotics but they have been discontinued due to negative cultures.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of AF with rate control using diltiazem, discontinuation of amiodarone due to a history of recurrent AF, continuation of warfarin, and allowing the patient to autodiurese and improve atrial stretch. The patient's"
