   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the
   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot.  Baseline SBPs in the 80s,
   today s/p fluid resuscitation and pressure support with pressures
   closer to baseline with good UOP.
   - wean off pressors with goal MAP >60
   - continue with IVF, bolus to OUP >50cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <27
   - continue  vanc, cipro and flagyl for peritonitis treatment pending
   culture data and final read of CT
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding.
   - NPO, NGT in place
   - coordinate care with GI and surgery
   - PICC for access, try for PIVs
   - protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <27
   - hold Coumadin for now
   ..
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   -          continue cipro/flagyl as above
   -          serial abdominal exams
   -          F/U final imaging read
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency.
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: has been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerated POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - NPO for now given GI bleeding
   - holding TPN for now for blood tx and boluses
   - restart TPN when stable
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues today, but will consider based
   on clinical course today; NPO; replete electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots
   # Communication: with family, mom in particular
   # Code: full, confirmed with family
   # Dispo: ICU for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, GI bleed, RP bleed, peritonitis, SMV thrombus, anemia, and nutrition concerns. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot. Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential, and weaning off pressors with a goal MAP >60 should be considered. 

2. GI bleed: The patient has known gastric varices and presents with blood in NGT and coffee ground emesis, concerning for GI bleed. Given the patient's improving HCT after transfusion without evidence of active bleeding, it is important to continue monitoring the patient's condition. 

3. Peritonitis: Although no positive cultures were found, the patient was presumed to have peritonitis on admission and may be the cause of the initial presentation. Serial abdominal exams and follow-up final imaging read are necessary. 

4. SMV Thrombus: The patient has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals. The plan was for 6 months of anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time. However, considering the current GI bleed, it may be necessary to hold lovenox and coumadin. The risks and benefits of long-term anticoagulation should be considered based on EGD findings and extent of bleed. 

5. Anemia: The patient has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies suggest iron deficiency. Iron supplementation should be continued after completing the GI workup. Transfusion for HCT <25 should be considered in the setting of bleed. 

6. Nutrition: The patient has been receiving TPN and GI consultation for a PEG tube for long-term feeding. However, he is currently NPO due to GI bleeding. TPN should be restarted when the patient is stable, and albumin levels should be monitored due to hypoalbuminemia. 

7. Seizure Disorder: The patient's seizure disorder is stable, with no recent reports of seizures. It is important to continue phenobarbital and phenytoin. 

8. Cerebral Palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy is stable, and he remains interactive with family although non-verbal. Mental status should be continuously monitored. 

9. FEN: The patient is on TPN and holding for access issues today. Considering the clinical course today, FEN may be considered. 

10. Access: PICC line and attempts at PIV should be continued. 

11. PPx: PPI should be held, along with anticoagulation. Pneumoboots should also be considered. 

12. Communication: Good communication with the family, especially the mother, is crucial. 

13. Code: Full code status has been confirmed with the family. 

14. Disposition: The patient should remain in the ICU for now."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # GI bleed: has blood in NGT and then coffee ground emesis worrisome
   for new upper GI bleed.  Hct of [**5-9**] not reflect active, ongoing
   bleed.  Getting IVFs and 1u PRBCs now.  Has known gastric varices which
   could be the cause of the bleed.
   - GI consulted and aware of patient, likely need EGD today
   - NPO, NGT in place, will check placement and then keep to LIS
   - PICC for access, try for PIVs
   - protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - complete 1u PRBC transfusion
   - q4hr Hcts, transfuse for hct <27 or active bleeding
   - check lactate
   - surgery following along
   .
   # Hypotension: baseline SBPs in the 80s, but has low BP to 68/doppler
   today.  Is likely secondary to GI bleed and hypovolemia, although could
   be a sign of new early infection, PE, cardiogenic shock or adrenal
   insufficiency.  These etiologies are less likely, though.  He has
   remains afebrile and has no localizing infectious symptoms, although is
   difficult to interview.  Has known SMV clot and has been slightly
   subtherpeutic on his coumadin, so may have other clots and is at risk
   of PE but is not hypoxic or with leg swelling.  No hx of cardiac
   problems or signs of pulm edema suggesting cardiac failure.  And he has
   not been on chronic steroids.
   - fluid resuccitation with IVF boluses and 1u PRBCs for now
   - levofed pressors if needed with SBP goal > 75, MAP >55
   - blood, urine cultures, c.diff
   - continue cipro and flagyl for peritonitis treatment
   - broaden abx by adding vanco for potential line infection, although
   PICC line looks uninfected on exam
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   - CXR to look for pneumonia
   - KUB to look for obstruction or new obstruction
   - EKG and CEs to rule out cardiac cause
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: was initial presentation and thought to be due to
   peritonitis from microperforations and translocation.  Has had chronic
   abdominal pain this admission with intermittent large bowel
   obstructions and chronically dilated loops of bowel.  Is passing gas
   and stooling.  Did have recent rectal tube for decompression, but fell
   out two nights ago.  Also has signs of chronic pancreatitis and an SMV
   as discussed below.  Pain could be from multiple etiologies.
   - serial abdominal exams
   - f/u final read of KUB, appears stable per HO read
   - abd pain seems at baseline
   - repeat CT abdomen to look for possible new microperf or abscess as
   source of infection, but just had CT two days ago that was stable and
   without obvious source
   - continue pancreatic enzyme repletion
   - hold anticoagulation for thrombus as below
   - morphine PRN
   - surgery following along
   .
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue cipro/flagyl as above
   - course of cipro/flagyl to complete 2 week course from ___ per floor
   team; consider ID consult if infectious workup positive
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency.
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: has been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerated POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - NPO for now given GI bleeding
   - holding TPN for now for blood tx and boluses
   - restart TPN when stable
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices.
- He was transferred with coffee ground emesis and hypotension.
- The patient has a confirmed GI bleed, with blood in the nasogastric tube and coffee ground emesis. His initial hematocrit (Hct) does not reflect active bleeding.
- Known gastric varices could be the cause of the bleed.
- The patient is hypotensive with baseline systolic blood pressures in the 80s, but has a low blood pressure of 68 today. Hypotension is likely secondary to GI bleed and hypovolemia, although other causes like early infection, pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency are less likely.
- The patient has a known superior mesenteric vein (SMV) clot and has been slightly subtherapeutic on his Coumadin, so may have other clots and is at risk for PE but is not hypoxic or with leg swelling.
- No history of cardiac problems or signs of pulmonary edema suggesting cardiac failure. He has not been on chronic steroids.
- Fluid resuscitation with IV fluids and 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has been initiated. Levofloxacin pressors are being used if needed, with a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) of >75 and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >55.
- Blood, urine cultures, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) tests have been ordered.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole) have been continued for potential peritonitis treatment, and Vancomycin has been added for potential line infection, although the PICC line looks uninfected on examination.
- Consideration is being given to broadening antibiotic coverage by adding Daptomycin if clinically worsening, as well as obtaining a chest X-ray to look for pneumonia and kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) imaging to look for obstruction or new obstruction.
- Electrolytes are being monitored and repleted as needed.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) due to the GI bleed, and NG tube placement will be checked and then kept to low intermittent suction (LIS).
- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are being continued, and phenylephrine infusion is being used to maintain blood pressure.
- The patient's abdominal pain is at baseline, and serial abdominal exams will be performed.
- Repeat CT abdomen is being considered to look for possible new microperforation or abscess as the source of infection.
- Pancreatic enzyme repletion will be continued.
- Morphine is being used for pain relief as needed.
- Surgery is being consulted along with the plan to follow up with imaging studies and ongoing monitoring.

   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the
   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot.  Baseline SBPs in the 80s,
   today s/p fluid resuscitation and pressure support with pressures
   closer to baseline with good UOP.
   - wean off pressors with goal MAP >60
   - continue with IVF, bolus to OUP >50cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <27
   - continue  vanc, cipro and flagyl for peritonitis treatment pending
   culture data and final read of CT
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding.
   - NPO, NGT in place
   - coordinate care with GI and surgery
   - PICC for access, try for PIVs
   - protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <27
   - hold Coumadin for now
   ..
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue cipro/flagyl as above
   - course of cipro/flagyl to complete 2 week course from ___ per floor
   team; consider ID consult if infectious workup positive
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency.
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: has been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerated POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - NPO for now given GI bleeding
   - holding TPN for now for blood tx and boluses
   - restart TPN when stable
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications since his admission.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, which is likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding or retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for superior mesenteric vein clot. Fluid resuscitation and pressure support have been initiated, aiming to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

2. GI Bleed: The patient has known gastric varices and is showing signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, including blood in the nasogastric tube and coffee ground emesis. Imaging suggests the possibility of GI and/or retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has improved following transfusion, but there is no evidence of active bleeding at the moment.

3. Peritonitis: Although no positive cultures were found, the patient was presumed to have peritonitis upon admission, likely causing his initial presentation. Antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) have been continued, and a two-week course of treatment is planned. An infectious disease consult may be considered if the workup shows positive results.

   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # GI bleed: has blood in NGT and then coffee ground emesis worrisome
   for new upper GI bleed.  Hct of [**5-9**] not reflect active, ongoing
   bleed.  Getting IVFs and 1u PRBCs now.  Has known gastric varices which
   could be the cause of the bleed.
   - GI consulted and aware of patient, likely need EGD today
   - NPO, NGT in place, will check placement and then keep to LIS
   - PICC for access, try for PIVs
   - protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - complete 1u PRBC transfusion
   - q4hr Hcts, transfuse for hct <27 or active bleeding
   - check lactate
   - surgery following along
   .
   # Hypotension: baseline SBPs in the 80s, but has low BP to 68/doppler
   today.  Is likely secondary to GI bleed and hypovolemia, although could
   be a sign of new early infection, PE, cardiogenic shock or adrenal
   insufficiency.  These etiologies are less likely, though.  He has
   remains afebrile and has no localizing infectious symptoms, although is
   difficult to interview.  Has known SMV clot and has been slightly
   subtherpeutic on his coumadin, so may have other clots and is at risk
   of PE but is not hypoxic or with leg swelling.  No hx of cardiac
   problems or signs of pulm edema suggesting cardiac failure.  And he has
   not been on chronic steroids.
   - fluid resuccitation with IVF boluses and 1u PRBCs for now
   - levofed pressors if needed with SBP goal > 75, MAP >55
   - blood, urine cultures, c.diff
   - continue cipro and flagyl for peritonitis treatment
   - broaden abx by adding vanco for potential line infection, although
   PICC line looks uninfected on exam
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   - CXR to look for pneumonia
   - KUB to look for obstruction or new obstruction
   - EKG and CEs to rule out cardiac cause
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: was initial presentation and thought to be due to
   peritonitis from microperforations and translocation.  Has had chronic
   abdominal pain this admission with intermittent large bowel
   obstructions and chronically dilated loops of bowel.  Is passing gas
   and stooling.  Did have recent rectal tube for decompression, but fell
   out two nights ago.  Also has signs of chronic pancreatitis and an SMV
   as discussed below.  Pain could be from multiple etiologies.
   - serial abdominal exams
   - f/u final read of KUB, appears stable per HO read
   - abd pain seems at baseline
   - repeat CT abdomen to look for possible new microperf or abscess as
   source of infection, but just had CT two days ago that was stable and
   without obvious source
   - continue pancreatic enzyme repletion
   - hold anticoagulation for thrombus as below
   - morphine PRN
   - surgery following along
   .
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue cipro/flagyl as above
   - course of cipro/flagyl to complete 2 week course from ___ per floor
   team; consider ID consult if infectious workup positive
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency.
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: has been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerated POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - NPO for now given GI bleeding
   - holding TPN for now for blood tx and boluses
   - restart TPN when stable
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues today, but will consider based
   on clinical course today; NPO; replete electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension, indicating a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's hemoglobin level is low, suggesting ongoing blood loss. He has received IV fluids and a blood transfusion. Proton pump inhibitors have been initiated to reduce stomach acid production and prevent further bleeding. 

The patient's blood pressure remains low, ranging from 76/53 to 100/73 mmHg. This could be due to the gastrointestinal bleed and hypovolemia, but other causes such as infection, pulmonary embolism, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency are less likely. 

The patient also has chronic abdominal pain, passing gas and stool, and a history of large bowel obstructions. An abdominal CT scan showed colonic wall thickening with possible bleed, rectal hematoma, and microperforation. 

In addition, the patient has a chronic superior mesenteric vein thrombus and is on anticoagulation therapy. His nutritional status is poor, and he requires long-term feeding. 

The patient's seizure disorder is stable, and he has cerebral palsy. 

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's low hemoglobin levels and coffee ground emesis suggest ongoing upper GI bleed. Further evaluation with endos"

","Summary:
The patient is a 15-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics and vasopressor support with Phenylephrine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73/52 to 87/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is awake and oriented, but has limited verbal response. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen, NGT draining bilious fluid, and good skin integrity. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and slightly elevated creatinine level. The patient has been receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension with a MAP of 54. This could be due to septic shock or other underlying causes. Close monitoring and vasopressor support are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Bilious drainage from NGT: The presence of bilious fluid draining from the nasogastric tube indicates possible gastrointestinal obstruction or ileus. Further evaluation and management are required to address this issue.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was admitted with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient has several ongoing medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension with a MAP of 54. This was initially managed with a bolus of 500cc and phenylephrine infusion. The patient's baseline systolic blood pressures are in the 80s, and fluid resuscitation and pressure support have been provided. The goal is to wean off the pressors with a target MAP >55 and SBP >75.

2. GI bleed: The patient has known gastric varices and is showing signs of GI bleeding, such as blood in the NG tube and coffee ground emesis. There is also imaging concern for GI and/or RP bleed. The patient's HCT is improving after transfusion, but active bleeding should be closely monitored. NPO status and NGT suction are in place, and coordination with GI and surgery is required.

3. Peritonitis: Although no positive cultures were obtained, the patient was presumed to have peritonitis on admission and it may have been the cause of the initial presentation. Antibiotic treatment will continue, and serial abdominal exams should be performed.

4. SMV Thrombus: The patient has a chronic SM"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including hypotension, GI bleed, peritonitis, SMV thrombus, anemia, and nutrition issues. He is currently on multiple medications including phenylephrine, fosphenytoin, vanc, cipro, and flagyl. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73/52 mmHg to 71/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies suggest the presence of gastric varices and/or RP bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating a risk of inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
2. GI bleed: The presence of coffee ground emesis, blood in NGT, and bilious fluid drainage suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding or retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for a superior mesenteric vein clot. The baseline systolic blood pressures are in the 80s, and the patient has received fluid resuscitation and pressure support with pressures closer to baseline. The goal is to wean off the pressors with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >55 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of >75. The patient should continue with intravenous fluids, aim for urine output (UOP) of >50cc/hr, and be transfused for hematocrit (HCT) <25.

2. GI bleed: The patient has known gastric varices, and there is blood in the nasogastric tube (NGT) along with coffee ground emesis, which is concerning for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is on Coumadin and imaging shows concern for GI and/or retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's HCT is improving after transfusion without evidence of active bleeding. The plan is to keep the patient NPO (nothing"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions for his conditions, including antibiotics for peritonitis, anticoagulation for a superior mesenteric vein (SMV) clot, and transfusions for anemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 73/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is awake and oriented, with good skin integrity and warm extremities. However, the patient's abdomen is distended and firm, and there is evidence of bilious fluid drainage from a nasogastric tube.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressors. This could be due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding or renal perfusion issues.

2. GI Bleed: The patient has known gastric varices and is experiencing blood in the nasogastric tube and"

 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the
   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot. Although patient had reported
   coffee ground emesis on the floor, most likely source of hypotension
   may have been RP bleed given CT findings.  Now off pressors since
   yesterday afternoon, and leg pressures have been stable with SBPs in
   the 70s and 80s.
   - Continue bp cuff on thighs for more accurate read
   - goal MAP > 55, SBP > 75
   - continue with IVF, bolus to UOP >30cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - Cipro flagyl D/cd yesterday given that cx data was negative x 48
   hours. Given history of instrumentation, will continue Vanco until
   cultures finalize
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding. Now Hct and HD
   stable with Tfts running.
   - NPO, NGT in place draining bilious fluid to suction
   - Continue protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <25
   - hold anticoagulation for now, but may consider lovenox again in the
   next 24-48 hours
   ..
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue Abx as above
   - serial abdominal exams, currently improving
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for bridging of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency. Also with RP bleed (see above)
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerate POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - start tube feeds with pancreatic enzyme replacement (tube currently
   in duodenum)
   - Hold TPN for now as patient appears to be tolerating TFs well
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Yeast in urine
   - Change foley
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues, starting TFs; replete
   electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several conditions including hypotension, retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed), sepsis without organ dysfunction, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, peritonitis, superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombus, anemia, and a seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage. It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure through appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.

2. RP Bleed: The patient's RP bleed can cause hypotension and can lead to further complications such as kidney injury or shock. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and prompt intervention are necessary.

3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction. If left untreated, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). It is crucial to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and source control measures.

4. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed may worsen and cause significant blood loss leading to hypotension and shock. Endoscopic intervention or surgery may be required to control the bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the
   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot. Although patient had reported
   coffee ground emesis on the floor, most likely source of hypotension
   may have been RP bleed given CT findings.  Now off pressors since
   yesterday afternoon, and leg pressures have been stable with SBPs in
   the 70s and 80s.
   - Continue bp cuff on thighs for more accurate read
   - goal MAP > 55, SBP > 75
   - continue with IVF, bolus to UOP >30cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - Cipro flagyl D/cd yesterday given that cx data was negative x 48
   hours. Given history of instrumentation, will continue Vanco until
   cultures finalize
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding. Now Hct and HD
   stable with Tfts running.
   - NPO, NGT in place draining bilious fluid to suction
   - Continue protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <25
   - hold anticoagulation for now, but may consider lovenox again in the
   next 24-48 hours
   ..
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue Abx as above
   - serial abdominal exams, currently improving
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for bridging of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency. Also with RP bleed (see above)
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerate POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - start tube feeds with pancreatic enzyme replacement (tube currently
   in duodenum)
   - Hold TPN for now as patient appears to be tolerating TFs well
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Yeast in urine
   - Change foley
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues, starting TFs; replete
   electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots
   # Communication: with family, mom in particular
   # Code: full, confirmed with family
   # Dispo: CALLED OUT

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications and conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive despite being off pressors since yesterday afternoon. This could be due to ongoing internal bleeding or sepsis.

2. Retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed): The patient has a history of gastric varices, and the CT findings suggest that the hypotension may have been caused by an RP bleed rather than a gastrointestinal bleed. Further monitoring is necessary to assess the patient's blood pressure and hemodynamic stability.

3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, but without any evidence of organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any deterioration in the patient's condition.

4. GI bleed: The patient has known gastric varices and presents with coffee ground emesis, which is concerning for a GI bleed. The NGT draining bilious fluid to suction indicates the presence of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. 

5. Peritonitis: Although no positive cultures were found, the patient was presumed to have peritonitis on admission and was initially treated as such. Serial abdominal exams should continue to monitor for any signs of improvement or worsening of the condition.

6. SMV thrombus: The patient has a chronic superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombus with good collaterals. The patient was on lovenox for"

   - goal MAP > 55, SBP > 75
   - continue with IVF, bolus to UOP >30cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - Cipro flagyl D/cd yesterday given that cx data was negative x 48
   hours. Given history of instrumentation, will continue Vanco until
   cultures finalize
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto

   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding. Now Hct and HD
   stable with Tfts running.
   - NPO, NGT in place draining bilious fluid to suction
   - Change IV protonix to lansoprazole per NGT
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <25
   - hold anticoagulation for now
   - Revisit anticoagulation issue at a later time (perhaps d/w liver)
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for bridging of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency. Also with RP bleed (see above)
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerate POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - start tube feeds with pancreatic enzyme replacement (tube currently
   in duodenum)
   - Hold TPN for now as patient appears to be tolerating TFs well
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Yeast in urine
   - Change foley
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues, starting TFs; replete
   electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots
   # Communication: with family, mom in particular
   # Code: full, confirmed with family
   # Dispo: CALLED OUT

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypotension, retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and possible gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been on anticoagulation therapy for a Superior Mesenteric Vein (SMV) clot and is now experiencing a GI bleed. He has received transfusions for anemia and is being managed for his seizure disorder and cerebral palsy. The patient also has yeast in his urine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to the RP bleed and anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions, such as fluid administration or vasopressors, will be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient's RP bleed requires close monitoring, and interventions such as blood product transfusion may be necessary. Further evaluation, such as imaging studies, may be required to assess the extent of the bleed.
3. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to the GI bleed. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status. Prompt identification and treatment"
