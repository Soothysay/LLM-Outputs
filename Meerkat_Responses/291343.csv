","The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU for management of dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory distress, which may be caused by worsening hydrothorax, pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonitis. The chest X-ray shows worsening right opacification.

The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, for which vancomycin was initiated during hemodialysis (HD) and will be completed in a 14-day course on [**2131-2-3**]. Ceftriaxone was discontinued as there was no evidence of ongoing gram-negative infection based on culture data.

The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and worsening in the setting of sepsis. Antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia should be continued, and further antibiotics should be held and dosed according to fevers or other signs of infection. Lactulose should be titrated to [**3-12**] BM/day, and rifaximin may be considered if there is no improvement in [**1-11**] days with the above treatment.

The patient's Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is 28 on [**2131-12-25**]. Pre-transplant workup, including hepatitis B and C viral serologies"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/57 to 95/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH at 7.36, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 48 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 121 mEq/L, base excess at -25 mEq/L, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) at 202, and respiratory rate (RR) set at 10 breaths per minute.

The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a dialysis catheter, arterial line, and central venous pressure (CVP) line. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 17.4 K/uL, decreased hematocrit (Hct) at 34.0%, platelet count of 117, creatinine (Cr) level of 3.1 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 27, blood glucose level of 88 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, and piperacillin. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and potential worsening of sepsis. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition is essential to prevent and manage these complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred from OSH for management of dyspnea and consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant.
- The patient was intubated urgently due to respiratory distress, possibly caused by worsening hydrothorax, pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonitis.
- The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin during HD. Ceftriaxone has been discontinued as there is no evidence of ongoing gram-negative infection based on culture data.
- The patient is experiencing altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and worsening sepsis.
- The patient has end-stage liver disease (ESLD) with a most recent MELD score of 28.
- The patient also has renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following surgery on [**11-16**].
- The patient has a history of recent weight loss and poor oral intake.
- The patient has multiple lines, including a dialysis catheter, arterial line, and PIV.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, recurrent infections, hepatic encephalopathy, liver and kidney failure, and malnutrition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of renal failure (ESRD), impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal limits but slightly low blood pressure and respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is at 96%, indicating adequate oxygenation. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is low, suggesting possible fluid depletion or poor cardiac output.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine for hemodynamic support. They are also receiving antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam) and other ICU medications such as dextrose.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,085 mL with an output of 0 mL, indicating fluid overload. The respiratory support shows the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. The blood culture results from previous days show positive growth, indicating an ongoing"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M with presumed EtOH cirrhosis transferred from OSH for management of
   dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver -
   kidney transplant transferred to the MICU following increased
   respiratory distress during HD
   .
   1. Respiratory distress:  Secondary to sepsis and right sided
   effusion.  Currently on mechanical ventilation.  Will attempt to wean
   as tolerated, however sedation discontinues this AM and the patient has
   not aroused.
   - Treat line sepsis as below
   - Consider tapping hydrothorax in the future, though likely to recur
   quickly
   - Echo with bubble study done yesterday did not show obvious cause of
   respiratory distress
   .
   2. Hypotension:  Likely secondary to septic shock.
   - Continue vancomycin, dosed by level, and continue zosyn
   - Removed HD line yesterday.  Left sided IJ will need to be pulled once
   infection has cleared
   - Continue daily blood cultures, follow other cultures.  Attempt to get
   more culture information from OSH
   - Fluid resuscitate CVP 8-12
   - target MAP >65
   - Will get TEE to rule out endocarditis
   .
   3. Confusion
   Likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well
   as hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Treating infection as above
   - Continue lactulose
   .
   4. Cirrhosis
   - Holding diuretics and beta blockers in setting of hypotension
   - Transplant workup per hepatology
   - f/u liver recommendations
   .
   5. Renal failure thought sequelae of ATN post surgery [**11-16**]
   - Per Renal will start CVVH through temporary HD catheter
   - Renal transplant eval if stabilized and returns to medical floor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis, who was transferred to the ICU for management of dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. He was transferred from the CCU to the MICU due to increased respiratory distress during hemodialysis. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. He is experiencing respiratory distress secondary to sepsis and right-sided effusion, hypotension likely secondary to septic shock, confusion likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia and hepatic encephalopathy, and renal failure thought to be sequelae of acute tubular necrosis post surgery. The patient has impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if the underlying cause, such as sepsis and right-sided effusion, is not effectively treated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may persist or worsen if the septic shock is not appropriately managed.
3. Confusion: The patient's confusion may continue or worsen if the current infection and other contributing factors are not addressed.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may progress if the underlying cause, such as acute tubular necrosis, is not managed"

   65M with presumed EtOH cirrhosis transferred from OSH for management of
   dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver -
   kidney transplant transferred to the MICU following increased
   respiratory distress during HD
   .
   1. Respiratory distress
   The acute precipitant for his respiratory distress is uncertain -
   consider ARDS in the setting of his sepsis. ?Whether fluid shift during
   HD may have been an issue. An aspiration event is also a possibility.
   MI or PE seem less likely. Of note, his pulmonary reserve is very
   limited by his increasing right sided pleural effusion and his
   distended abdomen. Unknown whether he has pulmonary shunts.
   - Treat ?line sepsis as below
   - Consider tapping hydrothorax, though likely to recur quickly
   - Followup pleural fluid labs from outside hospital
   - Echo with bubble study
   .
   2. Hypotension
   BP initially stable on ICU transfer, then hypotensive to 80's
   responding to fluids and levophed. Most likely septic shock. Use of HD
   catheter today may have resulted in bacteremia setting off septic
   response.
   - Continue vancomycin, will add zosyn given acuity of decompensation
   and recent hospitalization allowing for possibility of gram negative
   infection
   - Remove lines from outside facility as soon as alternative HD access
   can be secured. Place new triple lumen HD catheter today
   - Culture blood/sputum/urine
   - Fluid resuscitate CVP 8-12
   - target MAP >65
   .
   3. Confusion
   Likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well
   as hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Treating infection as above
   - Continue lactulose
   .
   4. Cirrhosis
   - Holding diuretics and beta blockers in setting of hypotension
   - Transplant workup per hepatology
   - f/u liver recommendations
   .
   5. Renal failure thought sequelae of ATN post surgery [**11-16**]
   - Discuss CVVH with renal if pressures remain tenuous
   - Renal transplant eval if stabilized and returns to medical floor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis. He was transferred to the MICU for management of dyspnea and consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient's respiratory distress is acute and its precipitant is uncertain. It may be due to ARDS in the setting of sepsis or aspiration. There is also a possibility of pulmonary shunts. The patient's pulmonary reserve is limited due to increasing right-sided pleural effusion and distended abdomen.

The patient's blood pressure initially was stable but then became hypotensive in the 80s, responding to fluids and levophed. This suggests septic shock. The use of the HD catheter today may have resulted in bacteremia setting off the septic response.

The patient has confusion likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's cirrhosis requires holding diuretics and beta blockers in the setting of hypotension. Transplant workup per hepatology should be done, along with follow-up liver recommendations.

The patient's renal failure is thought to be a sequelae of ATN post surgery. CVVH with renal should be discussed if pressures remain tenuous, and renal transplant evaluation should be considered if the patient stabilizes and returns to the medical floor.

- The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed due to being intubated and sedated.
- The patient's medical history includes ESRD, impaired skin integrity, ARDS, and sepsis.
- The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.
- The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Piperacillin on 01/24/2132 at 08:00 AM and Zosyn on 01/26/2132 at 02:00 AM.
- The patient's current medications include calcium gluconate for CRRT, norepinephrine, KCl for CRRT, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently receiving antibiotics. There is a risk of developing further infections due to the presence of multiple lines and tubes.
2. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance indicates that the patient may be at risk for fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory distress.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is undergoing CVVH. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. ARDS: The patient has a history of ARDS, and the current respiratory support indicates ongoing respiratory distress. There is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of presumed EtOH cirrhosis, who was transferred from OSH for management of dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. He was admitted to the MICU following increased respiratory distress during HD. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with respiratory distress secondary to sepsis and right-sided effusion, hypotension likely secondary to septic shock, confusion likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well as hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis, and renal failure thought sequelae of ATN post surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS or worsening sepsis.
2. Hypotension and septic shock leading to organ dysfunction.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy and worsening confusion.
4. Impaired skin integrity due to immobility and possible pressure ulcers.
5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) and continued renal failure.
6. Potential complications related to the planned liver-kidney transplant.

The patient's current condition is critical, and there are multiple potential medical complications that could arise. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory function, renal function, and liver function. Prompt treatment of sepsis and management of fluid balance, electrolytes, and nutrition are essential. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of presumed EtOH cirrhosis. He was transferred to the MICU for management of dyspnea and consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, hypotension, confusion, and renal failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving treatment for sepsis. The patient also has impaired skin integrity and is undergoing CVVH for renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be secondary to sepsis and a right-sided effusion. Mechanical ventilation is currently being used, and weaning may be attempted as tolerated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock. Treatment includes continuing vancomycin and zosyn, removing the HD line, pulling the left-sided IJ once the infection clears, and fluid resuscitation with a target CVP of 8-12 and MAP >65.
3. Confusion: The patient's confusion is likely secondary to the current infection, exacerbated by hypoxia and hepatic encephalopathy. Treating the infection and continuing lactulose can help manage this condition.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, and diuretics and beta-blockers are being withheld due to hypotension. A transplant workup per hepatology is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been experiencing loose stools, likely due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. There have been attempts to clear a clotted CVVH line and monitor fluid balance. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/59 to 128/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and other parameters within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and renal function. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 106 and 124 mg/dL. Imaging reveals changes in lung expansion, consistent with previous findings.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has loose stools indicating a possible C. diff infection. There is also a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M with presumed EtOH cirrhosis transferred from OSH for management of
   dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver -
   kidney transplant transferred to the MICU following increased
   respiratory distress during HD.
   1. Respiratory distress:  Secondary to sepsis and right sided
   effusion.  Currently on mechanical ventilation.  Will attempt to wean
   as tolerated, however sedation discontinues this AM and the patient has
   not aroused.
   - Treat line sepsis as below
   - Consider tapping hydrothorax in the future, though likely to recur
   quickly
   - Echo with bubble study on 1/ 15 did not show obvious cause of
   respiratory distress
   2. Hypotension:  Likely secondary to septic shock.  Currently on
   Levophed
   - Continue vancomycin, dosed by level, and continue zosyn
   - Removed HD line yesterday.  Left sided IJ will need to be pulled once
   infection has cleared
   - Continue daily blood cultures, follow other cultures.  Attempt to get
   more culture information from OSH
   3. Renal failure thought sequelae of ATN post surgery [**11-16**]
   - Per Renal will start CVVH through temporary HD catheter
   - Renal transplant eval if stabilized and returns to medical floor
   #. Ileus: Large stomach residuals
   - Reglan
   - Hold TF
   4. Altered mental Status
   Likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well
   as hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Treating infection as above
   - Continue lactulose
   5. Cirrhosis
   - Holding diuretics and beta blockers in setting of hypotension
   - Transplant workup per hepatology
   - f/u liver recommendations
   FEN/GI: TF, replete lytes as needed
   Proph: pneumoboots, PPI

The patient's current health issues include respiratory distress, hypotension, renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of presumed EtOH cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for management of dyspnea and consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient was transferred from another hospital due to increased respiratory distress during hemodialysis. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress secondary to sepsis and right-sided effusion, hypotension likely due to septic shock, renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, and cirrhosis. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to increased respiratory distress. There is a plan to attempt weaning as tolerated, but the patient has not aroused since sedation was discontinued.
2. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, and is currently on norepinephrine (Levophed). The treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin and zosyn, as well as daily blood cultures.
3. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure thought to be a sequelae of acute tubular necrosis post-surgery. CVVH through a temporary HD catheter will be started, and renal transplant evaluation will be considered if the patient stabilizes and returns to the medical floor.
4. Ileus: The patient has large stomach residuals, indicating ileus. Reglan has been started, and the team is holding tube feeding (TF) and rechecking residuals this"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of presumed ethanol cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU for management of dyspnea and consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and right-sided effusion. He is also experiencing hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock, and renal failure thought to be a sequelae of acute tubular necrosis post-surgery. Other issues include ileus, altered mental status, cirrhosis, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is receiving treatment for infection, including antibiotics and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). Additionally, he is being treated for altered mental status with lactulose and has been placed on a full code status. The patient's family has been informed, and a full code meeting is scheduled for today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is an inability to wean off mechanical ventilation or if the underlying cause of the hypoxia is not adequately addressed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to further organ dysfunction or failure if not properly managed and treated. This includes the potential for septic shock to progress and affect other organ systems.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may continue"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of diarrhea. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and altered nutrition. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 35.2 C (95.3 F)
- Heart rate: 109 bpm
- Blood pressure: 98/65 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 50%

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, potassium chloride (CRRT), pantoprazole, fentanyl, and midazolam. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, low platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium, low magnesium, and high phosphorus. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes and abnormal blood gases. 

Imaging shows an ET tube in place and no significant change in right hydrothorax. The patient tested negative for Clostridium difficile infection. 

The patient's arterial blood gas values are:
- pH: 7.37
- PaCO2: 34 mmHg
- PaO2: 186 mmHg
- HCO3: 18 mEq/L
- Base excess: -4
- SatO2: 100%
- Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 74.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, and there is a possibility of worsening infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS, and there is a risk of further deterioration in lung function.
3. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and there is a risk of worsening renal function.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infection.
5. Malnutrition: The patient has altered nutrition and diarrhea, which can lead to malnutrition and decreased immune function.

These are some potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided. It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these complications."

   65M with presumed EtOH cirrhosis transferred from OSH for management of
   dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver -
   kidney transplant transferred to the MICU following increased
   respiratory distress during HD.
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to sepsis and right sided
   effusion.  Currently on mechanical ventilation.
   Will not attempt to wean today given worsening hypotension and clinical
   status.   Discontinued sedation given hypotension, may need to give
   small bolus if poor vent compliance
   - Treat line sepsis
   #.  Hypotension:  Worsening overnight, had to discontinue CVVH, mildly
   fluid responsive.   Likely secondary to septic shock.  Currently maxed
   out on Levophed, will add Vasopressin today
   - Continue vancomycin, dosed by level, and continue zosyn, consider
   broadening coverage
   - Continue daily blood cultures, follow other cultures, but no growth
   to date here.
   - Paracentesis yesterday did not show evidence of SBP
   - Plan for TEE today if more stable
   #. Renal failure:  thought sequelae of ATN post surgery [**11-16**]
   - The patient was on CVVH, however discontinued last night after
   difficulties with anticoagulation, flow rate and hypotension
   - Will check second set of lytes this AM and replete as needed
   - no longer a transplant candidate
   .
   #. Ileus: Large stomach residuals.  Likely secondary to bowel wall
   edema
   - Continue Reglan
   - TF held this AM, will attempt to restart today
   - Consider KUB later today if not improving
   #. Altered mental Status
   Likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well
   as hepatic encephalopathy and sedation.
   - Treating infection as above
   - Continue lactulose
   #. Cirrhosis
   - Holding diuretics and beta blockers in setting of hypotension
   - No longer transplant candidate at this time
   - f/u liver recommendations
   FEN/GI: Hold TF, replete lytes as needed through CVVH

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis and renal failure. He was admitted to the MICU for management of dyspnea and evaluation for combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient's condition has deteriorated overnight, with worsening hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to sepsis and right-sided effusion. The patient's hypotension is thought to be due to septic shock, and he is maxed out on Levophed. Vasopressin will be added today.

The patient has also been diagnosed with renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, and cirrhosis. He underwent a diagnostic paracentesis yesterday, which did not show evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's renal failure is thought to be a sequelae of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) post-surgery.

Plan:
1. Treat line sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Continue vancomycin, dosed by level, and continue Zosyn, considering broadening coverage.
3. Discontinue CVVH due to difficulties with anticoagulation, flow rate, and hypotension.
4. Check second set of labs this morning and replete as needed.
5. Hold diuretics and beta blockers in the setting of"

   65M with presumed EtOH cirrhosis transferred from OSH for management of
   dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver -
   kidney transplant transferred to the MICU following increased
   respiratory distress during HD.
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to sepsis and right sided
   effusion.  Currently on mechanical ventilation.  Will attempt to wean
   as tolerated, however sedation discontinues this AM and the patient has
   not aroused.
   - Treat line sepsis
   2. Hypotension:  Likely secondary to septic shock.  Currently on
   Levophed
   - Continue vancomycin, dosed by level, and continue zosyn
   - Continue daily blood cultures, follow other cultures.
   3. Renal failure thought sequelae of ATN post surgery [**11-16**]
   - Per Renal will start CVVH through temporary HD catheter
   - Renal transplant eval if stabilized and returns to medical floor
   #. Ileus: Large stomach residuals.
   - Reglan
   - Hold TF and recheck residuals this afternoon
   - Diagonstic paracentesis today with U/S
   - Possible KUB after paracentesis
   - Amylase/Lipase
   4. Altered mental Status
   Likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well
   as hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Treating infection as above
   - Continue lactulose

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of presumed EtOH cirrhosis, who was transferred to the MICU for management of dyspnea and consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and right-sided effusion, hypotension likely due to septic shock, renal failure thought to be sequelae of ATN post-surgery, ileus with large stomach residuals, altered mental status likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia and hepatic encephalopathy, and cirrhosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation may indicate the need for continued mechanical ventilation. Weaning off sedation may be challenging if the patient does not arouse.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure suggests septic shock. Pressor support with medications such as Levophed may be necessary. Infection control measures should continue, including vancomycin and Zosyn dosed by level, and daily blood cultures.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following surgery. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) through a temporary HD catheter has been initiated. If the patient stabilizes and returns to the medical floor, a renal transplant evaluation may be considered.
4. Ileus: The patient"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the hospital with complaints of altered mental status, generalized weakness, and shortness of breath. Upon admission, he was found to be hypotensive, tachycardic, and hypoxic with a respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute due to mechanical ventilation.

Initial laboratory results showed an elevated blood glucose level of 155 mg/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 78 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels indicating renal dysfunction, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis without organ dysfunction. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected MRSA infection. 

During the course of his ICU stay, the patient's condition remained unstable with fluctuating blood pressures, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. He required increasing doses of vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure and had episodes of hypoxemia that required an FiO2 of 60%. The patient's renal function continued to deteriorate, necessitating renal replacement therapy.

   respiratory distress during HD.
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to sepsis and right sided
   effusion.  Currently on mechanical ventilation.
   Will not attempt to wean today given worsening hypotension and clinical
   status.   Discontinued sedation given hypotension, may need to give
   small bolus if poor vent compliance
   - Treat line sepsis
   #.  Hypotension:  Worsening overnight, had to discontinue CVVH, mildly
   fluid responsive.   Likely secondary to septic shock.  Currently maxed
   out on Levophed, will add Vasopressin today
   - Continue vancomycin, dosed by level, and continue zosyn, consider
   broadening coverage
   - Continue daily blood cultures, follow other cultures, but no growth
   to date here.
   - Paracentesis yesterday did not show evidence of SBP
   - Plan for TEE today if more stable
   #. Renal failure:  thought sequelae of ATN post surgery [**11-16**]
   - The patient was on CVVH, however discontinued last night after
   difficulties with anticoagulation, flow rate and hypotension
   - Will check second set of lytes this AM and replete as needed
   - no longer a transplant candidate
   .
   #. Ileus: Large stomach residuals.  Likely secondary to bowel wall
   edema
   - Continue Reglan
   - TF held this AM, will attempt to restart today
   - Consider KUB later today if not improving
   #. Altered mental Status
   Likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well
   as hepatic encephalopathy and sedation.
   - Treating infection as above
   - Continue lactulose

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was transferred to the MICU for dyspnea and an expedited workup for consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient developed increased respiratory distress during hemodialysis (HD) and was intubated on mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events:
1. Paracentesis was performed, but unable to do therapeutic tap, no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
2. Nasal swab tested positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
3. The patient was not tolerating the vent well, so fentanyl and midazolam drips were restarted overnight, with plans to wean in the morning.
4. Calcium level increased to 11, and renal contacts were made to change from citrate to heparin.
5. The patient's blood pressure dropped overnight to mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s, and he became tachycardic. Temperature could not be obtained. Continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) was temporarily stopped, and pressors were increased. Sedation was stopped, and a 250cc fluid bolus was given. The patient's blood pressure stabilized after the bolus.
6. Arterial blood gas (ABG) after stopping CVV"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis. He was transferred to the ICU for management of dyspnea and an expedited workup for consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, and cirrhosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to secondary sepsis and right-sided effusion. Weaning from the ventilator may be difficult given the worsening hypotension and clinical status.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is worsening and likely secondary to septic shock. Despite being maxed out on Levophed, the patient may need to add Norepi today.

3. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure, which could be a sequelae of ATN post surgery. CVVH was discontinued last night due to difficulties with anticoagulation, flow rate, and hypotension.

4. Ileus: The patient has large stomach residuals, likely secondary to bowel wall edema. This can lead to further complications such as infection or malnutrition.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis. He was transferred to the MICU for management of dyspnea and consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing secondary hypoxia due to sepsis and right-sided effusion. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal sedation.
   - Treatment plan: Treat line sepsis, trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) today.

2. Hypotension: The patient is still on levophed and vasopressin, with less labile blood pressure today.
   - Treatment plan: Continue vancomycin and zosyn, consider broadening coverage.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has dropped significantly overnight, and he received a transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBC). This could be due to hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with possible gastrointestinal losses indicated by guaiac positive stool. Fibrinogen level is low.
   - Treatment plan: Finish PRBC transfusion, repeat Hct every 4 hours, cryoprecipitate x1, recheck fibrinogen, coags, and platelets in PM.

4. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing sequelae of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) post-surgery.
   - Treatment plan: No acute indication for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) today. Check second set of electrolytes this morning and replete as needed. No longer a transplant candidate.

5. Ileus: The patient has large stomach residuals, likely secondary to bowel wall edema.
   - Treatment plan: Continue reglan, restart tube feeding (TF), consider post-pyloric feeding tube.

6. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well as hepatic encephalopathy and sedation.
   - Treatment plan: Treating infection as above, continue lactulose.

7. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis.
   - Treatment plan: Holding diuretics and beta blockers in setting of hypotension. No longer transplant candidate at this time.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed.

3. Bleeding: The patient's low fibrinogen level and hemolysis indicate an increased risk of bleeding.

4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is already compromised, and further deterioration could occur if not managed appropriately.

5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be exacerbated by hepatic encephalopathy.

6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac positive stool suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be due to varices or other causes.

7. Hepatitis: The patient's liver disease puts him at risk for hepatitis infections.

8. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver disease and renal failure increase the risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome.

9. Sepsis: The patient's current infection may progress to sepsis if not effectively treated.

10. Multiorgan failure: The patient's compromised organ function, including liver, kidneys, and respiratory system, increases the risk of multiorgan failure.

The patient requires close monitoring and prompt management of these potential complications to improve his health progress in the ICU."

   65M with presumed EtOH cirrhosis transferred from OSH for management of
   dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver -
   kidney transplant transferred to the MICU following increased
   respiratory distress during HD.
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to sepsis and right sided
   effusion.  Currently on mechanical ventilation.
   Will not attempt to wean today given worsening hypotension and clinical
   status.   Discontinued sedation given hypotension, may need to give
   small bolus if poor vent compliance
   - Treat line sepsis
   #.  Hypotension:  Worsening overnight, had to discontinue CVVH, mildly
   fluid responsive.   Likely secondary to septic shock.  Currently maxed
   out on Levophed, will add Vasopressin today
   - Continue vancomycin, dosed by level, and continue zosyn, consider
   broadening coverage
   - Continue daily blood cultures, follow other cultures, but no growth
   to date here.
   - Paracentesis yesterday did not show evidence of SBP
   - Plan for TEE today if more stable
   #. Anemia: Hct drop of 7 points overnight, transfused 1 unit PRBC.  No
   clear etiology
   -          T&S
   #. Renal failure:  thought sequelae of ATN post surgery [**11-16**]
   - The patient was on CVVH, however discontinued last night after
   difficulties with anticoagulation, flow rate and hypotension
   - Will check second set of lytes this AM and replete as needed
   - no longer a transplant candidate
   .
   #. Ileus: Large stomach residuals.  Likely secondary to bowel wall
   edema
   - Continue Reglan
   - TF held this AM, will attempt to restart today
   - Consider KUB later today if not improving
   #. Altered mental Status
   Likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well
   as hepatic encephalopathy and sedation.
   - Treating infection as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for management of dyspnea and consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and right-sided effusion. The patient's hypotension worsened overnight, leading to the discontinuation of CVVH, and he is now being treated with vasopressin. The patient has anemia, renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to sepsis and right-sided effusion. Continued management and treatment of sepsis are necessary, along with consideration of further interventions such as a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) if the patient's condition stabilizes.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has worsened overnight, likely due to septic shock. Treatment with vasopressin has been initiated, and further evaluation of the cause of hypotension is needed.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct drop of 7 points overnight indicates significant anemia. A transfusion of 1 unit PRBC has been given, and the cause of anemia needs to be investigated further.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and CVV"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

The patient has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and altered nutrition with diarrhea. 

Vital signs show a blood pressure of 131/62 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to hemodynamic instability, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. 

The patient has received various medications including vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, and antibiotics such as vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 66,000/mm3, creatinine (Cr) of 2.0 mg/dL, total CO2 (TCO2) of 25 mmHg, glucose of 103 mg/dL, and various other abnormalities in electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests. Imaging shows a large pleural effusion and ascites, and microbiology tests are pending.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, progression of renal failure, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and further gastrointestinal issues related to altered nutrition and diarrhea. It is crucial to optimize respiratory support, maintain adequate fluid balance, manage antibiotic therapy, and address any electrolyte or metabolic disturbances."

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and heart rate. His oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, indicating potential fluid overload. He is receiving vasopressin, norepinephrine, and fentanyl infusions to support his blood pressure and comfort. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. He has heme-positive stool, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's heme-positive stool indicates active bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to further deterioration in his hemodynamic status and may require urgent endoscopic intervention.
2. Septic shock: Despite being on two pressors, the patient remains in septic shock, suggesting an ongoing infection. Identifying the source of infection is crucial to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging. Close monitoring and titration of ventilator settings are necessary.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates impaired renal function. Monitoring fluid balance, avoiding nephro"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old man with cirrhosis, septic shock, renal failure, and respiratory failure. He has experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration and hematemesis overnight. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple vasopressors for hemodynamic support.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 127/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 60%. His central venous pressure is 13 mmHg, and he has received a total of 3,732 mL of fluids since midnight with a balance of 2,619 mL. He is receiving vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, and norepinephrine infusions.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the right side, soft non-tender distended abdomen, warm extremities, and no neurologic assessment due to his altered mental status. His arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 75 mmHg, and HCO3- of 22 mEq/L. His laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 66 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, hypoalbuminemia with an albumin level of 2.0 g/dL, and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation with schistocytes on smear.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, altered mental status, septic shock, anemia, chronic renal failure, and coagulopathy. The plan includes trying to wean the patient off mechanical ventilation, addressing goals of care, transfusing cryoprecipitate and platelets as needed, and providing ICU care such as nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   -          Family meeting today to adjust plan
   #.  Hypotension:  Requiring greater amounts of Levophed & Vasopressin
   - Hold vancomycin and continue zosyn, consider broadening coverage
   - Continue daily blood cultures, follow other cultures, but no growth
   to date here.
   - Family meeting today to adjust plan
   #. Anemia: Hct stable after transfusion.
   -          [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   #. Renal failure:  thought sequelae of ATN post surgery [**11-16**].
   -          Family meeting today to adjust plan
   - No acute indication for CVVH today
   - PM Lytes
   - no longer a transplant candidate
   #. Ileus: Large stomach residuals.  Likely secondary to bowel wall
   edema
   - Continue Reglan
   - TF held this AM, Family meeting today to adjust plan, possible
   post-pyloric feeding tube
   #. Altered mental Status
   Likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well
   as hepatic encephalopathy and sedation.
   - Treating infection as above
   - Continue lactulose
   #. Cirrhosis
   - Holding diuretics and beta blockers in setting of hypotension
   - No longer transplant candidate at this time

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for management of dyspnea and evaluation for combined liver-kidney transplant. He was transferred from another hospital due to increased respiratory distress during hemodialysis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and did not tolerate elevated PEEP overnight. He requires increased amounts of pressor support and has a history of anemia, renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, and cirrhosis. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening hypotension and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing secondary hypoxic respiratory failure due to sepsis and right-sided effusion. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there was an issue with tolerating elevated PEEP overnight. The treatment plan includes increasing FiO2, not PEEP, and considering a family meeting to adjust the plan.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension requires greater amounts of Levophed & Vasopressin. The plan involves holding vancomycin and continuing zosyn, considering broadening coverage, and conducting daily blood cultures. A family meeting is scheduled to discuss the plan.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has been stable after transfusion.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is believed to have renal failure as a sequelae of ATN post-surgery. A"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for management of dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal sedation due to increased respiratory distress during HD. Treatment for line sepsis and consideration of pressure support ventilation (PSV) today are recommended.

2. Hypotension: The patient is still on Levophed & Vasopressin, indicating persistent hypotension. Continuing vancomycin, dosed by level, and continuing zosyn, with consideration of broadening coverage, is advised. Daily blood cultures should be followed, and other cultures should be monitored for any growth.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped by 7 points overnight, and a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was transfused. Hemolysis or DIC with possible GI losses, as indicated by a guaiac positive stool, could be contributing factors. Cryoprecipitate x1 should be given to replenish fibrinogen levels, and coags, plts, and Hct should be rechecked in the morning.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 89 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 90/56 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation in the assist-control mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.

The patient's laboratory values showed elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 2.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 44 K/uL, glucose at 114 mg/dL, and low levels of albumin at 2.0 g/dL. The platelet count was within normal range at 51 K/uL, but the white blood cell (WBC) count was slightly low at 7.6 K/uL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has shown worsening oxygenation requiring increased PEEP and increased pressor requirements overnight. The patient is on multiple medications including vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, and pantoprazole. His vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and heart rate. He has a distended abdomen and edema in both lower extremities. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and liver enzymes, among other abnormalities.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, as indicated by the need for increased PEEP and oxygen. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by low blood pressure and organ dysfunction. The source of infection is still unclear, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Failure to identify and treat the source of infection can lead to continued instability and potential organ failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. Without appropriate intervention, renal failure could progress and result in the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Ileus: The patient is not tolerating tube feedings"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with cirrhosis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is critical and requires close monitoring and management.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation is deteriorating, and there is an increasing requirement for PEEP. This indicates a possible worsening of the respiratory failure, which may necessitate further interventions such as mechanical ventilation adjustments or tracheostomy.

2. Septic shock: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient remains in septic shock and requires increasing doses of pressors. Identifying the source of infection is crucial to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy and source control.

3. Renal failure: The patient shows signs of renal dysfunction, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of renal replacement therapy (such as continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) may be necessary.

4. Ileus: The patient is not tolerating enteral feeds, suggesting the presence of ileus. This can be managed by attempting post-pyloric tube feeding or, if unsuccessful, considering parenteral nutrition.

5. Fluid balance and hemodynamic instability: The patient has a positive fluid balance with ongoing fluid inputs and minimal outputs. Close monitoring of fluid status and hemodynamic parameters is essential to prevent fluid overload and maintain adequate perfusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of presumed EtOH cirrhosis. He was admitted for dyspnea and is being considered for a combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient has been experiencing increased respiratory distress during hemodialysis and has now been transferred to the MICU. His condition has deteriorated, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. He also requires multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating hypotension. The patient has several other complications including anemia, renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to secondary sepsis and right-sided effusion. It is crucial to treat the underlying infection and optimize oxygen delivery while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Hypotension: The patient requires greater amounts of vasopressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may be due to sepsis or cirrhosis-related complications. Fluid resuscitation should be carefully managed considering the patient's third spacing of fluids.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable after transfusion, but further management should focus on maintaining adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has thought sequelae of ATN post-surgery. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of fluid and electrolyte balance are essential"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for dyspnea and consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient has been experiencing increased respiratory distress during hemodialysis and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and right-sided effusion. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/60 to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. 

The patient has been receiving multiple pressors, including norepinephrine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine, to maintain blood pressure. However, the blood pressure remains unstable, and the patient continues to do poorly. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, and cirrhosis. 

The plan of care includes restarting sedation for comfort, holding vancomycin due to supratherapeutic levels, continuing zosyn, following cultures, and avoiding escalation of care or resuscitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred from another hospital for management of dyspnea and consideration of combined liver-kidney transplant. The patient is currently in the MICU due to increased respiratory distress during hemodialysis. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with higher pressor requirements and decreased overall status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing secondary hypoxic respiratory failure due to sepsis and right-sided effusion. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, but did not tolerate elevated PEEP overnight.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires greater amounts of Levophed & Vasopressin to maintain blood pressure, indicating hypotension. There is also a plan to hold vancomycin and continue zosyn, considering broadening coverage for possible line sepsis.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable after transfusion.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure, possibly sequelae of ATN post-surgery. The family meeting today will adjust the plan for renal management.
5. Ileus: The patient has large stomach residuals, likely secondary to bowel wall edema. This may be causing an ileus.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well as hepatic encephalopathy and"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including renal failure, altered nutrition, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and ineffective coping. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/60 mmHg to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient has been receiving multiple vasopressors, including vasopressin, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine, to maintain adequate blood pressure. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, suggesting renal dysfunction. Other lab values are relatively stable.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a slightly low pH, normal partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and normal respiratory rate and volume (Ve).

The patient has been diagnosed with ineffective coping, alteration in nutrition, renal failure, impaired skin integrity, ARDS, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's care plan"

   Increasing pressor requirement - unlikely to survive more than a day or
   two.  Spoke with Mrs. [**Known lastname **] about this and how keeping him comfortable
   with
   more sedative medications may make his BP worse and hasten his death.
   She agrees that we should take care that his comfort is more important
   then
   maintaining his BP.   So will restart sedation and if he becomes more
   hypotensive will not worry as long as he is comfortable.

   Patient is critically ill
   Addendum:  After further discussion with wife, decision made to make
   the patient CMO.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted with respiratory failure and septic shock. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing worsening condition overnight. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/60 mmHg to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 21 cmH2O and fluid balance indicating an input of 1,064 mL and output of 200 mL since 12 AM.

The patient is on several medications, including vasopressin, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine for hemodynamic support, as well as pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the worsening condition.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 28 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 108 mmHg, oxygen consumption (Ve) of 11.1 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 180.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the right side, warm skin, and unresponsive neurologic status. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 151 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 105 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 3.7 mg/dL, glucose of 105 mg/dL, and several other abnormal values.

The patient's assessment and plan indicate an increasing pressor requirement, with the attending physician discussing the poor prognosis with the patient's wife. The decision has been made to focus on the patient's comfort, including restarting sedation, despite potential worsening of blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and further deterioration of renal function. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory values will be essential in managing these potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted with respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient's condition has been worsening overnight, and they are currently on multiple vasopressors including vasopressin, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine. The patient also has an endotracheal tube in place for respiratory support.

The vital signs indicate hypotension (blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg) and tachycardia (heart rate of 103 bpm). The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.4°C. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is at 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. The platelet count is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the right side, warm skin, and unresponsiveness with no movement or assessed tone.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's condition is critical, with an increasing requirement for vasopressors, suggesting poor organ perfusion. The family has agreed to prioritize the patient's comfort over maintaining blood pressure, and sedation will be restarted.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
