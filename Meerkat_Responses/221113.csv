","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV (CD4 count of 152) who presents with fever, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient was found unresponsive by EMS, and there is a concern for opioid overdose initially. However, the patient responded dramatically to Narcan, indicating a possible opioid overdose.

The differential diagnosis includes seizures, CNS infection, bacterial meningitis, viral meningitis, toxoplasmosis, bacterial abscess, cryptococcal infection, and CNS lymphoma. The patient has a history of seizure disorder and chronic toxo treatment but has a history of non-adherence to medications.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a predominance of lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), normal glucose levels, and negative cryptococcal antigen serology/CSF. The imaging studies include an MRI Head pending and X-ray survey pending.

The patient is currently on several medications, including pyramethamine & sulfadiazine for empiric Toxo treatment, acyclovir for viral encephalitis until HSV PCR, and outpatient Keppra for seizure disorder.

Regarding the hypoxemic respiratory failure, the patient was intubated and sedated. Bronchoscopy showed particulate matter in the right lower lobe (RLL). The differential diagnosis includes CA pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and influenza. The patient is being treated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV (CD4 count of 152) and a history of bacterial meningitis, toxoplasmosis, and seizure disorder. He was found unresponsive and initial concern for oxycodone or oxycontin overdose was raised, but negative tox screen makes it less likely. The patient responded dramatically to Narcan, indicating a possible opioid overdose. Differential diagnosis includes seizures, CNS infection, bacterial meningitis, viral meningitis, toxoplasmosis, bacterial abscess, cryptococcal infection, and CNS lymphoma. Neurology wants to perform an EEG today, and LP has been done with no concern for bacterial meningitis based on cell count. Cryptococcal antigen negative serology/CSF. The patient is currently on chronic toxo treatment, but has a history of non-adherence to medications.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: O2 sat down to 73% in ED. Differential includes CA pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, influenza. CXR not consistent with PCP. Bronchoscopy showed particulate matter in RLL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV on HAART therapy, who presents with fever, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. He has a history of bacterial meningitis, toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, and was found unresponsive by EMS. The initial concern for oxycodone or oxycontin overdose was ruled out after a negative tox screen. The patient responded dramatically to Narcan, indicating a potential opioid overdose. However, other differentials include seizures and CNS infection due to his history of seizure disorder and HIV status. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.5 K/uL, elevated lactate acid level, elevated troponin T levels, and decreased platelet count. Imaging studies such as MRI Head and X-ray survey are pending. Cryptococcal antigen serology and CSF tests were negative. 

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, receiving mechanical ventilation with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5 cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 84/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's condition is complex and requires further evaluation and management. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial meningitis, viral"

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo M with HIV (CD4 152) on HAART, history of bacterial meningitis,

   # Altered Mental Status
      Major etiologies include drug effect, CNS infection, CNS lesion,
   status epilepticus/seizure, hypoxic injury in context of earlier drug
   intoxication, delirium secondary to other infection or compound of
   ADC/past neurologic injury with decreased reserve in context of
   infection. To this end we have examined drug interactions, held most
   psychotropics, perfomed CT and MRI, EEG and have investigated
   underlying infections and are treating pneumonia.
      Drug effect is likely given numerous psychotropic medications in
   context of very long medication list with unclear metabolic
   consequences. Temporally linked to restarting baclofen. Naloxone was
   effective initiall, but given patient on opioids may have non-specific
   arousing effect. Reserve may also be decreased given previous
   toxoplasmosis lesion including parabrachial nucleus, cuneiform area and
   posterolateral hypothalamus on the left - regions that are implicated
   for driving wakefulness. This lesion appears to be stable and he has
   clearly recovered cortical function after the original presentation,
   but this may result in decreased 'reserve', although this is
   speculative. Underlying pneumonia is another possible contributor.
   Other CNS infections are possible, but less likely given negative
   workup so far and bland CSF. Seizure does not appear likely in view of
   presentation and fluctuation, but EEG may not be helpful in context of
   fentanyl and Versed being given at that time. Possible secondary to
   hypoxemia in context of underlying pneumonia, although less likely.
   Given CD4+ last 150, other differentials need to be consdiered:
   mycobacteria, cryptococcus, listeria, primary CNS lymphoma, VZV and HSV
   encephalitis - all seem less likely now, but will follow studies for
   these.
   - Continue outpatient Keppra
   - Follow mental status - expect to clear given Rx of pneumonia and
   holding psychotropics
   - Minimize and use single [**Doctor Last Name **] sedation (with Versed)
   - F/u Neurology and ID recs
   - Treat underlying pneumonia
   - F/u lab results for infection and flu
   # Hypoxemic Repiratory Failure
      Likely secondary to CNS depression and pneumonia (chemical versus
   bacteria), possible excess of sedating medications/psychotropcs. Flu
   unlikely. O2 sat down to 73% in ED. CXR not consistent with PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] intubated and sedated. Bronchoscopy showed particulate matter
   in RLL.
   - Continue ceftrizxone/flagyl for aspiration and azithromycin for CAP
   - Stop tamiflu/precautions when negative flu official :)
   - F/u BAL cultures, legionella

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV, presenting with unresponsiveness, hypopnea, and respiratory distress. He has a history of toxoplasmosis, seizures, and bacterial meningitis. The patient was found by EMS in respiratory distress and was intubated in the emergency department. A CT scan showed a left cerebellar lesion with edema, which appears unchanged since [**2134**]. A chest X-ray revealed a dense right infiltrate and volume loss, indicating pneumonia. The patient is suspected to have toxicity from numerous psychotropic medications and possible toxicity of baclofen.

24-hour events:
- EEG at [**2136-1-28**] 09:15 AM
- EKG at [**2136-1-28**] 11:30 AM
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at [**2136-1-28**] 10:45 PM
- Episodes of bradycardia/hypotension/unresponsiveness with HR ~ 50 and SBP ~ 80
- When aroused would typically have rate ~ 90 and SBP in 120s
- Slightly agitated when aroused and needing restraints
- Spoke to wife who thinks restarting baclofen this week may have been the cause
- Just Versed for sedation last night and this a.m.

   # Altered Mental Status
      Major etiologies include drug effect, CNS infection, CNS lesion,
   status epilepticus/seizure, hypoxic injury in context of earlier drug
   intoxication, delirium secondary to other infection or compound of
   ADC/past neurologic injury with decreased reserve in context of
   infection. To this end we have examined drug interactions, held most
   psychotropics, perfomed CT and MRI, EEG and have investigated
   underlying infections and are treating pneumonia.
      HIV is important consideration for differential diagnosis. CD4 count
   on [**2135-12-2**] was 100 per uL and VL 79,000 copies/mL. Given rapid
   fluctuations and poor compliance previously, this may not represent
   present level. Primary CNS lymphoma unlikely given CSF, but await signs
   of leptomeningeal enhancement/infiltration on MRI. Cryptococcus CSF and
   blood negative.
      CSF is bland except for high protein (76
 near double upper limit
   of normal). C/w viral meningitis and possibly mycobacterial if CD4
   count is low. Will await CD4 count and VL along with laboratory
   results. HTLV, HSV, VZV still possible although latter two might show
   in MRI also.
      Drug effect is likely given numerous psychotropic medications in
   context of very long medication list with unclear metabolic
   consequences. Temporally linked to restarting baclofen. Naloxone was
   effective initiall, but given patient on opioids may have non-specific
   arousing effect. Reserve may also be decreased given previous
   toxoplasmosis lesion including parabrachial nucleus, cuneiform area and
   posterolateral hypothalamus on the left - regions that are implicated
   for driving wakefulness. This lesion appears to be stable and he has
   clearly recovered cortical function after the original presentation,
   but this may result in decreased 'reserve', although this is
   speculative. Underlying pneumonia is another possible contributor.
   Other CNS infections are possible, but less likely given negative
   workup so far and bland CSF. Seizure does not appear likely in view of
   presentation and fluctuation, but EEG may not be helpful in context of
   fentanyl and Versed being given at that time. Possible secondary to
   hypoxemia in context of underlying pneumonia, although less likely.
   - Continue outpatient Keppra
   - Add-on PCR for HSV/VZV, consider HTLV later
   - Follow mental status - expect to clear given Rx of pneumonia and
   holding psychotropics
   - Minimize and use single [**Doctor Last Name **] sedation (with Versed)
   - F/u Neurology and ID recs
   - Await final MRI read
   - HIV - CD4 and VL
   - Treat underlying pneumonia
   - F/u lab results for infection and flu
   # Hypoxemic Repiratory Failure
      Likely secondary to CNS depression and pneumonia (chemical versus
   bacteria), possible excess of sedating medications/psychotropcs. Flu
   unlikely. O2 sat down to 73% in ED. CXR not consistent with PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] intubated and sedated. Bronchoscopy showed particulate matter
   in RLL.
   - Continue ceftrizxone/flagyl for aspiration and azithromycin for CAP
   - Stop tamiflu and precautions now antigen back
   - F/u BAL cultures, legionella
   - Minimize sedation as above
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   # Erythematous Lesion with Vesicle
   Unclear etiology. Vesicular lesion concerning for HSV versus bacterial.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be contact dermatitis. Unlikely bacteria in view of negative Gram
   stain. Await viral culture results.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV (CD4 count of 100 and viral load of 79,000 on [**2135-12-2**]) who presented with unresponsiveness and hypopnea at home. He has a past medical history of toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, and bacterial meningitis. The patient was found in respiratory distress by EMS and intubated in the emergency department. Lesions on CT and MRI are unchanged. The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, possible toxicity from numerous psychotropic medications, poor compliance with medication, and worsened HIV with CNS infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is comatose with no spontaneous movement, lordosis of the neck, and minimal muscle movement in the affected limb. The altered mental status could be due to drug effect, CNS infection, CNS lesion, status epilepticus/seizure, hypoxic injury in the context of earlier drug intoxication, delirium secondary to other infection, or decreased reserve in the context of infection.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure secondary to CNS depression and pneumonia. There is a possibility of excess sedating medications/psychotropics contributing to this condition. The patient's oxygen saturation was down to 73% in the emergency department, indicating severe hypoxemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo M with HIV (CD4 likely < 100) on HAART, history of bacterial
   meningitis, toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, who presents after being
   found unresponsive.
   # Altered Mental Status
      Presently more concerned for CNS infection given CD4 count of 40.
   Awaiting VL. Drug effect relatively less likely given long latency
   since most given. Will
   Major etiologies include drug effect, CNS infection, CNS lesion, status
   epilepticus/seizure, hypoxic injury in context of earlier drug
   intoxication, delirium secondary to other infection or compound of
   ADC/past neurologic injury with decreased reserve in context of
   infection. To this end we have examined drug interactions, held most
   psychotropics, perfomed CT and MRI, EEG and have investigated
   underlying infections and are treating pneumonia.
      HIV is important consideration for differential diagnosis. CD4 count
   on [**2135-12-2**] was 100 per uL and VL 79,000 copies/mL. Given rapid
   fluctuations and poor compliance previously, this may not represent
   present level. Primary CNS lymphoma unlikely given CSF, but await signs
   of leptomeningeal enhancement/infiltration on MRI. Cryptococcus CSF and
   blood negative. Given that we do not know where CD4 and VL are at
   present, we will assume he is seriously immune compromised. Syphilis
   (RPR), CMV (culture and PCR), HTLV-I, [**Male First Name (un) 561**] virus (unlikely in view of
   MR), SPECT for CNS lymphoma not yet done. [**Month (only) 51**] be worth repeating LP
   soon also if no other results helpful.
      CSF is bland except for high protein (76
 near double upper limit
   of normal). C/w viral meningitis and possibly mycobacterial if CD4
   count is low. Will await CD4 count and VL along with laboratory
   results. HTLV, HSV, VZV still possible although latter two might show
   in MRI also.
      Drug effect is likely given numerous psychotropic medications in
   context of very long medication list with unclear metabolic
   consequences. Temporally linked to restarting baclofen. Naloxone was
   effective initiall, but given patient on opioids may have non-specific
   arousing effect. Reserve may also be decreased given previous
   toxoplasmosis lesion including parabrachial nucleus, cuneiform area and
   posterolateral hypothalamus on the left - regions that are implicated
   for driving wakefulness. This lesion appears to be stable and he has
   clearly recovered cortical function after the original presentation,
   but this may result in decreased 'reserve', although this is
   speculative. Underlying pneumonia is another possible contributor.
   Other CNS infections are possible, but less likely given negative
   workup so far and bland CSF. Seizure does not appear likely in view of
   presentation and fluctuation, but EEG may not be helpful in context of
   fentanyl and Versed being given at that time. Possible secondary to
   hypoxemia in context of underlying pneumonia, although less likely.
     Pending tests: Viral cultures, VZV, HSV, CD4, HIV VL, AFBs pending
   from BAL.
   - Continue outpatient Keppra
   - HTLV [**Doctor First Name **] w/ reflex from blood
   - Galactomanin from blood
   - RPR
   - AFBs
   - Follow mental status - expect to clear given Rx of pneumonia and
   holding psychotropics
   - Minimize and use single [**Doctor Last Name **] sedation (with Versed)
   - F/u Neurology and ID recs
   - Treat underlying pneumonia
   - F/u pending tests as above
   - Consider SPECT for CNS lymphoma, perhaps after repeating LP if above
   not revealing.
   - Add-on diff. and LFTs
   # Hypoxemic Repiratory Failure
      Likely secondary to CNS depression and pneumonia (chemical versus
   bacteria), possible excess of sedating medications/psychotropcs, but
   less likely now mental status still poor despite holding psychotropics.
   Flu swabs negative. O2 sat down to 73% in ED. CXR not consistent with
   PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] intubated and sedated. Bronchoscopy showed particulate
   matter in RLL (likely aspiration).
   - Continue ceftrizxone/flagyl for aspiration and azithromycin for CAP
   - Stop tamiflu and precautions now antigen back
   - F/u BAL cultures, legionella
   - Minimize sedation as above
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   # Erythematous Lesion with Vesicle
   Unclear etiology. Vesicular lesion concerning for HSV versus bacterial.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be contact dermatitis. Unlikely bacteria in view of negative Gram
   stain. Await viral culture results.
   - Await results
   # HIV
   Last CD4+ 100 and viral load 79,000 [**2135-12-2**]. Need to repeat in view of
   poor compliance and rapid variation previously.
   - Inform Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12683**] patient in house.
   - Continue outpatient HAART regimen: Kaletra, Truvada, Atazanavir
   - Adjust medication regimen according to CD4 count.
   # Hx of Seizure
   Continue Keppra. Wife states that this episode was not like previous
   seizures.
   - EEG Today
   - FU Neurology Recommendations
   # Bradycardia
   Unclear cause. Widened pulse pressure absent. CT unchanged this a.m.
   Now less hypotensive during episodes of bradycardia. Seems bistable:
   Unresponsive, bradycardic, miotic versus activated, spontaneous
   movement and normal rate and pressure. Paroxysms of parasympathetic
   outflow and worsened mental status. Not obviously seizure activity and
   no motoric component.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV (CD4 likely < 100) on HAART, history of bacterial meningitis, toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, who presents after being found unresponsive. The patient has multiple medical complications including:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been progressively worsening over the past three days. Given the low CD4 count, the possibility of CNS infection is more likely. Drug effect, CNS lesion, status epilepticus/seizure, hypoxic injury, and delirium secondary to other infection are also considered. Tests pending include viral cultures, VZV, HSV, CD4, HIV VL, and AFBs from BAL.

2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to CNS depression and pneumonia. Excess sedating medications/psychotropics may also contribute to this condition. Flu swabs are negative, and bronchoscopy showed particulate matter in the right lower lobe (likely aspiration). Ceftriaxone/flagyl and azithromycin are being continued for aspiration and community-acquired pneumonia, respectively.

3. Erythematous Lesion with Vesicle: The patient has an unclear etiology erythematous lesion with a vesicle. It is concerning for HSV versus bacterial etiology. Contact dermatitis is unlikely. Viral culture results are pending.

   # Altered Mental Status
      Major etiologies include drug effect, CNS infection, CNS lesion,
   status epilepticus/seizure, hypoxic injury in context of earlier drug
   intoxication, delirium secondary to other infection or compound of
   ADC/past neurologic injury with decreased reserve in context of
   infection. To this end we have examined drug interactions, held most
   psychotropics, perfomed CT and MRI, EEG and have investigated
   underlying infections and are treating pneumonia.
      HIV is important consideration for differential diagnosis. CD4 count
   on [**2135-12-2**] was 100 per uL and VL 79,000 copies/mL. Given rapid
   fluctuations and poor compliance previously, this may not represent
   present level. Primary CNS lymphoma unlikely given CSF, but await signs
   of leptomeningeal enhancement/infiltration on MRI. Cryptococcus CSF and
   blood negative. Given that we do not know where CD4 and VL are at
   present, we will assume he is seriously immune compromised. Syphilis
   (RPR), CMV (culture and PCR), HTLV-I, [**Male First Name (un) 561**] virus (unlikely in view of
   MR), SPECT for CNS lymphoma not yet done. [**Month (only) 51**] be worth repeating LP
   soon also if no other results helpful.
      CSF is bland except for high protein (76
 near double upper limit
   of normal). C/w viral meningitis and possibly mycobacterial if CD4
   count is low. Will await CD4 count and VL along with laboratory
   results. HTLV, HSV, VZV still possible although latter two might show
   in MRI also.
      Drug effect is likely given numerous psychotropic medications in
   context of very long medication list with unclear metabolic
   consequences. Temporally linked to restarting baclofen. Naloxone was
   effective initiall, but given patient on opioids may have non-specific
   arousing effect. Reserve may also be decreased given previous
   toxoplasmosis lesion including parabrachial nucleus, cuneiform area and

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV, presenting with progressive worsening of mental status and ataxia over three days before admission. He has a CD4 count likely less than 100 and is on HAART therapy. The patient has a history of bacterial meningitis, toxoplasmosis, and seizure disorder. He was found unresponsive and admitted to the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and drug effect, CNS infection, CNS lesion, status epilepticus/seizure, hypoxic injury, and delirium are considered as possible etiologies. Imaging and investigations are ongoing.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to CNS depression and pneumonia. Excess sedating medications and psychotropics may also contribute to the condition. The patient has been intubated and sedated.
3. Erythematous Lesion with Vesicle: An unclear etiology lesion is present, which is concerning for HSV versus bacterial infection. Contact dermatitis is also a possibility. Viral culture results are pending.
4. Bradycardia: The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia with a heart rate ranging from 39-44 bpm. The cause is unclear, and the condition seems bistable, with periods of unresponsiveness and bradycardia alternating with spontaneous movement and normal"

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo M with HIV (CD4 likely < 100) on HAART, history of bacterial
   meningitis, toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, who presents after being
   found unresponsive.
   # Altered Mental Status
      Presently more concerned for CNS infection given CD4 count of 40.
   Awaiting VL. Drug effect relatively less likely given long latency
   since most given. Nonetheless, will check Keppra level. Unchanged
   imaging lowers suspicion for primary CNS lymphoma, PML,
   meningoencephalitis of HSV/HSV6. Primary CNS lymphoma unlikely given
   CSF, but await signs of leptomeningeal enhancement/infiltration on MRI.
   Cryptococcus CSF and blood negative. Given that we do not know where
   CD4 and VL are at present, we will assume he is seriously immune
   compromised. Syphilis (RPR), CMV (culture and PCR), HTLV-I, [**Male First Name (un) 561**] virus
   (unlikely in view of MR), SPECT for CNS lymphoma not yet done. [**Month (only) 51**] be
   worth repeating LP soon also if no other results helpful. CSF was bland
   on presentation except for high protein (76
 near double upper limit
   of normal). Repeat today shows normal glucose and protein with
   pleocytosis. Therefore less suspicious for viral meningitis or
   mycobacterial. Will await PCR for toxoplasmosis (he should be Toxo IgG
   positive and PCR negative). HTLV, MAC, HSV6, HSV, VZV still possible
   although latter two might show in MRI also. Pending tests: Viral
   cultures, VZV, HSV, CD4, HIV VL, AFBs pending from BAL. No sign of
   encephalitis on MR and not suspicious for primary CNS lymphoma.

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo M with HIV (CD4 152) on HAART, history of bacterial meningitis,
   toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, who presents after being found
   unresponsive.
   # Altered Mental Status
      Major etiologies include drug effect, CNS infection, CNS lesion,
   status epilepticus/seizure, hypoxic injury in context of earlier drug
   intoxication, delirium secondary to other infection or compound of
   ADC/past neurologic injury with decreased reserve in context of
   infection. To this end we have examined drug interactions, held most
   psychotropics, perfomed CT and MRI, EEG and have investigated
   underlying infections and are treating pneumonia.
      HIV is important consideration for differential diagnosis. CD4 count
   on [**2135-12-2**] was 100 per uL and VL 79,000 copies/mL. Given rapid
   fluctuations and poor compliance previously, this may not represent
   present level. Primary CNS lymphoma unlikely given CSF, but await signs
   of leptomeningeal enhancement/infiltration on MRI. Cryptococcus CSF and
   blood negative.
      CSF is bland except for high protein (76
 near double upper limit
   of normal). C/w viral meningitis and possibly mycobacterial if CD4
   count is low. Will await CD4 count and VL along with laboratory
   results. HTLV, HSV, VZV still possible although latter two might show
   in MRI also.
      Drug effect is likely given numerous psychotropic medications in
   context of very long medication list with unclear metabolic
   consequences. Temporally linked to restarting baclofen. Naloxone was
   effective initiall, but given patient on opioids may have non-specific
   arousing effect. Reserve may also be decreased given previous
   toxoplasmosis lesion including parabrachial nucleus, cuneiform area and
   posterolateral hypothalamus on the left - regions that are implicated
   for driving wakefulness. This lesion appears to be stable and he has
   clearly recovered cortical function after the original presentation,
   but this may result in decreased 'reserve', although this is
   speculative. Underlying pneumonia is another possible contributor.
   Other CNS infections are possible, but less likely given negative
   workup so far and bland CSF. Seizure does not appear likely in view of
   presentation and fluctuation, but EEG may not be helpful in context of
   fentanyl and Versed being given at that time. Possible secondary to
   hypoxemia in context of underlying pneumonia, although less likely.
   - Continue outpatient Keppra
   - Add-on PCR for HSV/VZV, consider HTLV later
   - Follow mental status - expect to clear given Rx of pneumonia and
   holding psychotropics
   - Minimize and use single [**Doctor Last Name **] sedation (with Versed)
   - F/u Neurology and ID recs
   - Await final MRI read
   - HIV - CD4 and VL
   - Treat underlying pneumonia
   - F/u lab results for infection and flu
   # Hypoxemic Repiratory Failure
      Likely secondary to CNS depression and pneumonia (chemical versus
   bacteria), possible excess of sedating medications/psychotropcs. Flu
   unlikely. O2 sat down to 73% in ED. CXR not consistent with PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] intubated and sedated. Bronchoscopy showed particulate matter
   in RLL.
   - Continue ceftrizxone/flagyl for aspiration and azithromycin for CAP
   - Stop tamiflu and precautions now antigen back
   - F/u BAL cultures, legionella
   - Minimize sedation as above
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   # Erythematous Lesion with Vesicle
   Unclear etiology. Vesicular lesion concerning for HSV versus bacterial.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be contact dermatitis. Unlikely bacteria in view of negative Gram
   stain. Await viral culture results.
   - Await results
   # HIV
   Last CD4+ 100 and viral load 79,000 [**2135-12-2**]. Need to repeat in view of
   poor compliance and rapid variation previously.
   - Inform Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12683**] patient in house.
   - Continue outpatient HAART regimen: Kaletra, Truvada, Atazanavir
   - Adjust medications according to CD4 count.
   # Hx of Seizure
   Continue Keppra. Wife states that this episode was not like previous
   seizures.

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo M with HIV (CD4 likely < 100) on HAART, history of bacterial
   meningitis, toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, who presents after being
   found unresponsive.
   # Altered Mental Status
      Presently more concerned for CNS infection given CD4 count of 40.
   Awaiting VL. Drug effect relatively less likely given long latency
   since most given. Nonetheless, will check Keppra level. Unchanged
   imaging lowers suspicion for primary CNS lymphoma, PML,
   meningoencephalitis of HSV/HSV6. Primary CNS lymphoma unlikely given
   CSF, but await signs of leptomeningeal enhancement/infiltration on MRI.
   Cryptococcus CSF and blood negative. Given that we do not know where
   CD4 and VL are at present, we will assume he is seriously immune
   compromised. Syphilis (RPR), CMV (culture and PCR), HTLV-I, [**Male First Name (un) 561**] virus
   (unlikely in view of MR), SPECT for CNS lymphoma not yet done. [**Month (only) 51**] be
   worth repeating LP soon also if no other results helpful. CSF was bland
   on presentation except for high protein (76
 near double upper limit
   of normal). Repeat today shows normal glucose and protein with
   pleocytosis. Therefore less suspicious for viral meningitis or
   mycobacterial. Will await PCR for toxoplasmosis (he should be [**Month (only) 11219**] IgG
   positive and PCR negative). HTLV, MAC, HSV6, HSV, VZV still possible
   although latter two might show in MRI also. Pending tests: Viral
   cultures, VZV, HSV, HIV VL CSF. No sign of encephalitis on MR and not
   suspicious for primary CNS lymphoma.

   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure
      Likely secondary to CNS disorder and less due to pneumonia (chemical
   versus bacteria), possible excess of sedating medications/psychotropcs,
   but less likely now mental status still poor despite holding
   psychotropics. Flu swabs negative. O2 sat down to 73% in ED. CXR not
   consistent with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] intubated and sedated. Bronchoscopy

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV and a CD4 count of 40, presenting with altered mental status. He has a history of bacterial meningitis, toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, and is currently unresponsive. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/72 to 95/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and comatose, with clear lungs and good air entry. His heart sounds are dual and there are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no new skin lesion, but there is an area of erythema on his foot. His extremities are well perfused and he has poor nail care. The patient appears obtunded with no spontaneous movement, lordosis of the neck, and no response to sternal rub. His pupillary reactions are miotic and 2-3 mm, but reactive to light. His corneal reflex and photophobic squinting are intact. The patient has flaccid tone in his limbs, normal neck tone, and downgoing toes.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, platelet count of "

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART, who presented with unresponsiveness and progressive obtundation. He was found to have respiratory failure due to aspiration. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, pneumonia, and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains tachypneic with respiratory alkalosis, which may lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient's vital signs show hypotension, and he has a history of bacterial meningitis. This increases the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. HIV-related opportunistic infections: The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV increases the risk of opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, or fungal infections.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium or seizures, and the cause of his neurological decline needs further investigation through EEG and other tests.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's laboratory values indicate elevated serum creatinine levels, suggesting potential kidney dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by sepsis or other underlying conditions.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immob"

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo M with HIV (CD4 40) on HAART, history of bacterial meningitis,
   toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, who presents with progressive decline
   in mental status, ataxia, then found unresponsive and hypopneic.
   # Altered Mental Status: Broadly speaking concern for infection,
   medication/toxic, seizure as etiology for alteration in mental status.
   Imaging without major change from prior. CSF unimpressive, however may
   represent viral infection. Neurology suggest pan encephalitis can
   present this way.
   - Await pending labs (see above and OMR)
   - Await Keppra level given possible (but unlikely) metabolic
   interactions
   - F/u Neurology and ID recs
   - Measles serology
   - Treat underlying pneumonia
   - Ask lab to hold original blood samples.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure
      Likely secondary to CNS disorder and less due to pneumonia (chemical
   versus bacteria), possible excess of sedating medications/psychotropcs,
   but less likely now mental status still poor despite holding
   psychotropics. Flu swabs negative. O2 sat down to 73% in ED. CXR not
   consistent with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] intubated and sedated. Bronchoscopy
   showed particulate matter in RLL (likely aspiration). Legionella
   Negative. PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. Now extubated and doing well. BAL shows strep.
   Pneumoniae.
   - Continue ceftriaxone/flagyl for 7 days for aspiration and
   azithromycin for 5 days for CAP
   - Minimize sedation as above
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   # Erythematous Lesion with Vesicle
   Unclear etiology. Unlikely bacteria given negative Gram Stain. Contact
   dermatitis also possible.
   - Await viral culture
   # HIV
   CD4+ 40 today and viral load 8,930. Discussed above approach with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12709**]. Unclear compliance at home, concern for new
   resistance patterns low given low viral load. Low CD4 presently likely
   due to present illness.
   - Continue outpatient HAART regimen: Kaletra, Truvada, Atazanavir
   - Adjust medication regimen according to CD4 count.
   # Hx of Seizure
   Continue Keppra. Wife states that this episode was not like previous
   seizures.
   - 24 hour EEG
   - Check Keppra level based on possible metabolic interaction
   - FU Neurology Recommendations
   # Bradycardia

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo M with HIV (CD4 40) on HAART, history of bacterial meningitis,
   toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, who presents with progressive decline
   in mental status, ataxia, then found unresponsive and hypopneic.
   # Altered Mental Status: Broadly speaking concern for infection,
   medication/toxic, seizure as etiology for alteration in mental status.
   Imaging without major change from prior. CSF unimpressive, however may
   represent viral infection.
   - FU VZV, HSV, HSV6, [**Last Name (LF) 11219**], [**First Name3 (LF) 561**]
   - Continue outpatient Keppra and check level given possible metabolic
   interactions
   - HTLV [**Doctor First Name **] w/ reflex from blood
   - Galactomannon from blood
   - RPR
   - F/u Neurology and ID recs
   - Treat underlying pneumonia
   - F/u pending tests as above
   - Add-on diff. and LFTs
   - Ask lab to hold original blood samples.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure
      Likely secondary to CNS disorder and less due to pneumonia (chemical
   versus bacteria), possible excess of sedating medications/psychotropcs,
   but less likely now mental status still poor despite holding
   psychotropics. Flu swabs negative. O2 sat down to 73% in ED. CXR not
   consistent with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] intubated and sedated. Bronchoscopy
   showed particulate matter in RLL (likely aspiration). Legionella
   Negative. PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - Extubate today
   - Continue ceftriaxone/flagyl for 7 days for aspiration and
   azithromycin for 5 days for CAP
   - F/u BAL cultures
   - Minimize sedation as above
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   # Erythematous Lesion with Vesicle
   Unclear etiology. Unlikely bacteria given negative Gram Stain. Contact
   dermatitis also possible.
   - Await viral culture
   # HIV
   CD4+ 40 today and viral load 8,930. Discussed above approach with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12709**]. Unclear compliance at home, concern for new
   resistance  paterns given low CD4/VL on current regimen.
   - Continue outpatient HAART regimen: Kaletra, Truvada, Atazanavir
   - Adjust medication regimen according to CD4 count.
   # Hx of Seizure
   Continue Keppra. Wife states that this episode was not like previous
   seizures.
   - 24 hour EEG

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV (CD4 count of 40) who presents with progressive decline in mental status, ataxia, and found unresponsive and hypopneic. He has a history of bacterial meningitis, toxoplasmosis, and seizure disorder. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 121/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is currently on HAART therapy for his HIV infection. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including altered mental status, hypoxemic respiratory failure, erythematous lesion with vesicle, HIV infection, and a history of seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's progressive decline in mental status could be due to various causes such as infection, medication/toxic effects, or seizures. It is important to continue monitoring his mental status and assess for any changes.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to CNS disorder and less due to pneumonia. It is important to treat underlying pneumonia and minimize sedation as much as possible.
3. Erythematous Lesion with Vesicle: The etiology of this lesion is unclear, and further investigation is needed. It could be related to bacterial, viral, or"

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo M with HIV (CD4 40) on HAART, history of bacterial meningitis,
   toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, who presents with progressive decline
   in mental status, ataxia, then found unresponsive and hypopneic.
   # Altered Mental Status: Broadly speaking concern for infection,
   medication/toxic, seizure as etiology for alteration in mental status.
   Imaging without major change from prior. CSF unimpressive, however may
   represent viral infection. Neurology suggest pan encephalitis can
   present this way.
   - Await pending labs (see above and OMR)
   - Await Keppra level given possible (but unlikely) metabolic
   interactions
   - F/u Neurology and ID recs
   - Measles serology
   - Treat underlying pneumonia
   - Ask lab to hold original blood samples.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure
      Likely secondary to CNS disorder and less due to pneumonia (chemical
   versus bacteria), possible excess of sedating medications/psychotropcs,
   but less likely now mental status still poor despite holding
   psychotropics. Flu swabs negative. O2 sat down to 73% in ED. CXR not
   consistent with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] intubated and sedated. Bronchoscopy
   showed particulate matter in RLL (likely aspiration). Legionella
   Negative. PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. Now extubated and doing well. BAL shows strep.
   Pneumoniae.
   - Continue ceftriaxone/flagyl for 7 days for aspiration and
   azithromycin for 5 days for CAP
   - Minimize sedation as above
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   # Erythematous Lesion with Vesicle
   Unclear etiology. Unlikely bacteria given negative Gram Stain. Contact
   dermatitis also possible.
   - Await viral culture
   # HIV
   CD4+ 40 today and viral load 8,930. Discussed above approach with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12709**]. Unclear compliance at home, concern for new
   resistance patterns low given low viral load. Low CD4 presently likely
   due to present illness.
   - Continue outpatient HAART regimen: Kaletra, Truvada, Atazanavir
   - Adjust medication regimen according to CD4 count.
   # Hx of Seizure
   Continue Keppra. Wife states that this episode was not like previous
   seizures.
   - 24 hour EEG
   - Check Keppra level based on possible metabolic interaction

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV, presenting with a progressive decline in mental status, ataxia, and subsequent unresponsiveness and hypopnea. The patient is on HAART therapy and has a CD4 count of 40. He has a history of bacterial meningitis, toxoplasmosis, and seizure disorder. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, respiratory failure, an erythematous lesion with vesicle, HIV infection, and a history of seizure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure could be due to an underlying infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of these symptoms.
2. Medication/Toxicity: Another possible cause of the patient's altered mental status is medication or toxicity. It is important to review the patient's medication regimen and consider any potential interactions or side effects.
3. Seizure: The patient's history of seizure disorder raises the possibility of a seizure as the etiology for his altered mental status. A 24-hour EEG has been ordered to further investigate this possibility.
4. Pan Encephalitis: The neurology team suggests that the patient may have pan encephalitis, which can present with similar symptoms. Awaiting pending labs will help in confirming this diagnosis.
5. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to a CNS disorder rather than pneumonia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV on HAART, history of bacterial meningitis, toxoplasmosis, and seizure disorder. He presented after being found unresponsive, with progressive obtundation, gait disturbance, weakness, and respiratory failure due to aspiration. He was intubated and now extubated with some improvement in mental status but not completely back to baseline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: Microbiologic studies have been unrevealing so far. The patient's mental status is improving, but further investigation by ID (Infectious Disease) and Neurology is needed. Continuous monitoring and appropriate treatment should be continued.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recovered from respiratory failure as he is now extubated and doing well. Continued respiratory support may still be necessary depending on his current condition.
3. HIV: It is important to continue HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) for the management of HIV.
4. Other issues are being managed by the ICU team.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is crucial to consult with the healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and management plan."
