","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the critical care unit after experiencing a motor vehicle accident and ventricular fibrillation arrest with shock. The patient underwent catheterization and stent placement. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. Allergies: No known drug allergies. The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, aspirin, captopril, pantoprazole, acetaminophen, and allopurinol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and risk factors.
3. Nosocomial infection, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
4. Medication errors or adverse reactions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted after a motor vehicle accident and experienced ventricular fibrillation arrest with shock. The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization, which revealed total occlusion of the right coronary artery with left-to-right collaterals and a 90% ostial lesion in the left circumflex artery. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. There are no trauma findings on preliminary CT scan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, previous MI, and recent ventricular fibrillation arrest, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial ischemia.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.
3. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures like intubation increase the risk of infections, including pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and pressure ulcers.
4. Thromboembolic events: Despite prophylactic heparin, the patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and previous bilateral femoral artery occlusion.

 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2198-10-18**] 08:00 AM
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
   The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). However, the posterior wall
   (poorly visualized) may be hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
   minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) at age 36. He was admitted after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and ventricular fibrillation (VFib) arrest with shock. The patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) with collateral circulation and a 90% blockage in the omohyoid artery (OM1), for which he received bare-metal stents (BMS).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm with normal sinus rhythm (SR), blood pressure ranging from 128/70 mmHg to 157/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula, and weight of 87.4 kg. He is extubated and on 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 43%, hematocrit (Hct) of 36.5%, platelet (Plt) count of 187-204 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
   The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). However, the posterior wall
   (poorly visualized) may be hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
   minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) at age 36. He was admitted after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and experienced ventricular fibrillation (V fib) with shock. 

The patient has undergone coronary angiography, which revealed total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) with left-to-right collateral circulation and a 90% lesion in the left omohyoid artery. The patient has received bare-metal stents (BMS) in two locations. He is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and antihyperlipidemics.

The patient's current condition in the ICU includes being extubated and maintaining good oxygen saturation. An echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and possible posterior hypokinesis. The patient has been treated for V fib with defibrillation and is being followed up for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and possible positron emission tomography (PET) scan due to claustrophobia.

Other conditions and treatments include prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with subcutaneous heparin, pain management with fentanyl, bowel regimen, and a soft"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) admitted after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) arrest with shock. The patient has a history of bilateral femoral artery occlusion, which made radial approach necessary during coronary catheterization.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Coronary artery disease with total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) and 90% obstruction of the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent (BMS) placement.
- Residual hoarseness post-extubation but improving.
- Hypertension being managed with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.
- Hyperlipidemia treated with statins and ezetimibe.
- Presumed gout, for which allopurinol is continued.
- Peripheral vascular disease (PVD), for which Pletal has been started.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate (HR) of 73 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 130/74 mmHg to 153/76 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.
