","The patient is a 49-year-old male with HIV and HCV cirrhosis who presents with abdominal pain, tachycardia, and negative paracentesis. The patient has a history of ascites and Crohn's disease. The assessment indicates that the tachycardia is likely multifactorial, possibly due to intravascular volume depletion and total body volume overload. The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to worsening ascites and potentially exacerbated GB wall edema. The possibility of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is considered, but unlikely. 

The patient has been started on albumin, pain control, and empirical antibiotics for SBP. A large volume paracentesis was performed yesterday. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have worsened since the last evaluation, with a daily MELD score of 29. The patient is on the transplant list and will undergo further evaluation with a liver consult and possibly an endoscopy. 

The patient also presents with mild hypoxemia, cough, and dyspnea, which could be due to increased abdominal distension. Infectious etiologies in an HIV+ patient with recently low CD4 counts should be considered. A chest X-ray has been ordered, and fluid cultures from the paracentesis will be followed. 

Additionally, the patient has mild hyponatremia, which has been stable since yesterday. Sodium phosphate will be given, and serum sodium trends will be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV cirrhosis, and Crohn's disease. He presented with abdominal pain, tachycardia, and negative paracentesis. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 128/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He has a distended abdomen that is tender to palpation, particularly in the right upper quadrant. There is no evidence of lower extremity edema. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function. He is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia, elevated lactate levels, and leukocytosis raise concern for sepsis. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and further evaluation is needed to determine the source of infection.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and ascites, SBP is a concern. The abdominal pain and tenderness may be related to worsening ascites. Gram stain and culture of the paracentesis fluid are pending.
3. Cholecystitis: Transplant surgery consultation was initially due to concern for cholecystitis, but"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 49 y/o M HIV, HCV cirrhosis c/b ascites and
   crohn's disease, p/w abdominal pain, tachycardia with negative
   paracentesis.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely multifactorial.  Would treat pain appropriately.
   Patient is likely intravascularly volume depleted and total body volume
   overloaded and anticipate HR may improve with IVF's & pain control.
   Given tachycardia must consider sepsis, but overall clinical picture
   more consistent with other more benign etiologies for his presentation.
   - patient received 100mg albumin
   - treat pain
   - f/u micro data (GPC in clusters/chains)
   - trend lactate
   - IVF @ 125ml/hr with boluses as needed based upon clinical exam
   - restart home metoprolol
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Likely related to worsening ascites.  Potentially
   exacerbated GB wall edema.  Unlikely SBP, but gram stain pending.
   Given tachycardia, immunosuppression, elevated lactate consider empiric
   antibiotics for SBP. Transplant surgery consult initially with
   significant concern for cholecystitis.  HIDA scan overnight reportedly
   normal.  Re-eval of CT scan with concern for right sided colitis.
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl
   - Large Volume paracentesis performed yesterday
   - treat empirically until culture negative
   - If culture positive, albumin 1.5g/kg today, and 1g/kg on day 3
   - serial exams
   - f/u final reads of CT Abd/Pelvis and  HIDA
   - ? transfer to transplant surgery service.
   .
   # Cirrhosis/HCV: Some worsening of LFT's since last evaluation.
   - daily MELD (MELD [**2169-4-27**] 29)
   - f/u liver consult with ? endoscopy
   - on transplant list
   .
   # Mild hypoxemia/cough/dyspnea: [**Month (only) 51**] be due to increased abdominal
   distenion.  Would consider infectious etiologies in this HIV + patient
   with recently low CD4 counts.
   - CXR
   - Paracentesis on [**4-26**] with 4L fluid removed; follow fluid cultures
   - Check LDH
   - follow clinically, now 95% on RA with no respiratory distress
   .
   # HIV: Last CD4> 200

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV cirrhosis, and Crohn's disease. He presents with abdominal pain, tachycardia, and negative paracentesis. The patient has ascites and is at risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He also has mild hypoxemia, cough, and dyspnea, which may be due to increased abdominal distention. The patient's liver function tests show some worsening since the last evaluation, indicating possible progression of cirrhosis. His CD4 count is above 200, and he is on HAART therapy for HIV. The patient has mild hyponatremia and chronic thrombocytopenia. He is receiving pain control with oxycodone and morphine, as well as treatment for nausea and hypertension. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and ascites, he is at increased risk for SBP. The presence of abdominal pain and elevated lactate levels raises concern for this condition. Empiric antibiotics have been started while awaiting culture results.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient's liver function worsens, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy developing. Monitoring for changes in mental status and neurological symptoms is important.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome"

","The patient is a 49-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis and HIV who was admitted with bacteremia, sepsis, and abdominal pain. The patient's abdominal pain has improved since yesterday but is still present. The patient underwent a paracentesis, EKG, blood cultures, and a nuclear medicine scan. He received antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The patient is also receiving other ICU medications such as morphine sulfate. 

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/64 mmHg to 133/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals moderate distress, warm skin, and right lower extremity edema of 1+ and left lower extremity edema of 1+. The patient's abdomen is described as soft, distended, and tender with mild diffuse tenderness. The patient's extremities are warm and well-perfused. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.8 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin at 9.1 g/dL,"

   # Tachycardia: Likely multifactorial.  Would treat pain appropriately.
   Patient is likely intravascularly volume depleted and total body volume
   overloaded and anticipate HR may improve with IVF's & pain control.
   Given tachycardia must consider sepsis, but overall clinical picture
   more consistent with other more benign etiologies for his presentation.
   - patient received 100mg albumin
   - treat pain
   - f/u micro data (GPC in clusters/chains)
   - trend lactate
   - IVF @ 125ml/hr with boluses as needed based upon clinical exam
   - restart home metoprolol
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Likely related to worsening ascites.  Potentially
   exacerbated GB wall edema.  Unlikely SBP, but gram stain pending.
   Given tachycardia, immunosuppression, elevated lactate consider empiric
   antibiotics for SBP. Transplant surgery consult initially with
   significant concern for cholecystitis.  HIDA scan overnight reportedly
   normal.  Re-eval of CT scan with concern for right sided colitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV cirrhosis, and Crohn's disease. He presents with abdominal pain, tachycardia, and negative paracentesis findings. The patient has several medical complications including coagulopathy, bacteremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), pain control, and mild hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding.
2. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the blood indicates a systemic infection, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): Although the paracentesis was negative, the patient has signs of infection in the abdominal cavity, which could progress to SBP if left untreated.
4. Pain Control: The patient's pain may be exacerbated by worsening ascites and potential gallbladder wall edema. Adequate pain management is crucial to prevent further complications.
5. HIV: The patient's immunosuppressed state increases the risk of opportunistic infections and complications related to HIV.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be due to intravascular volume depletion, total body volume overload, or sepsis. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause.
7. Mild Hypoxemia: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV cirrhosis, and Crohn's disease. He presented with abdominal pain, tachycardia, and negative paracentesis. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and peritonitis, likely due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He also has coagulopathy and pain control issues. The patient is intravascularly volume depleted and total body volume overloaded.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia and bacteremia may indicate a potential risk for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is necessary.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's chronic viral hepatitis and cirrhosis, there is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for altered mental status or other neurological symptoms would be important.
3. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Complications: The patient's history of HCV cirrhosis puts him at risk for complications such as liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and imaging studies may be required.
4. Crohn's Disease Complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease increases the risk of complications such as intestinal strictures, fistulas, or abscesses. Close monitoring for any worsening gastrointestinal symptoms"

","The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HIV, presenting with abdominal pain. He has been diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and bacteremia caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GBS). The patient has been receiving intravenous (IV) antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). 

The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, tachycardia with a heart rate between 100-131 beats per minute, and low blood pressure ranging from 91/42 mmHg to 128/69 mmHg. His respiratory rate is within normal limits at 17 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals mild bilateral crackles in the chest, a soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no peripheral edema. His neurological assessment is not detailed in the note.

The laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 24.8 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 39.0%, and reduced platelet count (Plt) at 59. The blood cultures are positive for GBS, while the stool culture is negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The other lab values, including electrolytes,"

   TTE ([**2169-4-28**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
   diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass
   or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen (good-quality study). Normal global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Mild to moderate
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-3-8**], the
   findings are similar. In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence
   of vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude
   endocarditis.

   # Bacteremia
 pan sensitive GBS
   - Ceftriaxone 2gm IV q 24 hours
   - d/c zosyn/vancomycin
   - trend WBC/Fever curve
   # Tachycardia: Likely multifactorial.  Would treat pain appropriately.
   Patient is likely intravascularly volume depleted and total body volume
   overloaded and anticipate HR may improve with IVF's & pain control.
   Given tachycardia must consider sepsis, but overall clinical picture
   more consistent with other more benign etiologies for his presentation.
   - patient received 100mg albumin
   - treat pain
   - trend lactate
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - restart home metoprolol
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Likely related to worsening ascites.  Potentially
   exacerbated GB wall edema.  Unlikely SBP, but gram stain pending.
   Given tachycardia, immunosuppression, elevated lactate consider empiric
   antibiotics for SBP. Transplant surgery consult initially with
   significant concern for cholecystitis.  HIDA scan overnight reportedly
   normal.  Re-eval of CT scan with concern for right sided colitis.
   - discontinued Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV cirrhosis, and Crohn's disease. He presented with abdominal pain, tachycardia, and negative paracentesis. The patient has multiple medical complications including bacteremia, tachycardia, abdominal pain, cirrhosis/HCV, mild hypoxemia/cough/dyspnea, mild hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, hypertension, and depression. He is currently receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS). He is being treated with intravenous ceftriaxone to clear the infection.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial, possibly due to intravascular volume depletion, total body volume overload, and pain. It is being managed with appropriate pain control and fluid management.
3. Abdominal Pain: The abdominal pain is likely related to worsening ascites and potentially exacerbated GB wall edema. There is a concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and the patient is being treated empirically with antibiotics. A transplant surgery consult has been initiated due to concerns for cholecystitis, but a HIDA scan overnight was reported as normal. Re-evaluation of the CT scan revealed concern for"

   49 yo man with HCV cirrhosis, HIV here with SBP due to GBS.
   SBP/bacteremia:  continue CTX.
   Hypoxemia: LLL infiltrate - could be atelectasis, no crackles on exam.
   Will hold off on treating for now, but will add vanco if fever curve
   starts to trend upward.
   Cirrhosis: Lasix/aldactone
   Anemia: Cont to follow.
