   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty who presents for evaluation for AVR and aggressive
   diuresis.
   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous
   admission. Initially not interested in surgical repair but agreed to
   cardiac cath with valvuloplasty. This was done [**2186-3-24**]. [**Location (un) 342**] improved
   from 0.5 to 0.64 and peak to peak gradient fell by 20mmHG. Patient
   tolerated the procedure and was discharged to rehab. Given continued
   symptoms, the patient is now agreeable to AVR. The preop eval was
   performed at previous admit. Patient is hesitant to get surgery, but
   after discussion with the team and her family, she is agreeable to be
   full code until the surgery and
   - dental consult
   - preop labs (LFTs, albumin, UA, coags, CBC, CMP)
   - CT surgery is following
   - hold coumadin
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen. On
   previous discharge she was on 2L NC. She is 3L negative so far for the
   hospital stay.
   - increase lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - add acetazolamide
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Hypoxia: From pulmonary edema. patient also has some degress of
   restriction from kyphosis
   - Pulmonology consult appreciated: f/u recs
   - high flow mask, wean as tolerated
   - diurese
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the
   alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG. Metabolic alk likely
   contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - start acetazolamide
   COPD: chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate controlled
   - hold coumadin for potential surgery
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis. She is currently in the ICU for evaluation and aggressive diuresis. The patient had a previous admission where she underwent valvuloplasty due to critical aortic stenosis. However, she still experiences symptoms, and now agrees to an aortic valve replacement (AVR) after discussion with the medical team and family. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 99.3°F, blood pressure of 111/45 mmHg, heart rate of 103 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on BiPAP. The patient is experiencing labored breathing and has a large non-tender goiter on the right side with elevated jugular venous distention (JVD) when sitting upright. A holosystolic murmur consistent with severe aortic stenosis is also present. 

Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and glucose levels. The arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis. 

The patient's medical conditions include acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic dysfunction likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia due to pulmonary edema and kyphosis.
2. Metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Goiter.
5. Congestive heart failure.
6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
7. Severe aortic stenosis.
8. Potential complications related to aortic valve replacement surgery, such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reaction to anesthesia."

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis. She was transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis. The patient's goals of care are to be DNR/DNI due to limited ability for meaningful recovery and the patient's wishes to avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is likely experiencing hypoxia due to kyphosis, fluid overload related to CHF, and aortic stenosis. There is no evidence of pneumonia.
2. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has been diagnosed with critical aortic stenosis, which has not improved significantly after valvuloplasty. She is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR).
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute-on-chronic systolic CHF, likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. She appears to be volume overloaded on examination and is currently requiring high-flow mask oxygen.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: This condition may be due to hyperventilation during ABG or contraction alkalosis from H+ loss during diuresis.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Goals of Care
   After multiple discussions yesterday, patient would like to be DNR/DNI
   given limited ability for meaningful recovery and patient
s wishes to
   avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness.
   - Palliative Care consult to assist with goals of care and discharge
   planning
   Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload
   related to CHF and aortic stenosis. No other evidence of pneumonia.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - diurese with goal 2L negative today
   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission
   with minimal improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical
   candidate for AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen.
   - continue lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the
   alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG. Metabolic alk likely
   contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD: chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate controlled
   - consider restarting coumadin
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload. The patient has been diuresing on lasix and is currently on high-flow mask oxygen. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 101/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a large non-tender goiter on the right side. She also has jugular venous distention elevated at 90 degrees. There is a holosystolic murmur consistent with severe aortic stenosis. Bibasilar crackles are heard in the lungs, and there is 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities. Neurologically, she has no focal deficits.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count of 233 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, total CO2 of 47, blood glucose of 146 mg/dL, and sodium of 134 mEq/L. Other labs include potassium, chloride, magnesium, phosphate, calcium, and lactic acid levels within normal ranges. The patient's goals of care are do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI), as she wishes to avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness. The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial and related to kyphosis, fluid overload, and aortic stenosis. The aortic stenosis is diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission and minimal improvement post-valvuloplasty. The patient is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Her chronic CHF is acute on chronic, systolic in nature, and likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. The patient is volume overloaded and requires high-flow mask oxygen. Metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis is present. The patient has chronic stable COPD, chronic atrial fibrillation, and chronic stable goiter. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and potential heart failure.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypoxia and bibasilar crackles indicate a risk for worsening respiratory status and potential pneumonia.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's fluid overload and use of lasix may contribute to renal dysfunction or worsening kidney injury.
4. Metabolic Complications: The patient's metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis need to be closely monitored and managed to avoid further complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to chronic illnesses and medications, increasing the risk of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

   valvuloplasty who presents for evaluation for AVR and aggressive
   diuresis.
   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous
   admission. Initially not interested in surgical repair but agreed to
   cardiac cath with valvuloplasty. This was done [**2186-3-24**]. [**Location (un) 342**] improved
   from 0.5 to 0.64 and peak to peak gradient fell by 20mmHG. Patient
   tolerated the procedure and was discharged to rehab. Given continued
   symptoms, the patient is now agreeable to AVR. The preop eval was
   performed at previous admit. Patient is hesitant to get surgery, but
   after discussion with the team and her family, she is agreeable to be
   full code until the surgery and
   - dental consult
   - preop labs (LFTs, albumin, UA, coags, CBC, CMP)
   - CT surgery is following
   - hold coumadin
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen. On
   previous discharge she was on 2L NC. She is 3L negative so far for the
   hospital stay.
   - increase lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - add acetazolamide
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Hypoxia: From pulmonary edema. patient also has some degress of
   restriction from kyphosis
   - Pulmonology consult appreciated: f/u recs
   - high flow mask, wean as tolerated
   - diurese
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the
   alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG. Metabolic alk likely
   contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - start acetazolamide
   COPD: chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate controlled
   - hold coumadin for potential surgery
   - continue rate control with metoprolol

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis. She presented for evaluation for aortic valve replacement (AVR) and aggressive diuresis. The patient previously underwent valvuloplasty but still experiences symptoms. She is now agreeable to AVR, but hesitant about surgery. 

Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has critical aortic stenosis, which is causing symptoms and affecting her cardiac function.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure secondary to severe aortic stenosis. She is volume overloaded and requires diuretic therapy.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia likely due to pulmonary edema. Oxygen therapy and diuretic therapy are being implemented.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance, which may be due to diuretic use and hyperventilation during ABG.
5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has chronic, stable COPD, which requires continued nebulizer treatments and supplemental oxygen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and critical aortic stenosis. She was transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload. The patient has been switched to DNR/DNI and is receiving palliative care. 

24-hour events include continuing lasix infusion, titrating to urine output, decreasing dose from 20 to 10 when urine output is greater than 2 liters and systolic blood pressure is low 80s. The patient is refusing oral medications, so metoprolol has been changed to intravenous administration. Palliative care has been consulted and will see the patient tomorrow. The patient reports not wanting to take medications that will prolong life. Family discussions regarding goals of care are ongoing, and there is a general agreement to not escalate care. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/61 mmHg to 82/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,255 mL, output of 3,390 mL, resulting in a balance of -2,135 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals a large nontender goiter on the right side, jugular venous distention elevated at 90 degrees, harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, and a blowing systolic murmur at the apex. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but there is limited effort and difficulty positioning. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness or masses. There is 3+ pitting edema in both lower extremities. 

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 233 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 45 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, glucose of 126 mg/dL, potassium of 4.7 mEq/L, sodium of 137 mEq/L, chloride of 105 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 26.9%, and magnesium of 2.5 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient's goals of care are to focus on comfort and quality of life, with a decision not to escalate care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial and may be related to kyph"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Goals of Care
   After multiple discussions yesterday, patient would like to be DNR/DNI
   given limited ability for meaningful recovery and patient
s wishes to
   avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness.
   - Palliative Care consult to assist with goals of care and discharge
   planning
   Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload
   related to CHF and aortic stenosis. No other evidence of pneumonia.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - diurese with goal 2L negative today
   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission
   with minimal improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical
   candidate for AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen.
   - continue lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the
   alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG. Metabolic alk likely
   contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD: chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate controlled
   - consider restarting coumadin
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and aortic stenosis. He was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis. The patient's current condition indicates several potential medical complications.

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia likely due to kyphosis, fluid overload related to CHF, and aortic stenosis. There is no evidence of pneumonia. The plan is to appreciate pulmonary recommendations if tolerated, wean oxygen as tolerated, and diurese with a goal of 2L negative today.

2. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has critical stenosis diagnosed during a previous admission, with minimal improvement after valvuloplasty. He is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR). The plan is to continue diurezing carefully due to the risk of decreased preload.

3. CHF: The patient has acute-on-chronic systolic CHF, likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. He is clearly volume overloaded on examination and now requires high-flow mask oxygen. The plan is to continue lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates, exercise caution with diuresis as the patient"

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis. He was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis. The patient has refused to take oral medications and has been changed to intravenous metoprolol. He has expressed his desire to be DNR/DNI due to limited ability for meaningful recovery and a wish to avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness. Palliative care has been consulted to assist with goals of care and discharge planning.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/61 mmHg to 82/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula, and an atrial fibrillation heart rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a large nontender goiter on the right side, jugular venous distention elevated when sitting at a 90-degree angle, a holosystolic murmur with loss of S2 consistent with severe aortic stenosis, bibasilar crackles in the lungs, and 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male admitted to the ICU with a history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a recent diagnosis of aortic stenosis. He is currently refusing oral medications and has expressed no desire to prolong life. The family is in agreement to avoid escalation of care. The patient is receiving IV fluids, lasix, and metoprolol. His vital signs show low blood pressure, normal heart rate, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation at 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. The flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient has a metabolic alkalosis and altered mental status. The assessment includes ineffective coping, metabolic alkalosis, heart failure, aortic stenosis, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation. The plan includes providing palliative care, continuing nutrition and glycemic control, and initiating prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: Given the patient's history of heart failure and current symptoms, there is a potential for further deterioration"

   Goals of Care
   Multiple discussions related to patient
s goals of care and patient has
   been switched to DNR/DNI.
   - palliative care to see patient today
   - will try to coordinate family meeting today with Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   - discontinue a-line
   Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload related to
   CHF and aortic stenosis.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - transition from lasix drip to 120mg PO lasix with plans to increase
   as needed
   Atrial fibrillation
   Chronic, currently rate controlled
   - continue coumadin for now
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Aortic Stenosis
   Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission with minimal
   improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical candidate for
   AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   Acute on Chronic, systolic CHF.
   Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45% likely secondary to severe aortic
   stenosis. Patient is clearly volume overloaded on exam, although her O2
   requirement has now improved markedly.
   - transition to oral lasix
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis:
   Part of the alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG.
   Metabolic alk likely contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD
   Chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload due to critical aortic stenosis. The patient's goals of care have been discussed, and she has been switched to DNR/DNI. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/46 to 98/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Her physical examination reveals a large non-tender goiter on the right side, jugular venous distention elevated while sitting at 90 degrees, a harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, and a blowing systolic murmur at the apex. The patient also has crackles at the lung bases, bilateral lower extremity edema, and warm, dry skin.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidosis. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has chosen to be DNR/DNI/Do not rehospitalize, with a focus on palliative care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial, related to kyphosis, fluid overload, and CHF. It is important to continue lasix PO, appreciate pulmonary recommendations if tolerated, and wean O2 as tolerated.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled. Continuing coumadin for now and maintaining rate control with metoprolol is advised.
3. Aortic stenosis: The patient has critical aortic stenosis with minimal improvement after valvuloplasty. As the patient is not a surgical candidate for AVR, careful diuresis should be continued to prevent decreased preload.
4. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient's recent echo showed an ejection fraction of 45%, likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. She is volume overloaded, although her O2 requirement has improved. Continuing oral lasix, cautioning with diures"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload. The patient's goals and wishes are to be DNR/DNI/Do not rehospitalize. She has critical aortic stenosis, acute on chronic systolic CHF, and is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement. The patient is volume overloaded but requires careful diuresis due to the risk of decreased preload. She is currently receiving metoprolol for rate control and warfarin for atrial fibrillation. Her current vital signs include a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 92/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She has a large non-tender goiter on the right side, elevated jugular venous distension while sitting at 90 degrees, harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, and blowing systolic murmur at the apex. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and total CO2 levels. Her sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range. The patient's chest X-ray shows no new infiltrates.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and aortic stenosis who was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate/do not rehospitalize (DNR/DNI/Do not rehospitalize) status and is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR).

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial hypoxia related to kyphosis, fluid overload, and CHF. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation of tissues and organs.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled but can potentially lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure exacerbation.
3. Critical aortic stenosis: The patient's critical aortic stenosis may worsen over time, leading to progressive heart failure symptoms and potentially life-threatening situations.
4. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient has evidence of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, which can result in worsening shortness of breath, fluid retention, and decreased cardiac output.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Given minimal chance for improvement at this point and patient
s goals
   and wishes, patient is DNR/DNI/Do not rehospitalize.
   Goals of Care
   Patient is  DNR/DNI / Do not hospitalize. Patient continues to be clear
   about these wishes
   - appreciate palliative care recs
   Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload related to
   CHF and aortic stenosis.
   - continue lasix 120mg PO daily
   - O2 for comfort
   Atrial fibrillation
   Chronic, currently rate controlled
   - continue coumadin for now
   - continue rate control with 25mg toprol XL
   Aortic Stenosis
   Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission with minimal
   improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical candidate for
   AVR
   -will continue to gentle diurese for improved respiratory status and
   comfort
   Acute on Chronic, systolic CHF.
   Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45% likely secondary to severe aortic
   stenosis. Patient is clearly volume overloaded on exam, although her O2
   requirement has now improved markedly.
   - continue oral lasix
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis:
   Part of the alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG.
   Metabolic alk likely contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD
   Chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, aortic stenosis, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and has an elevated jugular venous distension. The patient's large goiter and murmurs suggest cardiac involvement. The patient's lab results indicate metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute: The patient's symptoms such as elevated JVD, harsh systolic murmur, and blowing systolic murmur suggest diastolic heart failure.
2. Aortic Stenosis: The presence of a blowing systolic murmur at the apex and a harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border indicate aortic stenosis.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has 3+ pitting edema on the lower extremities, which may lead to impaired skin integrity and potential pressure ulcers.
4. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient has a history of nightmares and altered mental status, which needs further evaluation and management.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's lab results show an elevated TCO2 level, indicating metabolic alkalosis.
6. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's labs reveal im"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient appears very comfortable, a bit sleepy.  Plans of care
   previously outlined and are consistent with the patient's wishes for no
   aggressive care.  Palliative care recs appreciated.  Will transfer to
   rehab facility today with prn Seroquel and morphine, as well as on
   chronic warfarin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the critical care unit for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload. The patient's goals are to avoid aggressive care and focus on comfort. She is DNR/DNI and does not want to be rehospitalized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient may experience hypoxia due to kyphosis, fluid overload related to CHF, and aortic stenosis. Oxygen therapy and diuretics may be used to manage this condition.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled. Coumadin and rate control medications will continue to be used.
3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has critical aortic stenosis with minimal improvement post-valvuloplasty. She is not a candidate for surgical aortic valve replacement. Gentle diuresis will be continued for improved respiratory status and comfort.
4. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has an ejection fraction of 45% likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. She is volume overloaded on examination, and caution should be taken with diuresis as she is likely very preload-dependent.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis:"
