   Assessment and Plan
   47F with Gardners Syndrome and tunneled line, presented with likely
   line infection.
   1. GNR sepsis.  Most likely related to a line infection. Previously has
   had klebsiella bacteremia felt to be line related.  Has been on
   linezolid since her most recent discharge and thus far has not grown
   GPCs.  Initial lactate of 3.5, down to 0.8 with 4+ liters of IVF.
   - Volume resuscitation with improvement in SBP
   - Levophed with SBP goal of >80 to maintain perfusion
   - Continue GNR coverage with cefepime
   - D/c Flagyl
   - Add meropenem for double coverage GNR while awaiting speciation and
   to facilitate clearing maximum microbes from infected line
   - Continue GPC coverage with dapto until full report from [**Location (un) 1946**]
   re: speciation
   - Follow-up OSH micro
   - Will try to clear as much from line as possible with goal of changing
   IV access over wire by IR tomorrow
   - Hold TPN as line is infected
   2. Acute renal failure.  Resolving. Likely related to prerenal volume
   depletion.  FENA 1% and Cr trended down to 0.9.
   - Trend Cr
   3. Metabolic acidosis.  Has combination of elevated lactate and ARF
   though also non-gap component to this as well (possibly from ostomy
   output though does not report increase in this; now partly from IVF).
   - Trend ABG/HCO3
   - Add sodium bicarb today in short term
   4. Transaminitis. [**Month (only) 60**] be from hypoperfusion.  Less likely an infectious
   process. Trending down.
   - Trend LFTs until normalized
   5. Hyperglycemia. >200. Has had multiple elevated values over time.
   - F/u A1c
   - HISS while septic
   6. Anemia. At baseline.
   - Trend HCT
   7. Right femoral vein thrombosis
   - Continue Plavix
   8. Fibromyalgia causing generalized fatigue
   - Fentanyl patch for sustained relief
   - Fentanyl IV prn for breakthrough
   FEN: IVF boluses; regular diet for pleasure
   PPX: HSC; no need for PPI
   Presumed Full Code, but has mentioned to RN that she is DNR/DNI

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with Gardners Syndrome who presented with likely line infection. She has a history of klebsiella bacteremia, which was also line-related. The patient has been on linezolid since her most recent discharge and has not shown any growth of GPCs. 

Her initial lactate level was 3.5, but it has now decreased to 0.8 after receiving 4+ liters of IV fluids. The patient's blood pressure has improved, and she is currently on levophed with a goal of maintaining a systolic blood pressure above 80 mmHg. 

The patient's antibiotics have been adjusted to cover GNR sepsis, likely related to a line infection. She is currently receiving cefepime for GNR coverage, and meropenem has been added for double coverage of GNR while awaiting speciation and to facilitate clearing maximum microbes from the infected line. Daptomycin coverage for GPCs will continue until the full report from the microbiology lab regarding speciation is available. 

The patient's acute renal failure is resolving, likely related to pre-renal volume depletion. Her FENa is 1%, and her creatinine level has trended down to 0.9. 

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, which is a combination of elevated lactate and ARF, although there is a non-gap component as well (possibly from ostomy output though she does not report"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with Gardner's Syndrome and a tunneled line. She presented with a likely line infection, which led to GNR sepsis. The initial lactate level was high at 3.5, but it has improved to 0.8 with the administration of IV fluids.

The patient is currently on levophed for blood pressure support, with a goal of maintaining a systolic blood pressure above 80 mmHg. She is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime for gram-negative coverage, metronidazole for anaerobic coverage, and daptomycin for gram-positive coverage. The plan is to follow up with ostomy micro and discuss options for treating the line infection with the interventional radiology team.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, which is likely related to hypotension and volume depletion. Her fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is 1%, and her creatinine level has trended down to 0.9. The plan is to trend the creatinine levels.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, possibly due to elevated lactate from sepsis and acute renal failure. There is also a non-gap component to the acidosis, possibly from ostomy output, although the patient does not report an increase in this. The plan is to trend the ABG/hydrogen carbonate levels.

Furthermore, the patient exhibits"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is in the ICU and has experienced a significant drop in blood pressure, as indicated by the vital signs. The patient's heart rate is within normal range, respiratory rate is slightly low, and oxygen saturation is at 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine infusion to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's urine output has improved from 2.0 to 0.9 cc/kg/hr, and lactate levels have decreased from 3.5 to 0.8 mmol/L. These changes suggest that the patient's organ perfusion and renal function are improving.

The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications, including Demerol (meperidine), Compazine (prochlorperazine), Reglan (metoclopramide), Betadine Surgi-Prep (povidone-iodine), and morphine.

The patient was receiving antibiotics, specifically cefepime, daptomycin, and metronidazole, but the last doses were administered at different times.

The patient's neurological examination shows decreased strength in the right lower extremity compared to the left. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood glucose level is also high. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, and sodium are within normal limits.

   -Will continue with Meropenem for extensive coverage of GNR
   -Will D/C Flagyl at this time
   -Will pursue repeat blood culture and follow for fungal results
   possible
   -Hope for line change after reasonable antibiotic course but will have
   to balance with concern for limited access outside of current line.
   -LR to continue for IVF and could utilize HCO3- for non-gap component

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of line-related sepsis. She is currently presenting with hip pain and rigors, which are characteristic of previous admissions. Blood cultures have revealed gram-negative rods (GNRs) without speciation from [**2-8**] and [**2-9**]. The patient has been receiving levophed support for blood pressure despite early antibiotic treatment.

Based on the assessment, the patient has chronic indwelling catheter and new GNR bacteremia. In this setting, antibiotics will be expanded to include double coverage for GNR. The current antibiotics, Flagyl, Cefepime, and Daptomycin, were started last night due to concern for resistant GP organisms but have not shown resistance.

The plan is to continue with Daptomycin given the lactic acidosis at admission. Meropenem will be continued for extensive coverage of GNR. Flagyl will be discontinued at this time. Repeat blood cultures will be performed, and fungal results will be followed up on. It is hoped that a line change can be pursued after a reasonable antibiotic course, balancing it with the concern for limited access outside of the current line.

Levophed will be decreased as possible. Acute renal failure is likely pre-renal and has improved with intravenous fluid (IVF) at this time and effective maintenance of perfusion pressure. Creatinine levels will be followed up on. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN"

   Assessment and Plan
   47F with Gardners Syndrome and tunneled line, presented with likely
   line infection.
   1. GNR sepsis, hypotension.  Most likely related to a line infection
   with Klebsiella. Previously has had klebsiella bacteremia felt to be
   line related.  Has been on linezolid since her most recent discharge
   and thus far has not grown GPCs.  Initial lactate of 3.5, down to 0.8
   with 4+ liters of IVF.  Continues to require levophed for blood
   pressure support.  No evidence for abscess or other source of infection
   on CT scan.
   - Levophed with SBP goal of >80 to maintain perfusion (patient has low
   BP at baseline); anticipate that levophed requirements will diminish
   within 12-24 hours of having line changed out.
   - Continue GNR coverage with meropenem (D1 = [**2-10**]; cefepime & flagyl
   stopped)
   - Daptomycin stopped as no evidence of GPCs and patient has finished
   course for prior coag neg Staph bacteremia
   - f/u cultures & sensitivies from [**Location (un) 1946**]
   - Plan to change line over wire in OR today
   2. Acute renal failure.  Resolved. Likely related to prerenal volume
   depletion.  FENA 1% and Cr trended down to 0.9.
   - Trend Cr
   .
   3. Transaminitis.  Resolved.  Likely from hypoperfusion. Trending down.
   - Trend LFTs until normalized
   4. Hyperglycemia. Improving.  Likely related to infection.
   - HISS while septic
   5. Anemia. Now below baseline.  Drop may be, in part, related to IVF
   resuscitation.  No evidence for DIC or hemolysis on labs checked
   overnight.
   - Trend HCT, [**Hospital1 **] check or more frequent
   6. Right femoral vein thrombosis
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   7. Hypokalemia
 Patient has required aggressive potassium repletion
   for hypokalemia over the last 24 hours.
   - [**Hospital1 **]
 QID lyte checks with potassium repletion, predominantly IV as
   patient not tolerating or absorbing much PO.
   .
   8. Metabolic acidosis.  On admission had combination of elevated
   lactate and ARF though also non-gap component to this as well (possibly
   from ostomy output though does not report increase in this; now partly
   from IVF).  Received NaHCO3 on [**2-10**] and HCO3 is now improved & closer
   to her normal range.
   - Trend HCO3
   .
   9. Fibromyalgia causing generalized fatigue
   - Fentanyl patch for sustained relief
   - Fentanyl IV prn for breakthrough
   FEN: IVF boluses; regular diet for pleasure; Nutrition consult to
   restart TPN after new line is placed

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with Gardner's syndrome, who presented with a likely line infection. She has been diagnosed with GNR sepsis and hypotension, most likely related to a line infection with Klebsiella. The patient's initial lactate level was 3.5, which has decreased to 0.8 with the administration of 4+ liters of IV fluids. She continues to require levophed for blood pressure support. There is no evidence of abscess or other source of infection on the CT scan.

The patient's current medical conditions include acute renal failure (resolved), transaminitis (resolved), hyperglycemia (improving), anemia (below baseline), right femoral vein thrombosis, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and fibromyalgia causing generalized fatigue.

The plan of care includes maintaining a systolic blood pressure goal of >80 with levophed, changing the line over wire in the operating room today, continuing GNR coverage with meropenem, stopping daptomycin as there is no evidence of GPCs, and following up with cultures and sensitivities from [**Location (un) 1946**].

The patient's laboratory values show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine, elevated total bilirubin, low calcium, low magnesium, and low potassium levels. The patient's arterial blood gas (AB"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with Gardner's Syndrome and a tunneled line. She presented with likely line infection and was diagnosed with GNR sepsis. The patient has a history of previous klebsiella bacteremia also felt to be line-related. She has been on linezolid since her most recent discharge and has not grown GPCs. Her initial lactate level was 3.5, which has improved to 0.8 with 4+ liters of IVF. The patient is currently being volume-resuscitated, with Levophed used to maintain a blood pressure goal of >80 to ensure perfusion. She is being covered for GNR with cefepime, and Flagyl has been discontinued. Meropenem has been added for double coverage of GNR while awaiting speciation and to facilitate clearing maximum microbes from the infected line. GPC coverage with dapto will continue until the full report from [location] regarding speciation. Follow-up OSH micro is planned. The goal is to clear as much from the line as possible with the intention of changing IV access over a wire by IR tomorrow. TPN has been held due to the infected line. The patient's acute renal failure is resolving and likely related to prerenal volume depletion. Her metabolic acidosis is partly due to elevated lactate and ARF, although there is also a non-gap component. Trending down, sodium bicarb will be added in"

   47 yo female with short gut syndrome and chronically on TPN now
   admitted with recurrent sepsis--likely related to indwelling catheter
   and with GNR's found current plan of ABX and line change dominates
   current planning.
   1)Sepsis--Catheter related blood stream infection from indwelling
   catheter.
   -Line Change today
   -Wean Levophed as possible today with fluid bolus as
   needed--0.18--expect to wean as possible with Bactermia cleaered
   -Continue ABX--Meropenem
   -Patient intubated prior to TEE this morning
   2)Bacteremia-Much discussion across cardiology and ID on pace and
   nature of imaging studies--
   -Will pursue line change today
   -Will provide broad spectrum ABX
   -Will have to follow up on CT scan read and consider further
   diagnositic testing as pleural effusions are bilateral and less likely
   to represent infectious focus.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with short gut syndrome and chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) admission with recurrent sepsis, likely related to an indwelling catheter. The current plan includes antibiotic therapy and line change. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis - Catheter-related bloodstream infection from the indwelling catheter. The line change today and weaning off Levophed as possible are important steps to address this complication.
2. Bacteremia - Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being provided, and further diagnostic testing may be necessary to clear the infection.
3. Pleural Effusions - Bilateral pleural effusions are present, and the cause needs to be determined. Further diagnostic testing may be required.
4. Hypokalemia (Low Potassium) - Potassium replacement has been initiated.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity - The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and skin reactions, which may pose a risk for impaired skin integrity.
6. Hypotension - The patient's blood pressure is low, and fluid boluses may be given as needed.
7. Respiratory Failure - The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure.
8. Potential Kidney Injury - The elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) suggest the possibility of kidney injury.

   Assessment and Plan
   47F with Gardners Syndrome and tunneled line, presented with likely
   line infection.
   .
   1. GNR sepsis, hypotension.  Most likely related to a line infection
   with Klebsiella. Previously has had klebsiella bacteremia felt to be
   line related, now has pos bld cx from OSH.  Initial lactate of 3.5,
   down to 0.8 with 4+ liters of IVF.  Continues to require levophed for
   blood pressure support, but weaning down.  No evidence for abscess or
   other source of infection on CT scan.  TTE on [**2-11**] neg for vegetations,
   so less likely endocarditis. Daptomycin stopped as no evidence of GPCs.
   Femoral access line changed over wire on [**2-11**].
   - Levophed with SBP goal of >80 to maintain perfusion (patient has low
   BP at baseline); anticipate that levophed requirements will diminish
   within 12-24 hours of having line changed out.
   - Continue GNR coverage with meropenem day 3 (D1 = [**2-10**]; cefepime &
   flagyl stopped)
   - Sensitivies from [**Location (un) 1946**]: Resistant to Ampicillin; Sensitive to
   Cefazolin, Gent, Levo, Zosyn, and Bactrim.
   2. Acute renal failure.  Resolved. Likely related to prerenal volume
   depletion.  FENA 1% and Cr trended down to 0.4.
   .
   3. Transaminitis.  Resolved.  Likely from hypoperfusion.
   .
   4. Hyperglycemia. Improving.  Likely related to infection.
   - HISS while septic
   .
   5. Anemia. Now below baseline, but stable.  Drop may be, in part,
   related to IVF resuscitation.  No evidence for DIC or hemolysis on labs
   checked overnight.
   - Trend HCT
   .
   6. Right femoral vein thrombosis
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   7. Hypokalemia
 Patient has required aggressive potassium repletion
   for hypokalemia
   - [**Hospital1 **]
 [**Hospital1 **] lyte checks with potassium repletion, predominantly IV as
   patient not tolerating or absorbing much PO.
   .
   8. Metabolic acidosis.  Resolved. On admission had combination of
   elevated lactate and ARF though also non-gap component to this as well
   (possibly from ostomy output though does not report increase in this;
   now partly from IVF).  Received NaHCO3 on [**2-10**] and HCO3 is now improved
   & closer to her normal range.
   - Trend HCO3
   .
   9. Fibromyalgia causing generalized fatigue
   - Fentanyl patch for sustained relief
   - Fentanyl IV prn for breakthrough
   FEN: IVF boluses; regular diet for pleasure; TPN started 3/21 per
   nutrition consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with Gardner's Syndrome and a tunneled line. She presented with a likely line infection. The patient has a history of previous Klebsiella bacteremia felt to be line-related, now has positive blood cultures from OSH. She initially had a high lactate level of 3.5, which has decreased to 0.8 with the administration of 4+ liters of intravenous fluids. The patient continues to require norepinephrine for blood pressure support but is being weaned down. There is no evidence of abscess or other sources of infection on the CT scan. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on [**2-11**] was negative for vegetations, making endocarditis less likely. The femoral access line was changed over a wire on [**2-11**].

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. GNR sepsis, hypotension - most likely related to a line infection with Klebsiella. Previously had Klebsiella bacteremia felt to be line-related, now has positive blood cultures from OSH.
2. Acute renal failure - resolved. Likely related to prerenal volume depletion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions. He is currently in the ICU for an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has been experiencing pain and requires pain management. He also has hypokalemia (low potassium) and hypotension. There are concerns about impaired skin integrity, although no specific details are provided. The patient is on various medications including antibiotics, pain medication, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a Klebsiella infection that is resistant to ampicillin but sensitive to cefazolin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, zosyn, and bactrim. This indicates that the patient may be at risk for further infections if appropriate antibiotics are not administered.
2. Seizures: The patient has a known allergy to Demerol (meperidine Hcl) which can cause seizures as a side effect. This increases the risk of seizure activity if the medication is administered.
3. Allergic Reactions: The patient has allergies to Compazine (prochlorperazine maleate) and Reglan (metoclopramide Hcl), both of which can cause allergic reactions. This should be taken into consideration when prescribing medications.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The note mentions impaired skin integrity, although no specific details are provided. This could indicate a risk of pressure ulcers or other skin complications, which need to be"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock secondary to an infected femur fracture. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. 

The patient has undergone multiple surgical interventions, including debridement of necrotic tissue and placement of an external fixation device on the femur fracture. The patient's current condition is stable, but he is still experiencing severe pain and requires pain management.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 87/47 mmHg (51/33 mmHg), respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 40% and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.2 g/dL, blood glucose of 256 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 3.4 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 134 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 96 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 7.7 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 1.8 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) of 6.0 mg/dL. The patient also has elevated lactate levels at 1.6 mmol/L, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion.

The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time (PT) of 12.8 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 31.9 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1. The patient's fibrinogen level is within normal limits at 354 mg/dL.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 40 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 17 mEq/L. The patient's oxygen saturation is adequate at 97%.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no acute findings. The patient's ultrasound shows no valvular vegetations or significant valve disease.

The patient's medical team is considering switching the antibiotic from meropenem to Zosyn based on the urine culture results. The patient's pain is being managed with fentanyl, and he is also receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

1. Infection: The patient is already diagnosed with septic shock secondary to an infected femur fracture. There is a risk of further infections due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of invasive lines and devices.

2. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible renal impairment. This can be exacerbated by the use of nephrotoxic drugs and the patient's underlying conditions.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Adequate lung expansion and secretion management are crucial to prevent this complication.

4. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PT, PTT, and low fibrinogen level indicate a bleeding tendency. This increases the risk of bleeding complications during invasive procedures.

5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating hypotension. This could be due to septic shock or the effects of certain medications.

6. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium level"

The patient is a 47-year-old female with Gardner's Syndrome and a tunneled line who presented with likely line infection. She has a history of Klebsiella bacteremia, which was felt to be line-related. The patient has been on linezolid since her most recent discharge and has not grown GPCs thus far.

The patient is currently experiencing hypotension and requires norepinephrine for blood pressure support. There is no evidence of abscess or other source of infection on the CT scan. The initial lactate level was 3.5, which has improved to 0.8 with 4+ liters of IV fluid resuscitation.

The plan includes continuing GNR coverage with meropenem, stopping cefepime and flagyl, discontinuing daptomycin as there is no evidence of GPCs and the patient has completed her course for prior coag-negative Staph bacteremia. Cultures and sensitivities from [**Location (un) 1946**] will be followed up. The patient's line will be changed over a wire in the operating room today.

The patient also has acute renal failure, which has resolved and is likely related to prerenal volume depletion. Her creatinine level has trended down to 0.9. There is also transaminitis, which has resolved and is likely from hypoperfusion. Liver function tests are trending down.

   Assessment and Plan
   47F with Gardners Syndrome and tunneled line, presented with likely
   line infection.
   1. GNR sepsis, hypotension.  Most likely related to a line infection
   with Klebsiella. Previously has had klebsiella bacteremia felt to be
   line related.  Has been on linezolid since her most recent discharge
   and thus far has not grown GPCs.  Initial lactate of 3.5, down to 0.8
   with 4+ liters of IVF.  Continues to require levophed for blood
   pressure support.  No evidence for abscess or other source of infection
   on CT scan.
   - Levophed with SBP goal of >80 to maintain perfusion (patient has low
   BP at baseline); anticipate that levophed requirements will diminish
   within 12-24 hours of having line changed out.
   - Continue GNR coverage with meropenem (D1 = [**2-10**]; cefepime & flagyl
   stopped)
   - Daptomycin stopped as no evidence of GPCs and patient has finished
   course for prior coag neg Staph bacteremia
   - f/u cultures & sensitivies from [**Location (un) 1946**]
   - Plan to change line over wire in OR today
   2. Acute renal failure.  Resolved. Likely related to prerenal volume
   depletion.  FENA 1% and Cr trended down to 0.9.
   - Trend Cr
   .
   3. Transaminitis.  Resolved.  Likely from hypoperfusion. Trending down.
   - Trend LFTs until normalized
   4. Hyperglycemia. Improving.  Likely related to infection.
   - HISS while septic
   5. Anemia. Now below baseline.  Drop may be, in part, related to IVF
   resuscitation.  No evidence for DIC or hemolysis on labs checked
   overnight.
   - Trend HCT, [**Hospital1 **] check or more frequent
   6. Right femoral vein thrombosis
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   7. Hypokalemia
 Patient has required aggressive potassium repletion
   for hypokalemia over the last 24 hours.
   - [**Hospital1 **]
 QID lyte checks with potassium repletion, predominantly IV as
   patient not tolerating or absorbing much PO.
   .
   8. Metabolic acidosis.  On admission had combination of elevated
   lactate and ARF though also non-gap component to this as well (possibly
   from ostomy output though does not report increase in this; now partly
   from IVF).  Received NaHCO3 on [**2-10**] and HCO3 is now improved & closer
   to her normal range.
   - Trend HCO3
   .
   9. Fibromyalgia causing generalized fatigue
   - Fentanyl patch for sustained relief
   - Fentanyl IV prn for breakthrough
   FEN: IVF boluses; regular diet for pleasure; Nutrition consult to
   restart TPN after new line is placed
   PPX: HSC; no need for PPI
   CODE: DNR/DNI, but will intubate for some procedures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with Gardner's syndrome and a tunneled line who presented with likely line infection. The patient has a history of Klebsiella bacteremia, which was believed to be line-related. She has been on linezolid since her most recent discharge and has not grown GPCs (Gram-positive cocci) thus far.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. GNR (Gram-negative rod) sepsis, hypotension: Most likely related to a line infection with Klebsiella. The patient is currently on levophed for blood pressure support.
2. Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely related to prerenal volume depletion.
3. Transaminitis: Resolved. Likely from hypoperfusion.
4. Hyperglycemia: Improving. Likely related to infection.
5. Anemia: Now below baseline. The drop may be, in part, related to IVF (intravenous fluid) resuscitation.
6. Right femoral vein thrombosis: Continue Plavix.
7. Hypokalemia: The patient has required aggressive potassium repletion for hypokalemia over the last 24 hours.
8. Metabolic acidosis: On admission, the patient had a combination of elevated lactate and ARF (acute renal failure). Now partly from IVF. The patient received NaHCO3 on [2-10] and HCO3 is now improved & closer to her normal range.
9. Fibromyalgia causing generalized fatigue: Fentanyl patch for sustained relief; Fentanyl IV prn for breakthrough.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and short gut syndrome. She has been admitted to the ICU with recurrent sepsis in the setting of gram-negative bacillus (GNR) bacteremia. The patient has shown a good response to the current meropenem dosing, with improved white blood cell count, decreased levophed requirement, and maintained renal function during sepsis treatment.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It is crucial to monitor and manage the patient's vital signs, infection parameters, and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has shown improvement in renal function following treatment for sepsis. However, acute renal failure may still be a concern, especially if there is further deterioration in kidney function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and fluid balance is essential.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has been experiencing hyperglycemia, as indicated by elevated glucose levels. Sliding scale insulin therapy may be required to maintain glycemic control.

4. TPN-related complications: As the patient has chronic TPN and short gut syndrome, she may be at risk for TPN-related complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infections, liver dysfunction, or electrolyte imbalances. Regular monitoring of T"

   Assessment and Plan
   47F with Gardners Syndrome and tunneled line, presented with likely
   line infection.
   .
   1. GNR sepsis, hypotension.  Most likely related to a line infection
   with Klebsiella. Previously has had klebsiella bacteremia felt to be
   line related, now has pos bld cx from OSH.  Initial lactate of 3.5,
   down to 0.8 with 4+ liters of IVF.  Continues to require levophed for
   blood pressure support, but weaning down.  No evidence for abscess or
   other source of infection on CT scan.  TTE on [**2-11**] neg for vegetations,
   so less likely endocarditis. Daptomycin stopped as no evidence of GPCs.
   Femoral access line changed over wire on [**2-11**].
   - Levophed with SBP goal of >80 to maintain perfusion (patient has low
   BP at baseline); anticipate that levophed requirements will diminish
   within 12-24 hours of having line changed out.
   - Continue GNR coverage with meropenem day 3 (D1 = [**2-10**]; cefepime &
   flagyl stopped)
   - Sensitivies from [**Location (un) 1946**]: Resistant to Ampicillin; Sensitive to
   Cefazolin, Gent, Levo, Zosyn, and Bactrim.
   2. Acute renal failure.  Resolved. Likely related to prerenal volume
   depletion.  FENA 1% and Cr trended down to 0.4.
   .
   3. Transaminitis.  Resolved.  Likely from hypoperfusion.
   .
   4. Hyperglycemia. Improving.  Likely related to infection.
   - HISS while septic
   .
   5. Anemia. Now below baseline, but stable.  Drop may be, in part,
   related to IVF resuscitation.  No evidence for DIC or hemolysis on labs
   checked overnight.
   - Trend HCT
   .
   6. Right femoral vein thrombosis
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   7. Hypokalemia
 Patient has required aggressive potassium repletion
   for hypokalemia
   - [**Hospital1 **]
 [**Hospital1 **] lyte checks with potassium repletion, predominantly IV as
   patient not tolerating or absorbing much PO.
   .
   8. Metabolic acidosis.  Resolved. On admission had combination of
   elevated lactate and ARF though also non-gap component to this as well
   (possibly from ostomy output though does not report increase in this;
   now partly from IVF).  Received NaHCO3 on [**2-10**] and HCO3 is now improved
   & closer to her normal range.
   - Trend HCO3
   .
   9. Fibromyalgia causing generalized fatigue
   - Fentanyl patch for sustained relief
   - Fentanyl IV prn for breakthrough
   FEN: IVF boluses; regular diet for pleasure; TPN started 3/21 per
   nutrition consult

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with Gardners Syndrome and a tunneled line, presenting with likely line infection. The patient has a history of previous Klebsiella bacteremia felt to be line-related. The current assessment indicates that the patient has GNR sepsis and hypotension, likely related to a line infection with Klebsiella. The patient's lactate level has improved from 3.5 to 0.8 with IV fluid resuscitation. The patient continues to require levophed for blood pressure support but is being weaned down.

Other medical complications that can arise include acute renal failure, resolved and likely related to pre-renal volume depletion; transaminitis, resolved and likely from hypoperfusion; hyperglycemia, improving and likely related to infection; anemia, now below baseline but stable; right femoral vein thrombosis; hypokalemia; metabolic acidosis, resolved; and fibromyalgia causing generalized fatigue.

   47F with Gardners Syndrome and tunneled line, presented with likely
   line infection.
   .
   1. GNR sepsis, hypotension.  Most likely related to a line infection
   with Klebsiella. Previously has had klebsiella bacteremia felt to be
   line related, now has pos bld cx from OSH.  Initial lactate of 3.5,
   down to 0.8 with 4+ liters of IVF.  Continues to require levophed for
   blood pressure support, but weaning down.  No evidence for abscess or
   other source of infection on CT scan.  TTE on [**2-11**] neg for vegetations,
   so less likely endocarditis. Daptomycin stopped as no evidence of GPCs.
   Femoral access line changed over wire on [**2-11**].
   - Levophed weaned off and at baseline SBPs in the 80s.
   - Continue GNR coverage, meropenem (D1 = [**2-10**]; cefepime & flagyl
   stopped) changed to ceftriaxone on [**2-12**].  To complete 14 day course
   from [**2-11**] (date of line change) per ID recs
   - Sensitivies from [**Location (un) 1946**]: Resistant to Ampicillin; Sensitive to
   Cefazolin, Gent, Levo, Zosyn, and Bactrim.
   - ?SVC lesion, unclear, rads does not think that CT chest will be high
   yield, will discuss further with ID.
   2. Acute renal failure.  Resolved. Likely related to prerenal volume
   depletion.  FENA 1% and Cr trended down to 0.4.
   .
   3. Transaminitis.  Resolved.  Likely from hypoperfusion.
   .
   4. Hyperglycemia. Improving.  Likely related to infection.
   - HISS while septic
   .
   5. Anemia. Now below baseline, but stable.  Drop may be, in part,
   related to IVF resuscitation.  No evidence for DIC or hemolysis on labs
   checked overnight.
   - Trend HCT
   .
   6. Right femoral vein thrombosis
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   7. Hypokalemia
 Patient has required aggressive potassium repletion
   for hypokalemia
   - [**Hospital1 **]
 [**Hospital1 **] lyte checks with potassium repletion, predominantly IV as
   patient not tolerating or absorbing much PO.
   .
   8. Metabolic acidosis.  Resolved. On admission had combination of
   elevated lactate and ARF though also non-gap component to this as well
   (possibly from ostomy output though does not report increase in this;
   now partly from IVF).  Received NaHCO3 on [**2-10**] and HCO3 is now improved

   11. Lower Abdominal pain
 no evidence for intraabdominal abscess on CT
   scan.  Pain has been improving overall since admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with Gardners Syndrome and a tunneled line, who presented with likely line infection. She has a history of Klebsiella bacteremia felt to be line-related. She was admitted with hypotension, suspected GNR sepsis, and positive blood culture from OSH. Her initial lactate level was 3.5, which decreased to 0.8 with IVF. She required levophed support for blood pressure but is now weaning down. No evidence of abscess or other source of infection was found on the CT scan. TTE on 2-11 was negative for vegetations, so less likely endocarditis. Daptomycin was stopped as there was no evidence of GPCs. The femoral access line was changed over wire on 2-11.

The patient's condition has improved over time. She has been weaned off levophed and is maintaining baseline SBPs in the 80s. She is currently on ceftriaxone for GNR coverage, and her sensitivities show resistance to ampicillin but sensitivity to cefazolin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, zosyn, and bactrim.

She has resolved acute renal failure, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. She has anemia that is stable but below baseline, possibly related to IVF resuscitation"

   bactermia in the setting of antibiotics and catheter change.
   1)Sepsis-
   -CTX to continue
   -Have discussed possible imaging further but in setting of negative
   blood cultures and clinical improvement will defer at this time but
   will have to clarify therapeutic implications of any potential findings
   before final decisions.  CT scan unlikely to be helpful and TEE would
   require intubation and would therefore defer further imaging at this

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and now admitted with catheter-related sepsis. The patient's hemodynamics have improved, and there is a suggestion of resolution of bacteremia in the setting of antibiotics and catheter change.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for catheter-related sepsis. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotics and monitor for any signs of infection or worsening sepsis.

2. Nutrition: The patient is receiving TPN and will continue to do so. Monitoring for any complications related to TPN, such as infections or electrolyte imbalances, is necessary.

3. Pain control: The patient requires pain management for both acute and chronic pain. Ensuring adequate pain control is important for the patient's comfort and overall well-being.

4. Line-related complications: The patient has multiple lines in place, including a tunneled (Hickman) line and a 22-gauge line. Regular assessment and monitoring for any signs of infection or other line-related complications are essential.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Monitoring for any signs of DVT or bleeding complications is necessary.

6. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and"
