   EGD
   It is difficult to determine if the 2 non-bleeding AVM's seen in the
   stomach today are the source of the GIB. They were very friable and in
   the setting of the patient's supratherapeutic INR, could certainly have
   bleed significantly. However, it is also possible that the patient may
   have another source of bleeding-- ie. colonic or other small bowel
   AVMs.
   CT head
   No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Ms. [**Location (un) 8721**] is a 77 yo w/o history of CHF, Afib on coumadin,
   presenting with GI bleeding and hypotension.
   #  Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed/Hypovolemic shock - Patient with
   melanotic stools for in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.  Shock
   most likely secondary to large volume blood loss.  EGD showed AVM's in
   the stomach. Hct has been stable at 30 s/p 9 total units PRBC.
   - As per GI, cannot definitively say that AVM's in stomach were the
   cause of bleed- may still have small bowel AVM's/bleed in large bowel.
   Will need [**Last Name (un) **] this AM and being prepped
   -  on PPI drip; octreotide d/c'ed because no evidence of variceal
   bleed.
   -  target MAP>65,  currently weaning off levophed
   -  hold enalapril, metoprolol, lasix and spironolactone
   .
   #  Respiratory failure - patient intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.  Patient without known underlying lung disease.
   - continue ventilator with AC increased TV from 350 to 400.
   - small tidal volumes - increased risk for ARDS given transfusion.
   .
   #  Altered mental status - possible secondary to paralytics/sedation
   given in ED and decreased clearance given poor perfusion and ARF.
   Concern re: intracranial hemorrhage.
   - Yesterday patient more awake and biting on ET tube; likely AMS due to
   sedation
   -No IC hemorrhage on CT
   .
   #  Acute renal failure - Likely secondary to ATN. baseline Creatinine
   1.3 now 3. K initially 6.6 now decreased to 4.2.  Pt oliguic on
   arrival, now with much better UOP.
   - Will continue to fluid resusictate and keep MAP>65
   .
   .
   #  Mixed acidosis - patient that an anion gap metabolic acidoses, an
   non-anion gap acidosis likely [**1-1**] diarrhea and fluid losses, ARF, and a
   respiratory acidosis. Now with gap of 13. Most recent lactate 1.6.
   - follow ABGs
   - HCO3 amps PRN to keep pH> 7.25
   .
   #  CAD - EKG with lateral ST changes concerning for ischemic changes
   and possibly demand ishcemia. patient not complaining of CP prior to
   arrival. CE with CK decreased, Trop increased 0.05 to 011
   - increase in troponin not surprising in setting of RF. CK's trending
   down. Would get one more set to make sure trop going down.
   - given possible ischemia transfusion goal is Hct 30.

","Summary:
- 77-year-old female with no history of congestive heart failure (CHF) or atrial fibrillation (Afib) presenting with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and hypotension.
- Supratherapeutic INR, melanotic stools, and evidence of acute blood loss anemia.
- EGD showed arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the stomach, but cannot definitively say if they were the cause of the bleed.
- Prepped for possible endoscopic treatment of AVMs.
- Target mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, currently weaning off levophed.
- Hold enalapril, metoprolol, lasix, and spironolactone.
- Intubated in the emergency department (ED) for airway protection.
- Respiratory failure with increased tidal volume (TV) from 350 to 400.
- Altered mental status possibly secondary to paralytics/sedation given in ED and decreased clearance due to poor perfusion and acute renal failure (ARF).
- No intracranial hemorrhage on CT.
- Acute renal failure likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- Mixed acidosis with anion gap metabolic acidosis, non-anion gap acidosis likely secondary to diarrhea and fluid losses, ARF, and respiratory acidosis.
- EKG with lateral ST changes concerning for ischemic changes and possibly demand ischemia.
- Trop increased from 0.05 to 0.11.
- Abdominal distension without retroperitoneal hematoma on CT abdomen/pelvis.
- Goals: full code, Hct 30, wean off levophed, continue ventilator with AC increased TV from 350 to 400.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension (not in shock) due to acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed.
2. Acute renal failure secondary to ATN.
3. Respiratory failure due to intubation in the ED for airway protection.
4. Altered mental status possibly secondary to paralytics/sedation given in ED and decreased clearance due to poor perfusion and ARF.
5. Mixed acidosis with anion gap metabolic acidosis, non-anion gap acidosis likely secondary to diarrhea and fluid losses, ARF, and respiratory acidosis.
6. Cardiac complications such as CAD with EKG changes concerning for ischemic changes and possibly demand ischemia.
7. Abdominal distension possibly secondary to ascites or other causes.
8. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer bleeding.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   It is difficult to determine if the 2 non-bleeding AVM's seen in the
   stomach today are the source of the GIB. They were very friable and in
   the setting of the patient's supratherapeutic INR, could certainly have
   bleed significantly. However, it is also possible that the patient may
   have another source of bleeding-- ie. colonic or other small bowel
   AVMs.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension.
- She has been intubated in the emergency department for airway protection and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells due to acute blood loss anemia.
- Endoscopy revealed arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the stomach, but it is unclear if these were the source of bleeding.
- There is a possibility of small bowel or large bowel AVMs causing the bleed.
- The patient is being prepared for a procedure to confirm the source of bleeding.
- She is on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip and octreotide was discontinued as there is no evidence of variceal bleed.
- The target mean arterial pressure (MAP) is set at >65, currently weaning off levophed.
- Medications such as enalapril, metoprolol, lasix, and spironolactone have been held.
- Hematocrit is being checked every 8 hours.
- The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to acute kidney injury (ATN).
- Her baseline creatinine was 1.3, now it is"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Location (un) 8721**] is a 77-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension. She was intubated in the emergency department for airway protection. She has been diagnosed with acute blood loss anemia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, mixed acidosis, and possible coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, which may be due to acute blood loss. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid resuscitation should be continued to maintain adequate perfusion.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It is important to continue fluid resuscitation and ensure adequate renal perfusion to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. Weaning off mechanical ventilation should be considered once the patient's respiratory status improves.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which could be secondary to sedation, decreased clearance due to poor perfusion, and acute renal failure. Regular neurological assessments and monitoring of sedation levels are necessary.

5. Mixed Acidosis: The patient has a mixed acidosis, with both anion gap metabolic acidosis and"

   It is difficult to determine if the 2 non-bleeding AVM's seen in the
   stomach today are the source of the GIB. They were very friable and in
   the setting of the patient's supratherapeutic INR, could certainly have
   bleed significantly. However, it is also possible that the patient may
   have another source of bleeding-- ie. colonic or other small bowel
   AVMs.

   Ms. [**Location (un) 8721**] is a 77 yo w/o history of CHF, Afib on coumadin,
   presenting with GI bleeding and hypotension.
   #  Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed/Hypovolemic shock - Patient with
   melanotic stools for in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.  Shock
   most likely secondary to large volume blood loss.  EGD showed AVM's in
   the stomach. Hct has been stable at 30 s/p 9 total units PRBC.
   - As per GI, cannot definitively say that AVM's in stomach were the
   cause of bleed- may still have small bowel AVM's/bleed in large bowel.
   Will need [**Last Name (un) **] this AM and being prepped
   -  on PPI drip; octreotide d/c'ed because no evidence of variceal
   bleed.
   -  target MAP>65,  currently weaning off levophed
   -  hold enalapril, metoprolol, lasix and spironolactone
   -  check hematocrit Q8 today

   #  Respiratory failure - patient intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.  Patient without known underlying lung disease.
   - continue ventilator with AC increased TV from 350 to 400.
   - small tidal volumes - increased risk for ARDS given transfusion.
   - transition to CPAP today after procedure.
   -  consider extubation tomorrow.

   #  Altered mental status - possible secondary to paralytics/sedation
   given in ED and decreased clearance given poor perfusion and ARF.
   Concern re: intracranial hemorrhage.
   - Yesterday patient more awake and biting on ET tube; likely AMS due to
   sedation
   -No IC hemorrhage on CT

   #  Acute renal failure - Likely secondary to ATN. baseline Creatinine
   1.3 now 3. K initially 6.6 now decreased to 4.2.  Pt oliguric on
   arrival, now with much better UOP.
   - Will continue to fluid resusictate and keep MAP>65
   .
   .
   #  Mixed acidosis - patient that an anion gap metabolic acidoses, an
   non-anion gap acidosis likely [**1-1**] diarrhea and fluid losses, ARF, and a
   respiratory acidosis. Now with gap of 13. Most recent lactate 1.6.
   - follow ABGs
   - HCO3 amps PRN to keep pH> 7.25

   #  CAD - EKG with lateral ST changes concerning for ischemic changes
   and possibly demand ishcemia. patient not complaining of CP prior to
   arrival. CE with CK decreased, Trop increased 0.05 to 011
   - increase in troponin not surprising in setting of RF. CK's trending
   down. Would get one more set to make sure trop going down.
   - given possible ischemia transfusion goal is Hct 30.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has had a colonoscopy that shows features of ischemic colitis,
   likely source of severe bleed. She has improved hemodynamically and it
   is unclear if mesenteric ischemia is inciting event or secondary to
   profound hypovolemia from GI blood loss. She has started to make
   increasing quantities of urine which is clear. She has not needed
   further transfusion either. If she remains stable hemodynamically later
   today, we will transition to CPAP/ PSV and hopefully work on attempting
   extubation within next 36 hours.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Ms. [**Location (un) 8721**] is a 77 yo w/o history of CHF, Afib on coumadin,
   presenting with GI bleeding and hypotension.
   #  Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed/Hypovolemic shock - Patient with
   melanotic stools for in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.  Shock
   most likely secondary to large volume blood loss.  EGD showed AVM's in
   the stomach. Hct has been stable at 30 s/p 9 total units PRBC.
   - As per GI, cannot definitively say that AVM's in stomach were the
   cause of bleed- may still have small bowel AVM's/bleed in large bowel.
   [**Last Name (un) **] shows ischemic colitis
   -  on PPI drip; octreotide d/c'ed because no evidence of variceal
   bleed.
   -  target MAP>65,  currently weaning off levophed
   -  hold enalapril, metoprolol, lasix and spironolactone
   -  check hematocrit Q8 today
   .
   #  Respiratory failure - patient intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.  Patient without known underlying lung disease.
   - continue ventilator with AC increased TV from 350 to 400.
   - small tidal volumes - increased risk for ARDS given transfusion.
   - transition to CPAP today after procedure.
   -  consider extubation tomorrow.
   .
   # fevers/GPCs in 1 blood cx bottle: cover GPCs c vanc (dosed by levels)
   and cefepime (empiric for fevers). Cefepime dosed for GFR of 11-60.
   Consider also cover for SBP or diagnostic tap.
   .
   #  Altered mental status - possible secondary to paralytics/sedation
   given in ED and decreased clearance given poor perfusion and ARF.
   Concern re: intracranial hemorrhage.
   - Yesterday patient more awake and biting on ET tube; likely AMS due to
   sedation
   -No IC hemorrhage on CT
   .
   #  Acute renal failure - Likely secondary to ATN. baseline Creatinine
   1.3 now 3. K initially 6.6 now decreased to 4.2.  Pt oliguric on
   arrival, now with much better UOP.
   - Will continue to fluid resusictate and keep MAP>65
   .
   #  Mixed acidosis - patient that an anion gap metabolic acidoses, an
   non-anion gap acidosis likely [**1-1**] diarrhea and fluid losses, ARF, and a
   respiratory acidosis. Now with gap of 13. Most recent lactate 1.6.
   - follow ABGs
   - HCO3 amps PRN to keep pH> 7.25
   .
   #  CAD - EKG with lateral ST changes concerning for ischemic changes
   and possibly demand ishcemia. patient not complaining of CP prior to
   arrival. CE with CK decreased, Trop increased 0.05 to 011
   - increase in troponin not surprising in setting of RF. CK's trending
   down. Would get one more set to make sure trop going down.
   - given possible ischemia transfusion goal is Hct 30.
   .
   # Ascites - abdomen distended and somewhat firm on exam.  No RP on Ct
   abd/pelvis; worried about possible malignancy.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation and on coumadin presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with acute blood loss anemia, gastrointestinal bleed, and hypovolemic shock. The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that showed angiodysplasias in the stomach. It is uncertain whether these angiodysplasias were the cause of the bleed, as there may still be small bowel angiodysplasias/bleed in the large bowel.

The patient is currently on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip, and octreotide was discontinued because there was no evidence of variceal bleed. The target mean arterial pressure (MAP) is greater than 65, and the patient is being weaned off levophed. Enalapril, metoprolol, lasix, and spironolactone have been held. Hematocrit will be checked every eight hours.

The patient also has respiratory failure and is intubated for airway protection. She is on mechanical ventilation with increased tidal volume from 350 to 400. There is a risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) given the transfusion. The plan is to transition to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) today after the procedure and consider extubation tomorrow.

The patient has fevers with Gram"

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with acute blood loss anemia, likely secondary to a large volume blood loss. The source of bleeding is suspected to be ischemic colitis, as indicated by the presence of ulcers in the sigmoid and descending colon during colonoscopy. The patient's hemoglobin level has been stable at 30 after receiving 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and has been intubated in the emergency department for airway protection. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL. The medical team plans to consider extubation if the patient shows improvement in her level of consciousness.

The patient has fevers and gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in one blood culture bottle, for which she is being covered with vancomycin and cefepime. Additionally, there is a concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or diagnostic tap if evidence of ascites is found on the right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to sedation and decreased clearance caused by poor perfusion and acute renal failure (ARF). There is also concern for intracranial hemorrhage, but a CT scan has ruled this out.

Acute renal failure is suspected to be secondary to acute tubular"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Ms. [**Location (un) 8721**] is a 77 yo w/o history of CHF, Afib on coumadin,
   presenting with GI bleeding and hypotension.
   #  Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed/Hypovolemic shock - Patient with
   melanotic stools for in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.  Shock
   most likely secondary to large volume blood loss.  EGD showed AVM's in
   the stomach. Hct has been stable at 30 s/p 9 total units PRBC.
   - As per GI, cannot definitively say that AVM's in stomach were the
   cause of bleed- may still have small bowel AVM's/bleed in large bowel.
   Will need [**Last Name (un) **] this AM and being prepped
   -  on PPI drip; octreotide d/c'ed because no evidence of variceal
   bleed.
   -  target MAP>65,  currently weaning off levophed
   -  hold enalapril, metoprolol, lasix and spironolactone
   -  check hematocrit Q8 today
   .
   #  Respiratory failure - patient intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.  Patient without known underlying lung disease.
   - continue ventilator with AC increased TV from 350 to 400.
   - small tidal volumes - increased risk for ARDS given transfusion.
   - transition to CPAP today after procedure.
   -  consider extubation tomorrow.
   .
   #  Altered mental status - possible secondary to paralytics/sedation
   given in ED and decreased clearance given poor perfusion and ARF.
   Concern re: intracranial hemorrhage.
   - Yesterday patient more awake and biting on ET tube; likely AMS due to
   sedation
   -No IC hemorrhage on CT
   .
   #  Acute renal failure - Likely secondary to ATN. baseline Creatinine
   1.3 now 3. K initially 6.6 now decreased to 4.2.  Pt oliguric on
   arrival, now with much better UOP.
   - Will continue to fluid resusictate and keep MAP>65
   .
   .
   #  Mixed acidosis - patient that an anion gap metabolic acidoses, an
   non-anion gap acidosis likely [**1-1**] diarrhea and fluid losses, ARF, and a
   respiratory acidosis. Now with gap of 13. Most recent lactate 1.6.
   - follow ABGs
   - HCO3 amps PRN to keep pH> 7.25
   .
   #  CAD - EKG with lateral ST changes concerning for ischemic changes
   and possibly demand ishcemia. patient not complaining of CP prior to
   arrival. CE with CK decreased, Trop increased 0.05 to 011
   - increase in troponin not surprising in setting of RF. CK's trending
   down. Would get one more set to make sure trop going down.
   - given possible ischemia transfusion goal is Hct 30.
   .
   # Ascites - abdomen distended and somewhat firm on exam.  No RP on Ct
   abd/pelvis; worried about possible malignancy.
   -Will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3252**] to better understanding of breast CA

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
- She presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute blood loss anemia, likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
- She is also experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to intubation in the emergency department for airway protection.
- The patient has altered mental status, which may be caused by sedation and decreased clearance due to poor perfusion and acute renal failure.
- She has acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis.
- The patient has a mixed acidosis, likely caused by anion gap metabolic acidosis, non-anion gap acidosis (possibly related to diarrhea and fluid losses), acute respiratory acidosis, and possibly ischemic changes.
- There are concerns about coronary artery disease, as evidenced by EKG changes suggesting ischemic changes.
- The patient has ascites, which could be related to possible malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension (not shock): The patient initially presented with hypotension, which has been attributed to large-volume blood loss.
2. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has acute blood loss anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring blood transfusions.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with acute blood loss anemia, likely due to ischemic colitis. The patient received 9 units of packed red blood cells and her hemoglobin level is now stable. She also has respiratory failure and is currently on partial support ventilation (PSV) mode with a tidal volume of 400 mL. The plan is to extubate her today and allow her to wake up more. 

The patient was previously febrile but is now afebrile, so cefepime has been discontinued. Vancomycin will continue to be administered, taking into consideration her improving renal function until December 3rd. The patient has hypernatremia, which will be corrected with D5W. Ascites will need further workup at some point, with a liver ultrasound to mark the ascites. Other issues are being managed by the ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has already received a transfusion of packed red blood cells to address this issue. However, ongoing bleeding or inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues due to the anemia could lead to further complications.

2. Ischemic colitis: This is the likely source of the gastrointestinal bleed. If not appropriately managed, it could progress and lead to sepsis or perfor"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has been experiencing melena (black, tarry stools) and has a history of supratherapeutic INR, which suggests a risk of bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, and they have received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to manage the anemia.

2. Ischemic colitis: The patient has ulcers in the sigmoid and descending colon, consistent with ischemic colitis. This condition may have contributed to the gastrointestinal bleeding and subsequent anemia.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This could be a result of the acute blood loss and ongoing bleeding.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.3 to 1.6, suggesting impaired kidney function. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypoperfusion and blood loss.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation in the emergency department for airway protection. They are currently on mechanical ventilation, and efforts are being made to extubate them when their mental status improves.

6. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which could be attributed to sedation and"

   most likely secondary to large volume blood loss.  EGD showed AVM's in
   the stomach. [**Last Name (un) **] with ischemic colitis which is likely source of bleed
   in light of elevated INR. Hct has been stable at 30 s/p 9 total units
   PRBC.
   - As per GI, likely that ischemic colitis in setting of high INR caused
   bleed. Hct has been stable.
   -  switched from PPI drip to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] today
   -  target MAP>65,  currently weaning off levophed
   -  hold enalapril, metoprolol, lasix and spironolactone
   -  check hematocrit Q12 today
   #  Respiratory failure - patient intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.  Patient without known underlying lung disease.
   - continue ventilator with AC increased TV from 350 to 400.
   - small tidal volumes - increased risk for ARDS given transfusion.
   - consider extubation when more awake
   .
   #  Altered mental status - possible secondary to paralytics/sedation
   given in ED and decreased clearance given poor perfusion and ARF.
   Concern re: intracranial hemorrhage.
   -No IC hemorrhage on CT
   -can extubate when mental status clears more

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with acute blood loss anemia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and hypovolemic shock. The patient has been experiencing melena, which is the passage of black, tarry stools, indicating upper GI bleeding. Endoscopic examination revealed arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the stomach, which are likely the source of bleeding. The patient also has ischemic colitis, which is another potential cause of bleeding. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, meaning it is higher than the normal range.

The patient was extubated and doing well with swallowing as per nursing assessment. However, no speech and swallow evaluation was performed. The patient's intravenous (IV) lines were not placed due to difficulty accessing the internal jugular vein; instead, a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line will be attempted tomorrow. The patient is hypernatremic, indicating high levels of sodium in the blood. An abdominal ultrasound was conducted to evaluate for ascites and possible malignancy contributing to the bleeding, revealing trace ascites.

The patient has no known drug allergies and received antibiotics (Vancomycin and Cefepime) on [date]. Other medications and ICU care are mentioned, but specific details are not provided.

Vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring data indicate the patient's heart rate (HR) is within normal range, blood pressure (BP) is"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed/Hypovolemic shock. The patient has been given a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and has stable hematocrit levels. The source of bleeding is likely ischemic colitis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. 

The patient was intubated in the emergency department for airway protection and successfully extubated yesterday. There are concerns about altered mental status, possibly secondary to paralytics/sedation given in the ED and decreased clearance due to poor perfusion and acute renal failure. However, a CT scan did not reveal any intracranial hemorrhage.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, which is likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The baseline creatinine level was 1.3, and it has now increased to 1.4. The patient was oliguric on arrival but now has much better urine output. It is important to keep the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, monitor urine output and creatinine levels.

Additionally, the patient has ascites, which is causing abdominal distension. There is also a concern about possible malignancy due to hypodensity noted in the liver. An abdominal ultrasound showed trace ascites, and a RUQ was performed yesterday, with the final read pending.

The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and cefepime"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for acute blood loss anemia, gastrointestinal bleed, and hypovolemic shock. The patient had melanotic stools and a supratherapeutic INR, which likely contributed to the bleeding. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the stomach, suggesting that these AVMs may be the source of the bleed. The patient was extubated yesterday and is tolerating oral intake well. However, the patient is hypernatremic and is receiving D5W to correct this. The patient also has trace ascites, which could be secondary to fluid overload after resuscitation. The patient's renal function has improved, with a decreasing serum creatinine level. The patient's respiratory status has stabilized, and he is no longer on pressors. There are ongoing concerns regarding the patient's altered mental status, which has resolved, and potential complications related to ischemic colitis. The patient's current plan includes monitoring hematocrit, continuing D5W for hypernatremia, and assessing for any signs of active bleeding. The patient will be kept on full code status and may be called out to the floor after PICC placement."

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   #  Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed/Hypovolemic shock - Patient with
   melanotic stools for in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.  Shock
   most likely secondary to large volume blood loss.  EGD showed AVM's in
   the stomach. [**Last Name (un) **] with ischemic colitis which is likely source of bleed
   in light of elevated INR. Hct has been stable at 30 s/p 9 total units
   PRBC.
   - As per GI, likely that ischemic colitis in setting of high INR caused
   bleed. Hct has been stable.
   -  switched from PPI drip to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  target MAP>65,  currently weaning off levophed
   -  hold metoprolol and spironolactone. Restart enalapril and lasix
   -  check hematocrit Q12 today
   #  Respiratory failure - patient intubated in the ED for airway
   protection, extubated yesterday successfully.  Still volume overloaded
   on cxr. TBB goal -1L to 1.5L.
   -pna unlikely will dc vanc/cefepime
   .
   #  Altered mental status - possible secondary to paralytics/sedation
   given in ED and decreased clearance given poor perfusion and ARF.
   Previous concern re: intracranial hemorrhage.
   -No IC hemorrhage on CT
   .
   #  Acute renal failure - Likely secondary to ATN, resolving. baseline
   Creatinine 1.3 now 1.4.  Pt oliguric on arrival, now with much better
   UOP.
   - Will continue to keep MAP>65, monitor UOP and creatinine.
   # Ascites - abdomen distended and somewhat firm on exam.  No RP on Ct
   abd/pelvis; worried about possible malignancy.
   -Has not had workup for ascities/increased bili in the past, also with

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension. She was admitted to the ICU with acute blood loss anemia, respiratory failure, and hypovolemic shock. The patient has been extubated and is doing well. However, she has increased edema and effusion on the right side, likely due to the removal of positive pressure. She received 1 liter of diuresis today and is oxygenating well on 1.5 liters of supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to acute blood loss anemia. This condition can cause symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously experiencing respiratory failure, although she has been extubated and is doing well. She may still be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or worsening lung function.
3. Hypovolemic shock: The patient initially presented with hypovolemic shock due to acute blood loss. Although she seems to be stable now, there is still a risk of fluid imbalance and potential cardiovascular complications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, seizures, and"

   precipitously and fibrinogen reassuring.
   -will trend
   -continue no heparin
   -review meds for any that could cause thrombocytopenia

   in setting of normal alk phos and AST/ALT. Hemolysis labs otherwise neg
   with occ schistos, normal LDH and hct not dropping.
   -likely secondary to receiving 9 units of blood, possible resorption of

   stable
 trending down very slowly, but no signs of active bleed

   - As per GI, likely that ischemic colitis in setting of high INR caused
   bleed. Hct has been stable.
   -  switched from PPI drip to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - now off pressors
   -  hold metoprolol, enalapril and spironolactone as hypotensive

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, systolic and diastolic murmur, and is currently on medications such as furosemide, pantoprazole, and cefepime.

The patient's recent events include the placement and removal of arterial, PICC, and trauma lines. The patient also underwent an EKG, which showed atrial fibrillation but no significant changes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 110/42 mmHg, heart rate of 56 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's labs indicate elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and troponin-T. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, but there is an increase in the percentage of lymphocytes. The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating between 38 and 58 thousand/mm3. The patient's bilirubin level is elevated at 6%, with a mixed indirect and direct pattern. The patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are within normal limits, but there is a slight increase in alkaline phosphatase. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient had an arterial line stopped, a PICC line started, and a trauma line stopped. The patient was intubated in the emergency department for airway protection and successfully extubated yesterday. The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of heart rhythm disturbances, including atrial fibrillation, and is currently on medication to manage this condition. There is a systolic and diastolic murmur noted on cardiac examination.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there are concerns about fluid overload as indicated by chest X-ray findings. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, and there are no signs of shock. However, the patient has shown episodes of bradycardia, which has been addressed.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient also has a history of high sodium levels and altered mental status, which has since resolved. The patient has received a significant amount of blood transfusions, resulting in possible resorption of significant bruising.

The patient's physical examination reveals peripheral edema and pitting, indicating potential fluid retention. The abdominal examination shows ascites, but further workup is needed to determine the underlying cause. There are concerns"

   during this admission.
   # Hyperbilirubinemia (mixed indirect and direct) up from normal to 6s
   in setting of normal alk phos and AST/ALT. Hemolysis labs otherwise neg
   with occ schistos, normal LDH and hct not dropping.
   #  Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed/Hypovolemic shock
 hematocrit
   stable
 trending down very slowly, but no signs of active bleed
   currently.
   - As per GI, likely that ischemic colitis in setting of high INR caused
   bleed. Hct has been stable.
   -  switched from PPI drip to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - now off pressors
   -  hold metoprolol, enalapril and spironolactone as hypotensive
   -  Restarted lasix yesterday got lasix 40 IV BID.
   -  check hematocrit Q12 today

   #  Respiratory failure - patient intubated in the ED for airway
   protection, extubated yesterday successfully.  Still volume overloaded
   on cxr. TBB goal -1L to 1.5L.
   -CXR findings this morning likely due to massive transfusion, fluid
   resuscitation.  Also have been holding home diuretics.

   # Altered mental status
 now resolved.  Previous symptoms possible
   secondary to paralytics/sedation given in ED and decreased clearance
   given poor perfusion and ARF.  Previous concern re: intracranial
   hemorrhage.
   -No IC hemorrhage on CT
   .
   #  Acute renal failure - Likely secondary to ATN,  she is now back to
   her baseline
   - Will continue to keep MAP>65, monitor UOP and creatinine.
   # Ascites - abdomen distended and somewhat firm on exam.  No RP on Ct
   abd/pelvis; worried about possible malignancy.
   -Has not had workup for ascities/increased bili (up to 2ish) in the
   past, also with hypodensity noted in liver

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory failure and was intubated for airway protection. The patient underwent an emergent central line placement due to hemodynamic instability. Subsequently, he developed thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and anemia secondary to massive blood loss. He also had hypernatremia and altered mental status, which resolved after addressing fluid resuscitation and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's condition improved, and he was successfully extubated. However, he continues to experience fluid overload and requires aggressive diuresis. The patient's recent labs show elevated D-dimer levels, indicating possible coagulopathy. His liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated bilirubin levels. There is a concern for possible malignancy given the findings on imaging. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but they were discontinued due to presumed contamination. The patient's family has been informed about his condition, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation and on Coumadin, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving treatment for acute blood loss anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated bilirubin levels. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/42 to 131/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is not in any acute distress and her physical examination is unremarkable except for a tortuous varicose vein in the right lower extremity. Laboratory results show a low platelet count, slightly elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated sodium level. The patient's blood glucose levels are also within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels indicate acute blood loss anemia, which can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhage.
3. Elevated bilirubin: The elevated bilir"
