   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation
   s/p MURD SCT on [**3-10**], recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] to rehab, now
   readmitted for increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status.
   #AMS-Likely etiology is thought to be infectious due to adenovirus and
   BK virus being detected in the [**Doctor Last Name 573**], but <500 copies of adenovirus and
   BK being very highly positive in the [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] thought to be due to BK
   encephalitis. Due to deterioration in mental status and persistent
   altered state, ID has recommended adding viral studies to the CSF and
   to start empiric treatment with IV cidofovir at 5mg/kg IV weekly. In
   addition, he will need IV hydration with NS and he must receive oral
   probenecid (as this does not come IV) for renal protection. Other
   etiologies of AMS could include toxic metabolic or medication effect
   given recent recent ativan and morphine for pain control. In addition,
   malignant process such as return of cancer could be possible but CSF
   did not show malignant cells. In addition, MRI, though a poor study did
   not show any other possible explanations.
   -Started treatment with cidofovir, patient tolerated probenecid and IVF
   hydration very well
   - Changed standing haldol to Zyprexa due to QTc prolongation, will
   continue to monitor QTc
   - ID and neuro following, appreciate recs
   -f/u CSF viral PCRs and well as pending cxs
   -started cidofovir 400mg and probenacid as directed by protocol
   -avoid mind alternating medications
 ativan, morphine, etc.
   -started thiamine IV x 5 days and po folate,
   -will f/u EEG from today
   -continue broad antibiotic coverage with daptomycin and meropenem
   pending further culture data
   -continue micafungin for fungal ppx while on heavy immunosuppression
   .
   #Hypothermia-has been improving with warming blankets, thought to be
   secondary to infection. Pt apparently displayed this physiology with
   his prior viral infectious. Could also be secondary to an endocrine
   source.
   -thyroid studies: TSH and T4 mildly decreased, but in the context of an
   acute illness are difficult to assess.  Could consider cortisol stim
   test if he remains hypothermic and no infectious etiology is found
   -warming blankets.
   -on daptomycin and meropenem in case of bacterial sepsis, as per ID
   team
   .
   # s/p CLL with BMT c/b GVHD
   -care per BMT team, discuss immunosuppressant and prophylactic
   regimens.
   -can d/c acyclovir with initiation of cidofovir
   .
   #GI:diarrhea, could be related to immunosuppression/medication effect,
   GVHD.
   - stool cultures  NG thus far.
   - iv fluids PRN
   - replete lytes.
   .
   #Elevated LFTs/bili-chronic since around [**4-25**], per BMT thought to be
   mainly due to GVHD, could be acutely worsened by viral infection.  Will
   continue to monitor and continue immune suppression regimen as per BMT
   team.
   -If worsens, consider RUQ u/s
   .
   #Anemia-baseline is chronic likely secondary to
   immunosuppresion/infection/GVHD, but acute drop in HCT today likely due
   to IVF administration, HCT fell below 21 today.
   -Check a type and screen since he does not have an active one.  F/U
   transfusion threshold with BMT but will likely transfuse 1 unit PRBC
   -Continue to monitor
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia-chronic as with anemia. Continue to monitor.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   I examined the patient today, reviewed the history and laboratory data
   and was present for the key portion of the services provided. I have
   also reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10627**]
s note above and largely agree with the
   findings and plan of care.  I have also discussed the patient
s status
   with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 383**].  Over the morning the patient has continued to be
   unresponsive and yet is now starting to look agitated again.
   Furthermore he has a rising lactate and a metabolic acidosis (7.27 on
   VBG, compared to 7.42 earlier today).  The possibility of sepsis is
   high, including intra-abdominal with his GVHD.  Given acidemia and
   severely altered mental status, we feel intubation is in order, and Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 383**] agrees and pt
s wife consents. If hemodynamically stable I
   concur with abd CT later today. Overall prognosis is very guarded, but
   for now we will continue max care.

   only 1+. Now that haldol, Zyprexa, and benadryl stopped, patient has
   times when he follows simple commands.  We will follow his clinical
   trajectory closely and for now hold off on intubation though if he
   becomes progressively acidotic or deeply obtunded we will have low
   threshold for intubation then.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and large cell transformation, who underwent myeloablative conditioning regimen and stem cell transplantation (SCT) on [**3-10**].
- The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] to rehab and was readmitted due to increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and mental status changes.
- The patient has been diagnosed with BK virus encephalitis and adenovirus infection in the urine.
- The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including hypothermia, electrolyte imbalances, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and non-gap metabolic acidosis.
- The patient's condition is critical, and the prognosis is very guarded.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's rising lactate levels and metabolic acidosis suggest the possibility of sepsis. Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and previous viral infections, bacterial sepsis should be considered and managed appropriately.
2. Intra-abdominal infection: GVHD can lead to gastrointestinal complications, including infections. The patient's diarrhea and abdominal pain may indicate an intra-abdominal source of infection.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and hyperventilation could progress to respiratory failure. Intubation was considered but has been temporarily held off due to improvement in the patient's condition"

   #AMS-Likely etiology is thought to be infectious due to adenovirus and
   BK virus being detected in the [**Doctor Last Name 573**], but <500 copies of adenovirus and
   BK being very highly positive in the [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] thought to be due to BK
   encephalitis. Due to deterioration in mental status and persistent
   altered state, ID has recommended adding viral studies to the CSF and
   to start empiric treatment with IV cidofovir at 5mg/kg IV weekly. In
   addition, he will need IV hydration with NS and he must receive oral
   probenecid (as this does not come IV) for renal protection. Other
   etiologies of AMS could include toxic metabolic or medication effect
   given recent recent ativan and morphine for pain control. In addition,
   malignant process such as return of cancer could be possible but CSF
   did not show malignant cells. In addition, MRI, though a poor study did
   not show any other possible explanations.
   -Started treatment with cidofovir, patient tolerated probenecid and IVF

   continue to monitor QTc

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   I examined the patient today, reviewed the history and laboratory data
   and was present for the key portion of the services provided. I have
   also reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10627**]
s note above and largely agree with the
   findings and plan of care.  I have also discussed the patient
s status
   with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 383**].  Over the morning the patient has continued to be
   unresponsive and yet is now starting to look agitated again.
   Furthermore he has a rising lactate and a metabolic acidosis (7.27 on
   VBG, compared to 7.42 earlier today).  The possibility of sepsis is
   high, including intra-abdominal with his GVHD.  Given acidemia and
   severely altered mental status, we feel intubation is in order, and Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 383**] agrees and pt
s wife consents. If hemodynamically stable I
   concur with abd CT later today. Overall prognosis is very guarded, but
   for now we will continue max care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and large cell transformation who underwent MURD SCT on [**3-10**]. He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] to rehab and is now readmitted for increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a rising lactate level and metabolic acidosis, which may indicate sepsis. The possibility of intra-abdominal sepsis due to GVHD is high.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is agitated and has a significantly decreased level of consciousness, which could lead to respiratory failure. Intubation has been recommended.
3. BK encephalitis: The patient's mental status changes could be due to BK encephalitis, as detected in the [**Doctor Last Name 573**]. Empiric treatment with IV cidofovir has been initiated.
4. Drug toxicity: The recent use of ativan and morphine for pain control could contribute to the altered mental status.
5. Malignant process: Although the CSF did not show malignant cells, the possibility of a return of cancer should be considered.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient requires IV hydration and oral probenecid for renal protection due to treatment with cidofovir.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has mild decreases in potassium and calcium levels, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and large cell transformation, who recently underwent MUD SCT and was discharged to rehab.
- He is now readmitted due to increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and altered mental status.
- The likely etiology of altered mental status is thought to be infectious, possibly due to adenovirus or BK virus detected in the urine.
- The patient has been started on empirical treatment with IV cidofovir and IV hydration, along with oral probenecid for renal protection.
- Other potential causes of altered mental status, such as medication effects or malignant process, are being considered and ruled out.
- The patient's QTc prolongation led to a change in antipsychotic medication from haloperidol to olanzapine (Zyprexa).
- Further investigations, including CSF viral PCR and CXR, are pending.
- The patient's hypothermia is being addressed with warming blankets.
- Thyroid studies have been ordered to assess for possible endocrine involvement.
- The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal prophylaxis due to immunosuppression.
- His anemia and thrombocytopenia are chronic and require monitoring.
- The patient's elevated liver function tests and bilirubin levels are likely due to GVHD, but could be exacerbated by viral infection.
- Anemia and thrombocytopenia are also chronic and"

   BK being very highly positive in the [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] thought to be due to BK
   encephalitis. Due to deterioration in mental status and persistent
   altered state, ID has recommended adding viral studies to the CSF and
   to start empiric treatment with IV cidofovir at 5mg/kg IV weekly. In
   addition, he will need IV hydration with NS and he must receive oral
   probenecid (as this does not come IV) for renal protection. Other
   etiologies of AMS could include toxic metabolic or medication effect
   given recent recent ativan and morphine for pain control. In addition,
   malignant process such as return of cancer could be possible but CSF
   did not show malignant cells. In addition, MRI, though a poor study did
   not show any other possible explanations.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and large cell transformation, who underwent MUD SCT on 3/10. He was recently discharged from Hospital1 to rehab but was readmitted due to increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and altered mental status. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 102/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments for different conditions, including AMS, hypothermia, GI issues, anemia, thrombocytopenia, non-gap metabolic acidosis, HTN, and HL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious complications: The patient is immunocompromised due to his medical history of CLL and BMT. He has been diagnosed with adenovirus and BK virus infections in his lungs, and there is a suspicion of BK encephalitis. He is receiving empiric treatment with IV cidofovir for viral infections, and further viral studies are planned.

2. Medication-related complications: The patient is on multiple medications, including immunosuppressants, antibiotics, antifungals, and sedatives. These medications can have side effects and interactions, which may contribute to his altered mental status and other complications.

3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient"

   improved today, even responds to voice commands and follows them. His
   acid base status seems like primary resp alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation in the form of a non anion gap acidosis.  Lactate and
   lytes are quite nicely stable.  TPN has been ordered. I
ve talked to Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 383**], and we agree that if a critical care bed is urgently needed
   tonight, Mr [**Known lastname 9130**] can be safely transferred to 7 Felberg for ongoing
   monitoring.  For now I would not re sedate him unless critically
   necessary to do so.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and large cell transformation post marrow transplant. He presented with increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with adenovirus and BK virus in his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cause of his altered mental status is believed to be infectious due to these viral infections. However, other potential causes such as toxic/metabolic effects, medication, or malignant processes have also been considered.

The patient has been started on empirical treatment with intravenous cidofovir at 5mg/kg weekly for viral encephalitis. He is also receiving IV hydration and oral probenecid for renal protection. All sedating medications have been withheld, and the patient is being closely monitored by the infectious disease and neurology teams. Further viral PCR testing and cultures are pending.

Other assessments and plans include:
- Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature is improving with warming blankets and is thought to be secondary to infection or possibly an endocrine source.
- CLL with bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient's immunosuppression regimen will continue as per the BMT team.
- Gastrointestinal issues: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which could be related to immunosuppression/medication effect, GVHD, or infection. Stool cultures are being obtained.
- Elevated liver function tests (LFTs)/bilirubin: The patient's LFTs have been chronically elevated since April 25th, likely due to GVHD. They may be acutely worsened by viral infection.
- Anemia: The patient's baseline anemia is likely secondary to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. An acute drop in hematocrit (HCT) today was likely due to IV fluid administration, and the patient received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- Thrombocytopenia: The patient's chronic thrombocytopenia will continue to be monitored.
- Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a primary respiratory alkalosis likely from a CNS origin, with metabolic compensation on top of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to diarrhea.

ICU care includes nutrition via total parenteral nutrition (TPN), glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation
   s/p MURD SCT on [**3-10**], recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] to rehab, now
   readmitted for increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status.
   #AMS-Patient appears more awake today. Likely etiology is thought to be
   infectious due to adenovirus and BK virus being detected in the [**Doctor Last Name 573**],
   but <500 copies of adenovirus and BK being very highly positive in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] thought to be due to BK encephalitis. Due to deterioration in
   mental status and persistent altered state, ID has recommended adding
   viral studies to the CSF and to start empiric treatment with IV
   cidofovir at 5mg/kg IV weekly. In addition, he will need IV hydration
   with NS and he must receive oral probenecid (as this does not come IV)
   for renal protection. Other etiologies of AMS could include toxic
   metabolic or medication effect given recent recent ativan and morphine
   for pain control. In addition, malignant process such as return of
   cancer could be possible but CSF did not show malignant cells. In
   addition, MRI, though a poor study did not show any other possible
   explanations.
   -Started treatment with cidofovir, patient tolerated probenecid and IVF
   hydration very well
   - Hold all sedating medication for now
   - ID and neuro following, appreciate recs
   - f/u CSF viral PCRs and well as pending cxs
   -started cidofovir 400mg and probenacid as directed by protocol
   -avoid mind alternating medications
 ativan, morphine, etc.
   -started thiamine IV x 5 days and po folate,
   - Consider holding EEG for now as do not want to give patient more
   sedation and appears to be improving..will touch base with Neuro
   -continue broad antibiotic coverage with daptomycin and meropenem ( Day
   1: [**8-25**]?) pending further culture data
   -continue micafungin for fungal ppx while on heavy immunosuppression
   - NG tube for oral meds in setting of AMS
   .
   #Hypothermia-has been improving with warming blankets, thought to be
   secondary to infection. Pt apparently displayed this physiology with
   his prior viral infectious. Could also be secondary to an endocrine
   source.
   -thyroid studies: TSH and T4 mildly decreased, but in the context of an
   acute illness are difficult to assess.  Could consider cortisol stim
   test if he remains hypothermic and no infectious etiology is found; but
   will likely be an innacurate readins as patient is on
   methylprenisolone.
   -warming blankets.
   -on daptomycin and meropenem in case of bacterial sepsis, as per ID
   team
   .
   # s/p CLL with BMT c/b GVHD
   -care per BMT team, discuss immunosuppressant and prophylactic
   regimens.
   - Continue cidofovir
   .
   #GI:diarrhea, could be related to immunosuppression/medication effect,
   GVHD.
   - stool cultures  NG thus far.
   - iv fluids PRN
   - replete lytes.
   .
   #Elevated LFTs/bili-chronic since around [**4-25**], per BMT thought to be
   mainly due to GVHD, could be acutely worsened by viral infection.  Will
   continue to monitor and continue immune suppression regimen as per BMT
   team.
   -If worsens, consider RUQ u/s
   .
   #Anemia-baseline is chronic likely secondary to
   immunosuppresion/infection/GVHD, but acute drop in HCT today likely due
   to IVF administration, HCT fell below 21 yesterday and s/p 1 unit
   prbc
s, with appropriate increase to 24.
   -Check a type and screen since he does not have an active one.
   -Transfustion threshold 21
   - Active type and screen
   - Guaiac stools
   -Continue to monitor
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia-chronic as with anemia. Continue to monitor.
   .
   #Non gap metabolic acidosis- Patient with primary respiratory alkalosis
   likely from CNS origin; with metabolic compensation on top of a non
   anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to diarrhea
   -Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - Follow bicarbs and vbg
   .
   #HTN-currently normotensive, will hold outpatient medications
   .
   #HL-currently holding statin given transaminitis

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation
   s/p MURD SCT on [**3-10**], recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] to rehab, now
   readmitted for increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status.
   #AMS-Patient appears more awake today. Likely etiology is thought to be
   infectious due to adenovirus and BK virus being detected in the [**Doctor Last Name 573**],
   but <500 copies of adenovirus and BK being very highly positive in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] thought to be due to BK encephalitis. Due to deterioration in
   mental status and persistent altered state, ID has recommended adding
   viral studies to the CSF and to start empiric treatment with IV
   cidofovir at 5mg/kg IV weekly. In addition, he will need IV hydration
   with NS and he must receive oral probenecid (as this does not come IV)
   for renal protection. Other etiologies of AMS could include toxic
   metabolic or medication effect given recent recent ativan and morphine
   for pain control. In addition, malignant process such as return of
   cancer could be possible but CSF did not show malignant cells. In
   addition, MRI, though a poor study did not show any other possible
   explanations.
   -Started treatment with cidofovir, patient tolerated probenecid and IVF
   hydration very well
   - Hold all sedating medication for now
   - ID and neuro following, appreciate recs
   - f/u CSF viral PCRs and well as pending cxs
   -started cidofovir 400mg and probenacid as directed by protocol-will
   need one more dose next Friday
   -avoid mind alternating medications
 ativan, morphine, etc.
   -started thiamine IV x 5 days and po folate, to help improve
   nutritional status
   - Consider holding EEG for now as do not want to give patient more
   sedation and appears to be improving..will touch base with Neuro
   -continue broad antibiotic coverage with daptomycin and meropenem ( Day
   1: [**8-22**]) pending further culture data and ID recs

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his hospital course and
   labs and was present for the key portions of the services provided.  I
   have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10627**]
s note above and agree with her findings and
   plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 9130**] remains somnolent but does open his eyes and
   follows simple commands at times.  His lactate and WBC remain normal
   and he
s hemodynamically stable.  His lytes suggest stable mild anion
   gap met acidosis which yesterday seemed clearly compensatory  to
   primary resp acidosis.  His platelets and Hct are lower today and we
   check with BMT service to get their wishes for platelet and rbc
   transfusions.  As he
s been stable for 3 days and TPN has been started,
   I would think he is ready for transfer back to the
   BMT floor and we
ll thus call him out today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and large cell transformation, who underwent MURD SCT on [**3-10**] and was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] to rehab. He is currently readmitted for increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and altered mental status. The patient's current condition indicates multiple medical complications that require immediate attention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious Etiology: The patient's altered mental status is suspected to be due to an infectious cause, with adenovirus and BK virus being detected in his system. The high positivity of BK virus in the [**Last Name (LF) 573**] suggests a possible BK encephalitis. Empiric treatment with IV cidofovir has been initiated, along with viral studies in the CSF.
2. Toxic/Metabolic Effects: Other potential causes for the altered mental status could include toxic or metabolic effects of medications such as recent use of ativan and morphine for pain control.
3. Malignant Process: The possibility of a return of cancer as an etiology for the altered mental status is also being considered. However, the CSF did not show malignant cells.
4. Renal Protection: Due to the risk of nephrotoxicity, the patient is receiving oral probenecid for renal protection.
5. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia is thought to be secondary to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation
   s/p MURD SCT on [**3-10**], recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] to rehab, now
   readmitted for increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status.
   #AMS-Patient appears more awake today. Likely etiology is thought to be
   infectious due to adenovirus and BK virus being detected in the [**Doctor Last Name 573**],
   but <500 copies of adenovirus and BK being very highly positive in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] thought to be due to BK encephalitis. Due to deterioration in
   mental status and persistent altered state, ID has recommended adding
   viral studies to the CSF and to start empiric treatment with IV
   cidofovir at 5mg/kg IV weekly. In addition, he will need IV hydration
   with NS and he must receive oral probenecid (as this does not come IV)
   for renal protection. Other etiologies of AMS could include toxic
   metabolic or medication effect given recent recent ativan and morphine
   for pain control. In addition, malignant process such as return of
   cancer could be possible but CSF did not show malignant cells. In
   addition, MRI, though a poor study did not show any other possible
   explanations.
   -Started treatment with cidofovir, patient tolerated probenecid and IVF
   hydration very well
   - Hold all sedating medication for now
   - ID and neuro following, appreciate recs
   - f/u CSF viral PCRs and well as pending cxs
   -started cidofovir 400mg and probenacid as directed by protocol-will
   need one more dose next Friday
   -avoid mind alternating medications
 ativan, morphine, etc.
   -started thiamine IV x 5 days and po folate, to help improve
   nutritional status
   - Consider holding EEG for now as do not want to give patient more
   sedation and appears to be improving..will touch base with Neuro
   -continue broad antibiotic coverage with daptomycin and meropenem ( Day
   1: [**8-22**]) pending further culture data and ID recs
   -continue micafungin for fungal ppx while on heavy immunosuppression
   - NG tube for oral meds in setting of AMS
   .
   #Hypothermia-has been improving with warming blankets, thought to be
   secondary to infection. Pt apparently displayed this physiology with
   his prior viral infectious. Could also be secondary to an endocrine
   source.
   -thyroid studies: TSH and T4 mildly decreased, but in the context of an
   acute illness are difficult to assess, cortisol will be inaccurate
   while patient is on high dose steroids
   -warming blankets.
   -on daptomycin and meropenem in case of bacterial sepsis, as per ID
   team
   .
   # s/p CLL with BMT c/b GVHD
   -care per BMT team
immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens.
   - Continue cidofovir for one more dose as per ID
   .
   #GI:diarrhea, could be related to immunosuppression/medication effect,
   GVHD.
   - stool cultures  NG thus far.
   - iv fluids PRN
   - replete lytes.
   .
   #Elevated LFTs/bili-chronic since around [**4-25**], per BMT thought to be
   mainly due to GVHD, could be acutely worsened by viral infection.  Will
   continue to monitor and continue immune suppression regimen as per BMT
   team.
   -If worsens, consider RUQ u/s
   .
   #Anemia-baseline is chronic likely secondary to
   immunosuppresion/infection/GVHD, HCT=20.1 today after continued IVF
   hydration
   - F/U with BMT about transfusing 1unit PRBC
   -Transfustion threshold 21
   - Active type and screen
   - Guaiac stools
   -Continue to monitor
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia-chronic as with anemia, but with recently decreasing
   platelets, will continue to monitor for signs of bleeding, has chronic
   GI bleeding and some weeping from edematous skin
cidofovir can cause
   thrombocytopenia
   - Will f/u with BMT about transfusion thresholds
   .
   #Non gap metabolic acidosis- Patient with primary respiratory alkalosis
   likely from CNS origin; with metabolic compensation on top of a non
   anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to diarrhea
   - If patient needs further IVF then will change to LR due to
   hyperchloremia
   -Continue to monitor respiratory status-currently sating well on 3LNC
   - Follow bicarbs and vbg
   .
   #HTN-currently normotensive
   - will continue metoprolol 12.5mg TID via NGT
   .
   #HL-currently holding statin given transaminitis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation post MUD SCT who was recently discharged from a hospital to rehab and is now readmitted for increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and waxing mental status. The patient appears more awake today, likely due to an infectious cause as adenovirus and BK virus were detected in the urine, although the copies of adenovirus were below 500. The ID team recommended adding viral studies to the CSF and starting empiric treatment with IV cidofovir at 5mg/kg IV weekly for BK encephalitis. Other potential causes of altered mental status include toxic/metabolic effects of medication, malignant process, and return of cancer, but these have been ruled out based on CSF analysis and MRI findings.

The patient is currently receiving IV hydration with NS, oral probenecid for renal protection, and has been started on treatment with cidofovir, which he tolerated well. All sedating medications have been held, and the ID and neuro teams are following up with recommendations. The patient will be monitored for further viral PCR results and pending cultures. Additionally, thiamine IV x 5 days and po folate have been initiated to improve nutritional status.

The patient's hypothermia is being managed with warming blankets, as it is thought to be secondary to infection or an endocrine source. Thyroid studies have shown mild decreases in TSH and T4, but"
