   65F with h/o chronic back pain found to have MSSA bacteremia and
   epidural abcesses with concern for cord compression on broad spectrum
   abx and on steroid taper being transferred back from floor to MICU for
   new melena/UGIB.
   .
   #. Bacteremia/extreme weakness: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of
   her spine. It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been
   spiking temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender
   abd and cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days.
   Husband called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c
ed [**10-29**].  Started decadron
   6q6 on [**10-23**], then on pred taper, which was discontinued.
   - Will undergo neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage,
   corpectomy, laminectomy, fusion) today
   - fu ID recs; Per ID, TEE intra-op or while intubated given CXR showed
   evidence of septic emboli
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess
   - fu cultures
   - consider ophtho consult for ?emboli to eyes
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - NPO / holding tube feeds
   - Continue pantoprazole gtt for another 24 hours, then switch to po ppi
   - Hct stable; check [**Hospital1 **] to ensure stable hct
   - f/u GI recs
    .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. better right after
   moving and after morphine. Pt states hip pain is different from her
   sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in the hospital.).   Hip
   CT unremarkable.
   - Morphine PCA with basal at 0.5 mg/hr, 0.5mg prn with 6 min lockout
   for now
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.
   .
   # Thrush: no c/o esophageal/swalling pain so likely limited to OP
   - nystatin s/s
   .
   # Yeast infection: miconazole powder. consider fluconazole if not
   improved by [**10-29**]
   .
   #. Rash: vastly improved.
   - treat infection as above
   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .
   #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above)
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics, improved
   .
   # Peripheral edema: got lasix [**10-19**] [**12-25**] o2 req and crackles b/l bases
   on exam. this resulted in rising Cr
   -continue to monitor

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain. She was found to have MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscesses, for which she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and a steroid taper. She was then transferred back to the ICU for new-onset melena/upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient is experiencing melena and UGIB. She has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and intravenous pantoprazole bolus + drip. An endoscopy showed multiple ulcers in the stomach and duodenum consistent with NSAID usage. The plan is to continue pantoprazole and switch to oral proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after 48 hours.

2. Fever, unknown origin (FUO): The patient's temperature has been spiking, reaching 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit. She has an increased white blood cell count and evidence of septic emboli on chest X-ray.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has diffuse pain where her body hits the bed, which is likely due to pressure ulcers. There is also mention of impaired skin integrity in the assessment section.

4. Pain: The patient is experiencing severe pain, particularly in her hip, which is different from her sciatic pain. Her pain is better after moving and after receiving"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, who was found to have MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscesses. She was initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids, and then transferred back to the MICU for new-onset melena/upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is tachycardic and febrile. Her abdominal pain has improved, but she still experiences discomfort. The patient underwent an endoscopy, which showed multiple ulcers in the stomach and duodenum consistent with NSAID usage. She received a blood transfusion and is now on pantoprazole drip for gastritis prophylaxis. 

The patient's pain control has been managed with morphine PCA. She has diffuse pain where her body touches the bed, but it improves after moving and morphine administration. Her hip pain is different from her sciatic pain, and her CT scan of the hip is unremarkable. 

The patient has several other medical issues, including acute respiratory failure (ARF) that has resolved, an impaired skin integrity with necrotizing arteritis, a yeast infection, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). She also has peripheral edema and tachycardia. 

The patient will undergo a neurosurgical procedure today to drain the epidural abscess and decompress the spinal cord. She will continue on nafcillin, and her antibiotic regimen will be adjusted based on culture results. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient's melena and endoscopic findings suggest ongoing bleeding. There is a risk of re-bleeding or persistent bleeding leading to anemia and hypotension.
2. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's fever and rising white blood cell count indicate a possible ongoing infection. The source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's epidural abscess and cord compression pose a risk of worsening neurological symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or bladder/bowel dysfunction.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prolonged immobilization and peripheral edema increase her risk for developing a DVT. Prophylaxis has been held due to her active gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient's use of NSAIDs and steroid treatment increase her risk for developing stress ulcers, which can lead to further gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): If the patient requires intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, a common complication in critically ill patients.

The patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and prompt management of potential complications to optimize her outcomes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with multiple MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) infections, recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and impaired skin integrity. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications including nafcillin, cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl for her infections. She is also receiving pain control with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The patient is scheduled for an operation today and will remain intubated post-operatively before being transferred back to the MICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Metastatic MSSA infection: The patient has multiple MSSA infection sites, and her infection is being managed with nafcillin. However, she has also been on cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl, indicating that the infection may be resistant or difficult to treat.
2. GI bleed/Blood loss anemia: The patient had a recent GI bleed, which has now resolved. Her hemodynamics and hematocrit levels are stable.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to her infections and compromised immune system.
4. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing fever, but the source of the fever is unknown.
5. Respiratory support: The patient is currently on low-flow oxygen via a nasal cannula and is not requiring mechanical ventilation. However, she will be intubated"

   moderate right pleural effusion, but there is sufficient lung
   opacification indicated by air bronchograms to raise possibility of

   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - Will get MRI T/L spine today per ortho spine recss
   - Pt is intubated and sedated for now, pending decreased swelling in
   the cervical spine and completion of spinal surgeries to wash out her
   spine.

   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.

   respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever curve, and
   get sputum cultures if cough develops.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - Pt is sedated and intubated for now, pending completion of spine
   surgeries; can re-start morphine PCA when pt is extubated.

   # Yeast infection: miconazole powder. consider fluconazole if not
   improved by [**10-29**]
   .
   #. Rash: vastly improved.

   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .
   #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, who presented with MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscesses. She underwent neurosurgical intervention (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy, laminectomy, fusion) yesterday. The patient also has multiple medical complications including GI bleed, pneumonia, peripheral edema, elevated LFTs, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Epidural Abscesses: The patient has epidural abscesses, which are likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection. This is a serious condition that can lead to spinal cord compression and neurological deficits if not treated promptly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may have pneumonia in the right lower lobe of her lung. This is indicated by progressive opacification in the right lower hemithorax on chest X-rays and the presence of crackles at the lung bases. Prompt antibiotic treatment is necessary to prevent the spread of infection.
3. GI Bleed: The patient has an upper gastrointestinal bleed, as evidenced by melena (black, tarry stools). She has been started on IV pantoprazole and will be switched to [**Hospital1**] PPI. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) showed ulcers consistent with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. It is important to control the bleeding and identify the underlying cause of the GI"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with multiple MSSA (Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) infection sites, recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and now s/p laminectomy. The patient has been critically ill and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: MSSA is a type of bacteria that can cause infections. The patient already has multiple MSSA infection sites, and there is a risk of further infections developing, especially considering her immunocompromised state due to critical illness.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient is mechanically ventilated, which carries its own set of risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, or ventilator-induced lung injury. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and regular chest x-rays may be necessary.

3. Bleeding: Although the patient's GI bleed has resolved, she may still be at risk for bleeding due to her critical condition and potential coagulopathy. Regular monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory values including clotting factors is essential.

4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an abnormal fluid balance with a positive fluid intake-output balance, indicating fluid overload. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid status and daily weight measurements are necessary.

5. Neurological complications: The patient underwent laminectomy surgery, which"

   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.
   It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been spiking
   temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender abd and
   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c

   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - f/u ortho spine recs
   - plan NPO post MN for spine surgery tomorrow ([**11-2**])
   - Pt is intubated and sedated for now, pending decreased swelling in
   the cervical spine and completion of spinal surgeries to wash out her
   spine.
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - NPO / holding tube feeds

   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, per recent
   films. Clinically, pt is afebrile and without cough or other
   respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever curve, and
   get sputum cultures if cough develops.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - Pt is sedated and intubated for now, pending completion of spine
   surgeries; can re-start morphine PCA when pt is extubated.

   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.

   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .
   #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above)
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics, improved

The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pain control, gastrointestinal bleed, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, and pneumonia. She also has thrush, a yeast infection, and a rash. Her elevated liver function tests are stable, and she has peripheral edema. The patient's current treatment includes Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess, IV PPI, and prophylaxis with Pneumoboots. She is scheduled for spine surgery on [**11-2**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently experiencing renal failure. This can be complicated by electrolyte imbalances and fluid disorders.
2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance is a concern, with a positive fluid balance of 1,701 mL since 12 AM. This may indicate fluid overload, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure.
3. Pain Control: The patient has diffuse pain where her body hits the bed, including hip pain and sci"

   65F with h/o chronic back pain found to have MSSA bacteremia and
   epidural abcesses with concern for cord compression on broad spectrum
   abx and on steroid taper being transferred back from floor to MICU for
   new melena/UGIB.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.
   It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been spiking
   temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender abd and
   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c
ed [**10-29**].  Started decadron
   6q6 on [**10-23**], then on pred taper, which was discontinued.
   - Underwent neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage,
   corpectomy, laminectomy, fusion) on [**10-30**]
   - fu ID recs
   - Per ID, TEE intra-op or while intubated given CXR showed evidence of
   septic emboli
 was not done during surgery, will d/w anesthesia today
   regarding potential for [**11-2**]
s surgery
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess
   - f/u cultures
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - f/u ortho spine recs
   - plan NPO post MN for spine surgery tomorrow ([**11-2**])
   - Pt is intubated and sedated for now, pending decreased swelling in
   the cervical spine and completion of spinal surgeries to wash out her
   spine.
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - NPO / holding tube feeds
   - Change pantoprazole gtt for another 24 hours to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hct stable; check [**Hospital1 **] to ensure stable hct
   - f/u GI recs
    .
   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, per recent
   films. Clinically, pt is afebrile and without cough or other
   respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever curve, and
   get sputum cultures if cough develops.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - Pt is sedated and intubated for now, pending completion of spine
   surgeries; can re-start morphine PCA when pt is extubated.
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.
   .
   # Thrush: no c/o esophageal/swalling pain so likely limited to OP
   - nystatin s/s
   .
   # Yeast infection: miconazole powder. consider fluconazole if not
   improved by [**10-29**]
   .
   #. Rash: vastly improved.
   - treat infection as above
   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .
   #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above)
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics, improved
   .
   # Peripheral edema: Got lasix [**10-19**] [**12-25**] o2 req and crackles b/l bases
   on exam and this resulted in rising Cr.  Pt
s baseline Albumin 1.9 on
   admission.
   - maximize FEN
   - continue to monitor
   .
   FEN: Ok for tube feeds today, NPO post MN for surgery on [**11-2**].
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, MSSA bacteremia, and epidural abscesses. She was previously on broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids but is now back in the MICU for new melena/upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She has renal failure, electrolyte/fluid disorder, pain control, and impaired skin integrity. The patient underwent neurosurgical procedures (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy, laminectomy, fusion) on 10/30. There are multiple risk factors for GI bleed, including high-dose steroids, IV toradol, age, and NSAID use. She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and IV pantoprazole bolus+drip. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed ulcers c/w NSAID use. She is NPO and holding tube feeds. Her Hct is stable. She will continue on IV pantoprazole and be monitored closely. She has possible developing right lower lobe pneumonia, and her pain has improved. She has resolved acute renal failure and a rash that has vastly improved. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are stable, and she has peripheral edema with crackles b/l bases. She is currently intubated and sedated, pending decreased swelling in the cervical spine and completion of spinal surgeries to wash out her spine."

   abx and on steroid taper being transferred back from floor to MICU for
   new melena/UGIB.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.
   It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been spiking
   temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender abd and
   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c
ed [**10-29**].  Started decadron
   6q6 on [**10-23**], then on pred taper, which was discontinued.
   - Underwent neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage,
   corpectomy, laminectomy, fusion) on [**10-30**]
   - Plan for repeat NS on [**11-2**] (NPO post MN)
   - f/u NS recs
   - f/u MRI thoracic spine (scheduled today at 1pm) with contrast
   - f/u read of MRI lumbar spine (from evening of [**10-31**])
   - f/u ID recs
   - Per ID, TEE intra-op or while intubated given CXR showed evidence of
   septic emboli
 was not done during surgery, will d/w anesthesia today
   regarding potential for [**11-2**]
s surgery; ID notes that this can be put
   on hold for now, given cervical spine status
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess
   - f/u cultures
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - Pt is intubated and sedated for now, pending decreased swelling in
   the cervical spine and completion of spinal surgeries to wash out her
   spine.
   - continue fentanyl for pain control
   .
   # BP/Volume status:
   -  Wean down levo, goal MAP >65
   - Aim to keep UO >25 cc/hour, can bolus IVF prn to keep this level of
   UO maintained today; hold lasix today as pre-op (even though has
   peripheral edema)
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - Tube feeds restarted today
   - s/p pantoprazole gtt; now on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hct stable; check daily Hct
   - f/u GI recs
    .
   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, per recent
   films. Clinically, pt had low-grade temp, but without cough or other
   respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever curve, and
   get sputum cultures if cough develops.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - Pt is sedated and intubated for now, pending completion of spine
   surgeries; can re-start morphine PCA when pt is extubated.
   - Fentanyl for pain control for now
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.
   .
   # Thrush: no c/o esophageal/swalling pain so likely limited to OP
   - nystatin s/s
   .
   # Yeast infection: miconazole powder. consider fluconazole if not
   improved by [**10-29**]
   .
   #. Rash: vastly improved.
   - treat infection as above
   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .
   #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above)
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics, improved
   .
   # Peripheral edema: Got lasix [**10-19**] [**12-25**] o2 req and crackles b/l bases
   on exam and this resulted in rising Cr.  Pt
s baseline Albumin 1.9 on
   admission.
   - maximize FEN
   - continue to monitor
   .
   FEN: Ok for tube feeds today, NPO post MN for surgery on [**11-2**].

   abx and on steroid taper being transferred back from floor to MICU for
   new melena/UGIB.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.
   It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been spiking
   temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender abd and
   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c
ed [**10-29**].  Started decadron
   6q6 on [**10-23**], then on pred taper, which was discontinued.  Underwent
   neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy,
   laminectomy, fusion) on [**12-24**]
   - To undergo L spine decompression for another epidural abscess [**11-2**]
   at 4pm
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u NS recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u final read of MRI spine
   - Will hold on TEE given patient
s management will not change based on
   results and will be high risk given cervical collar
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - Pt is intubated and sedated for now, pending decreased swelling in
   the cervical spine and completion of spinal surgeries to wash out her
   spine.
   - continue fentanyl for pain control
   .
   # BP/Volume status:
   -  Wean down levo, goal MAP >65
   - Volume overloaded, but will hold Lasix today given pt is pre-op, and
   will consider diuresis tomorrow following her procedure.  Hold IVF if
   possible.
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - s/p pantoprazole gtt; now on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hct stable; check daily Hct
   - f/u GI recs
   .
   Less active issues:
    .
   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, per recent
   films. Clinically, pt had low-grade temp, but without cough or other
   respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever curve, and
   get sputum cultures if cough develops.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - Pt is sedated and intubated for now, pending completion of spine
   surgeries; can re-start morphine PCA when pt is extubated.
   - Fentanyl for pain control for now
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.
   .
   # Thrush: no c/o esophageal/swalling pain so likely limited to OP
   - nystatin s/s
   .
   # Yeast infection: miconazole powder. consider fluconazole if not
   improved by [**10-29**]
   .
   #. Rash: vastly improved.
   - treat infection as above
   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .
   #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above)
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics, improved
   .
   # Peripheral edema: Got lasix [**10-19**] [**12-25**] o2 req and crackles b/l bases
   on exam and this resulted in rising Cr.  Pt
s baseline Albumin 1.9 on
   admission.
   - maximize FEN
   - continue to monitor
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain who was found to have MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscesses. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroid taper. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and now presents with melena/upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She is being transferred back to the MICU for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Epidural Abscesses: The patient has epidural abscesses that appear to be caused by staphylococcus aureus infection. This can lead to spinal cord compression and neurological deficits if not promptly treated.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on dialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function due to factors such as dehydration, use of nephrotoxic medications, or complications related to surgery.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluid status, as indicated by the laboratory results. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other systemic complications.
4. Pain Control: The patient requires effective pain management due to her chronic back pain and recent surgical procedures. Opioids such as fentanyl are being used for pain control, but there is a risk of opioid-related complications such as respiratory depression and constipation.
5. Gastrointestinal Ble"

   65F with h/o chronic back pain found to have MSSA bacteremia and
   epidural abcesses with concern for cord compression on broad spectrum
   abx and on steroid taper being transferred back from floor to MICU for
   new melena/UGIB.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.
   It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been spiking
   temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender abd and
   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c
ed [**10-29**].  Started decadron
   6q6 on [**10-23**], then on pred taper, which was discontinued.
   - Underwent neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage,
   corpectomy, laminectomy, fusion) on [**12-24**]
   - To undergo L spine decompression for another epidural abscess [**11-2**]
   at 4pm
   - f/u NS recs
   - f/u MRI thoracic spine (scheduled today at 1pm) with contrast
   - f/u read of MRI lumbar spine (from evening of [**10-31**])
   - f/u ID recs
   - Per ID, TEE intra-op or while intubated given CXR showed evidence of
   septic emboli
 was not done during surgery, will d/w anesthesia today
   regarding potential for [**11-2**]
s surgery; ID notes that this can be put
   on hold for now, given cervical spine status
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess
   - f/u cultures
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - Pt is intubated and sedated for now, pending decreased swelling in
   the cervical spine and completion of spinal surgeries to wash out her
   spine.
   - continue fentanyl for pain control
   .
   # BP/Volume status:
   -  Wean down levo, goal MAP >65
   - Aim to keep UO >25 cc/hour, can bolus IVF prn to keep this level of
   UO maintained today; hold lasix today as pre-op (even though has
   peripheral edema)
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - Tube feeds restarted today
   - s/p pantoprazole gtt; now on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hct stable; check daily Hct
   - f/u GI recs
    .
   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, per recent
   films. Clinically, pt had low-grade temp, but without cough or other
   respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever curve, and
   get sputum cultures if cough develops.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - Pt is sedated and intubated for now, pending completion of spine
   surgeries; can re-start morphine PCA when pt is extubated.
   - Fentanyl for pain control for now
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.
   .
   # Thrush: no c/o esophageal/swalling pain so likely limited to OP
   - nystatin s/s
   .
   # Yeast infection: miconazole powder. consider fluconazole if not
   improved by [**10-29**]
   .
   #. Rash: vastly improved.
   - treat infection as above
   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .
   #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above)
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics, improved
   .
   # Peripheral edema: Got lasix [**10-19**] [**12-25**] o2 req and crackles b/l bases
   on exam and this resulted in rising Cr.  Pt
s baseline Albumin 1.9 on
   admission.
   - maximize FEN
   - continue to monitor
   .
   FEN: Ok for tube feeds today, NPO post MN for surgery on [**11-2**].
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI. IV vitamin K [**11-1**], 3 days of PO

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain who was found to have MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscesses. She is currently in the ICU for new melena/upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and tender abdomen. Her chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusions. She is intubated and sedated for now, pending decreased swelling in the cervical spine and completion of spinal surgeries to wash out her spine.

The patient has several medical complications including renal failure, electrolyte/fluid disorder, pain control, gastrointestinal bleed, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, and hip pain. She also has a history of ARF, thrush, yeast infection, rash, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), tachycardia, and peripheral edema.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal Failure: Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess.
2. Back Pain: Underwent neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy, laminectomy, fusion) on [**12-24**]. To undergo L spine decompression for another epidural abscess [**11-2**] at 4pm.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old woman with multiple MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) infection sites, including paraspinal abscesses and osteomyelitis. She has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, which has now been resolved. The patient's current medical conditions include renal failure (end-stage renal disease), electrolyte and fluid disorder, pain control, gastrointestinal bleed (resolved), fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure.

The patient's recent events include a thoracic spine MRI showing smaller collection at T4, stable collection at T7, and evidence of osteo/discitis. She underwent a cervical procedure earlier this week and is scheduled for surgery today to evacuate a lumbar collection. She is currently receiving continuous nafcillin infusion.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
- Heart rate: 99 bpm (76-116 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 128/62 mmHg (82-194/127 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 0 insp/min (0-19 insp/min)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient is intubated and sedated, with mechanical ventilation support. Her respiratory parameters include a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 16, peak inspiratory pressure of 36 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 14 cmH2O, compliance of 50 cmH2O/mL, and oxygenation of 240 PaO2/FiO2 ratio.

Her physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, bilateral lower extremity edema, and warm skin. Neurological examination is not assessed due to sedation and intubation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate, and lactic acid levels. Blood cultures have grown coag-positive staphylococci. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, persistent pain, respiratory complications due to mechanical ventilation, gastrointestinal bleeding recurrence, fever of unknown origin, and impaired skin integrity."

   1. Epidural abscesses are identified at the upper thoracic spine
   involving the levels of T1, T2, and T3, apparently slightly smaller
   since the
   prior examination, however, there is persistent enhancement surrounding
   the
   thecal sac and the spinal cord.
   2. No evidence of abnormal signal within the thoracic spinal cord.
   3. Epidural abscess is again demonstrated at the level of T7/T8,
   causing
   anterior thecal sac deformity and also demonstrating pattern of
   enhancement.
   4. Heterogeneous signal is again redemonstrated in the bone marrow,
   likely
   consistent with a combination of osteomyelitis/discitis.
   5. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions.

   neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy,
   laminectomy, fusion) on [**10-30**] (cervical), [**11-2**] (lumbar-sacral).
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess; added on
   gentamycin on [**11-2**] per ID (likely 5 day course, at 1mg/kg tid dosing,
   check peak/trough today before 4^th dose)
   - f/u cultures

   - s/p surgery yesterday, with Hct decrease this AM, check afternoon Hct
   - Will hold on TEE given patient
s management will not change based on
   results and will be high risk given cervical collar
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.

   to wash out her spine can plan for extubation today from spine team
   perspective
   - plan to extubate today ([**11-3**])
   - continue fentanyl for pain control (gtt and patch); plan for morphine
   PCA and fentanyl patch cont once extubated

   bacterial infection
   - etiology unclear; consider causes for immunosuppression (HIV test

   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.

   Less active issues:
    .
   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, seen in
   recent CXR
s. Clinically, pt has had low-grade temp, but without cough
   or other respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever
   curve, and get sputum cultures if cough develops. Monitor resp status
   s/p extubation today.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - Pt is sedated and intubated for now, pending completion of spine
   surgeries; can re-start morphine PCA when pt is extubated.
   - Fentanyl for pain control for now (gtt and patch)
   - discuss w/patient once extubated; controlled for now

   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.

   #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above)
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics, improved

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, MSSA bacteremia, and epidural abscesses. She underwent neurosurgical procedures including epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy, laminectomy, and fusion. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently intubated and sedated, with plans for extubation today. Her pain is being managed with fentanyl for now, and morphine PCA will be initiated once extubated. She also has peripheral edema, which is being treated with lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently experiencing fluid overload, indicating possible renal dysfunction.
2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in potassium, sodium, and chloride levels, which may require close monitoring and correction.
3. Pain control: The patient requires effective pain management due to her chronic back pain and recent surgical procedures.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has melena and an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which needs further evaluation and management.
5. Pneumonia: There is a possibility of developing right lower lobe pneumonia, which should be monitored closely.
6. Thrush and yeast infections: The patient has limited oral thrush and a yeast infection on her skin, which require treatment.
7. Peripheral edema: The"

   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess; added on
   gentamycin on [**11-2**] per ID (likely 5 day course, at 1mg/kg tid dosing,
   check peak/trough today before 4^th dose)
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u NS recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Will hold on TEE given patient
s management will not change based on
   results and will be high risk given cervical collar
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - Pt is intubated and sedated, now s/p completion of spinal surgeries
   to wash out her spine can plan for extubation today from spine team
   perspective
   - continue fentanyl for pain control (gtt and patch); plan for morphine
   PCA and fentanyl patch cont once extubated
   .
   # BP/Volume status:
   - Volume overloaded, but will hold Lasix today given pt is immediately
   post-op, and will consider diuresis tomorrow. Hold IVF if possible.
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - s/p pantoprazole gtt; now on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hct stable; check daily Hct
   - f/u GI recs
   .
   Less active issues:
    .
   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, per recent
   films. Clinically, pt had low-grade temp, but without cough or other
   respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever curve, and
   get sputum cultures if cough develops.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - Pt is sedated and intubated for now, pending completion of spine
   surgeries; can re-start morphine PCA when pt is extubated.
   - Fentanyl for pain control for now
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.
   .
   # Thrush: no c/o esophageal/swalling pain so likely limited to OP
   - nystatin s/s
   .
   # Yeast infection: miconazole powder. consider fluconazole if not
   improved by [**10-29**]
   .
   #. Rash: vastly improved.
   - treat infection as above
   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .
   #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above)
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics, improved
   .
   # Peripheral edema: Got lasix [**10-19**] [**12-25**] o2 req and crackles b/l bases
   on exam and this resulted in rising Cr.  Pt
s baseline Albumin 1.9 on
   admission.
   - maximize FEN
   - continue to monitor
   .
   FEN: NPO for surgery on [**11-2**].

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with multiple MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) infections, including cervical and lumbar epidural abscesses. She underwent a bone marrow intraoperative procedure to evaluate a possible immunodeficiency. The patient is currently receiving nafcillin and gentamicin as part of her antibiotic treatment.

The patient's current medical conditions include renal failure (end-stage renal disease), back pain, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pain control (acute and chronic), upper gastrointestinal bleed, fever of unknown origin, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C
- Heart rate: 109 bpm
- Blood pressure: 143/66 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100%
- Sinus rhythm

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 300, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 5.7 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination is incomplete due to the patient's intubation.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 20.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hct) level of 25.4%, and thrombocytosis with a platelet (Plt) count of 496 K/uL. Renal function tests show elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, while liver function tests are within normal limits. Other lab values are also provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Epidural abscess: The patient underwent surgical evacuation of the lumbar epidural abscess.
2. Renal failure, end-stage: The patient has chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis.
3. Back pain: Pain management is ongoing.
4. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: Ongoing management of electrolyte imbalances and fluid status.
5. Pain control: Transitioning from intravenous fentanyl to a fentanyl patch for post-extubation pain control.
6. Gastrointestinal bleed, upper: Monitoring for any further bleeding events.
7. Fever, unknown origin: Investigation and management of persistent fever.
8. Impaired skin integrity: Monitoring and appropriate wound care.

 EPIDUARL ABSCESS
 BACK PAIN
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   65F with h/o chronic back pain found to have MSSA bacteremia and
   epidural abcesses with concern for cord compression on broad spectrum
   abx and on steroid taper being transferred back from floor to MICU for
   new melena/UGIB.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.
   It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been spiking
   temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender abd and
   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c
ed [**10-29**].  Started decadron
   6q6 on [**10-23**], then on pred taper, which was discontinued.  Underwent
   neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy,
   laminectomy, fusion) on [**10-30**] (cervical), [**11-2**] (lumbar-sacral).
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess; added on
   gentamycin on [**11-2**] per ID (likely 5 day course, at 1mg/kg tid dosing,
   peak/trough as above, decreased dose from 70mg Q8hr to 60mg Q8hr)
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u NS recs

   - Will hold on TEE given patient
s management will not change based on
   results and will be high risk given cervical collar and recent cervical
   surgery
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - pt extubated on without complications ([**11-3**])
   - on Fentanyl patch and morphine IV boluses for pain
   - once extubated, if stable, plan to pull a-line and central line given
   bacterial infection

   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.

   recent CXR
s. Clinically, pt has had low-grade temp, but without cough
   or other respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever
   curve, and get sputum cultures if cough develops. Monitor resp status
   s/p extubation today.

   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - Pt is sedated and intubated for now, pending completion of spine
   surgeries.
   - Fentanyl and morphine boluses for pain
   - discuss w/patient once extubated; controlled for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, who was found to have MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscesses with concern for cord compression. She was on broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids before being transferred back to the MICU for new melena/UGIB.
- The patient underwent neurosurgical procedures (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy, laminectomy, fusion) on 10/30 (cervical) and 11/2 (lumbar-sacral).
- The patient was extubated on 11/3 without complications and is currently on fentanyl patch and morphine IV boluses for pain management.
- The patient's abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleed are still being monitored. She is receiving IV pantoprazole and has been given 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
- The patient has a possible developing right lower lobe pneumonia seen in recent chest X-ray. She has low-grade fever but no respiratory issues. Monitoring vitals, fever curve, and sputum cultures is ongoing.
- The patient has diffuse pain where her body touches the bed, and hip pain is different from sciatic pain. A hip CT was unremarkable.
- The patient's renal function has improved, and she is no longer in acute renal failure.
- Thrush and yeast infections are improving with appropriate treatment.
- The rash has vastly improved.
- The patient's liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, MSSA bacteremia, and epidural abscesses. She is currently in the ICU for new melena/upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids for her condition. She underwent neurosurgical procedures (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy, laminectomy, fusion) on 10/30 (cervical) and 11/2 (lumbar-sacral). The patient was extubated successfully on 11/3. She has multiple medical complications, including potential pneumonia, pain, acute renal failure (ARF), thrush, yeast infection, rash, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), tachycardia, and peripheral edema. The patient is now being monitored closely for any changes in her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a possible developing right lower lobe pneumonia seen on recent chest X-ray. She has had low-grade fever but no respiratory symptoms. It is important to monitor her vital signs, fever curve, and obtain sputum cultures if cough develops.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing melena, which indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently receiving intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and pantoprazole. Further evaluation with an upper endoscopy is needed to identify the source"

 EPIDUARL ABSCESS
 BACK PAIN
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   65F with h/o chronic back pain found to have MSSA bacteremia and
   epidural abcesses with concern for cord compression on broad spectrum
   abx and on steroid taper being transferred back from floor to MICU for
   new melena/UGIB.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.
   It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been spiking
   temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender abd and
   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c
ed [**10-29**].  Started decadron
   6q6 on [**10-23**], then on pred taper, which was discontinued.  Underwent
   neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy,
   laminectomy, fusion) on [**10-30**] (cervical), [**11-2**] (lumbar-sacral).
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess; added on
   gentamycin on [**11-2**] per ID (likely 5 day course, at 1mg/kg tid dosing,
   peak/trough as above, decreased dose from 70mg Q8hr to 60mg Q8hr)
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u NS recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - daily HCTs
   - Will hold on TEE given patient
s management will not change based on
   results and will be high risk given cervical collar and recent cervical
   surgery
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - pt extubated on without complications ([**11-3**])
   - on Fentanyl patch and morphine IV boluses for pain
   - once extubated, if stable, plan to pull a-line and central line given
   bacterial infection
   - etiology unclear; consider causes for immunosuppression (HIV test
   once consentable, SPEP, UPEP, cbc with diff, flow cytometry, smear, f/u
   bone marrow biopsy results (done intra-op on [**11-2**]).
   - Obtain consent for HIV
   .
   # BP/Volume status:
   - Volume overloaded, but given slight elevation of Cr and use of Gent,
   will hold off on diuresis for now
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - now on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]; s/p pantoprazole gtt
   - Hct stable; check daily Hct
   - f/u GI recs
   .
   Less active issues:
    .
   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, seen in
   recent CXR
s. Clinically, pt has had low-grade temp, but without cough
   or other respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever
   curve, and get sputum cultures if cough develops. Monitor resp status
   s/p extubation today.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - well controlled on fentanyl patch and morphine boluses for pain
   - improve bowel reg: Goal BM today.
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.
   .
   # Thrush: no c/o esophageal/swalling pain so likely limited to OP.
   Improving.
   - nystatin s/s
   .
   # Yeast infection: miconazole powder. Improving.
   .
   #. Rash: vastly improved.
   - treat infection as above
   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .  #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting
   of dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above)
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics, improved
   .
   # Peripheral edema: Got lasix [**10-19**] [**12-25**] O2 req and crackles b/l bases
   on exam and this resulted in rising Cr.  Pt
s baseline Albumin 1.9 on
   admission.
   - maximize FEN; hope to start PO once extubated
   - 20 IV lasix on [**11-3**]
   .
   FEN: regular diet w. boost supplementation; goal BM today.
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI. C-collar x 8wks [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) **] spine.
   Start heparin SQ. Place PT consult.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with multiple MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) infection sites, including cervical and lumbar abscesses. She underwent a bone marrow intraoperative procedure to investigate possible immunodeficiency. The patient is currently receiving nafcillin and gentamicin therapy, although the gentamicin doses are being held today due to high trough levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metastatic MSSA infection: The patient has multiple MSSA infection sites, including cervical and lumbar abscesses. There is a risk of further spread or worsening of these infections.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated but is now extubated. However, she is still on invasive ventilation support. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilation support is not adequately managed.
3. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which indicates severe kidney dysfunction. This can lead to complications related to fluid and electrolyte imbalance, as well as the accumulation of waste products in the body.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels such as sodium, potassium, and chloride. Additionally, there is a significant fluid balance deficit of 727 mL over the past 24 hours. These findings suggest an electrolyte and fluid disorder that needs to be addressed.
5. Back pain: The patient has back pain,"

   65F with h/o chronic back pain found to have MSSA bacteremia and
   epidural abcesses with concern for cord compression on broad spectrum
   abx and on steroid taper being transferred back from floor to MICU for
   new melena/UGIB.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.
   It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been spiking
   temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender abd and
   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c
ed [**10-29**].  Started decadron
   6q6 on [**10-23**], then on pred taper, which was discontinued.  Underwent
   neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy,
   laminectomy, fusion) on [**10-30**] (cervical), [**11-2**] (lumbar-sacral).
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess; added on
   gentamycin on [**11-2**] per ID (likely 5 day course, at 1mg/kg tid dosing,
   peak/trough as above, decreased dose from 70mg Q8hr to 60mg Q8hr); f/u
   peak/trough today
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u NS recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Will hold on TEE given patient
s management will not change based on
   results and will be high risk given cervical collar and recent cervical
   surgery
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - pt extubated without complications ([**11-3**])
   - on Fentanyl patch and morphine IV q4h prn for pain
   - once extubated, if stable, plan to pull central line given bacterial
   infection
   - etiology unclear; consider causes for immunosuppression (HIV test
   once consentable, SPEP, UPEP, f/u bone marrow biopsy results (done
   intra-op on [**11-2**]).
   - Obtain consent for HIV
   .
   # BP/Volume status:
   - Volume overloaded, give 20 IV lasix today; goal neutral to -500cc
   today (gentle diuresis, given gentamycin
s nephrotoxicity)
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - now on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]; s/p pantoprazole gtt
   - Hct stable; check daily Hct
   - f/u GI recs
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above), perhaps abscess on heart, perhaps PE post-op.
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics
   - f/u EKG
   .
   Less active issues:
    .
   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, seen in
   recent CXR
s. Clinically, pt has had low-grade temp, but without cough
   or other respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever
   curve, and get sputum cultures if cough develops. Monitor resp status
   s/p extubation.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - well controlled on fentanyl patch and morphine IV prn for pain
   - improve bowel reg: Goal BM today.
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.
   .
   # Thrush: no c/o esophageal/swalling pain so likely limited to OP.
   Improving.
   - nystatin s/s
   .
   # Yeast infection: miconazole powder. Improving.
   .
   #. Rash: vastly improved.
   - treat infection as above
   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .  #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting
   of dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   # Peripheral edema: Got lasix [**10-19**] [**12-25**] O2 req and crackles b/l bases
   on exam and this resulted in rising Cr.  Pt

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain who was found to have MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscesses. The patient has undergone several surgeries, including neurosurgical procedures for the epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy, laminectomy, and fusion. The patient also has a history of renal failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, and other medical conditions.

The patient's recent events include stopping nafcillin and starting vancomycin and cefepime due to suspicion of staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient's pain is well-controlled with fentanyl patch and morphine IV prn. The patient's volume status is overloaded, and they will be given 20 IV lasix today to aim for neutral to -500cc fluid balance. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding has been managed with IV PPI bolus and drip, and they are now on pantoprazole gtt. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to low-grade fever or possibly a new source of infection.

Other less active issues include possible developing right lower lobe pneumonia, pain, acute renal failure, thrush, yeast infection, rash, elevated liver function tests, and peripheral edema. The patient's fluid electrolyte balance is also mentioned, with a focus on managing fluid overload and ensuring appropriate electrolyte levels.

   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c

   neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy,
   laminectomy, fusion) on [**10-30**] (cervical), [**11-2**] (lumbar-sacral).
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess; added on
   gentamycin on [**11-2**] per ID (likely 5 day course, at 1mg/kg tid dosing,
   peak/trough as above, decreased dose from 70mg Q8hr to 60mg Q8hr); f/u

   - Will hold on TEE given patient
s management will not change based on

   surgery
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - pt extubated without complications ([**11-3**])
   - on Fentanyl patch and morphine IV q4h prn for pain

   infection
   - etiology unclear; consider causes for immunosuppression (HIV test
   once consentable, SPEP, UPEP, f/u bone marrow biopsy results (done
   intra-op on [**11-2**]).
   - Obtain consent for HIV
   .
   # BP/Volume status:
   - Volume overloaded, give 20 IV lasix today; goal neutral to -500cc
   today (gentle diuresis, given gentamycin
s nephrotoxicity)
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - now on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]; s/p pantoprazole gtt
   - Hct stable; check daily Hct

   Less active issues:

   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, seen in
   recent CXR
s. Clinically, pt has had low-grade temp, but without cough
   or other respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever
   curve, and get sputum cultures if cough develops. Monitor resp status
   s/p extubation.

   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - well controlled on fentanyl patch and morphine IV prn for pain
   - improve bowel reg: Goal BM today.

   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.

   - treat infection as above
   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .  #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting
   of dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, MSSA bacteremia, and epidural abscesses. She was previously on broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids but is now experiencing new symptoms, including melena/upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), tachycardia, and possible pneumonia. The patient underwent neurosurgical procedures for epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy, laminectomy, and fusion. She is currently on multiple medications, including nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia, gentamicin, vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, fentanyl patch, and morphine IV for pain management. The patient's volume status is overloaded, and she has been prescribed diuretics. She also has peripheral edema, which is being managed with lasix. The patient's renal function is impaired, and she has an elevated lactate level. Her nutritional status is a concern, and she is expected to start a regular diet with Ensure supplementation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscesses, which require continued antibiotic therapy. There is also a concern for new sources of infection, such as pneumonia or endocarditis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has melena and UGIB, indicating potential bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Further investigation and management are needed to identify and control the source of bleeding.

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain who was found to have MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscesses with concern for cord compression. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids. The patient is currently in the ICU for new melena/upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and has undergone multiple neurosurgical procedures, including epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy, laminectomy, and fusion.

The patient's medical conditions include alterations in nutrition, renal failure (end-stage), back pain, electrolyte & fluid disorder, pain control, gastrointestinal bleed, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, and possible pneumonia. She also has multiple less active issues, including thrush, yeast infection, rash, elevated liver function tests, peripheral edema, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 140/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.8 x 10^9/L, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 467 x 10^9/L.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with multiple MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) infections. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated with nafcillin and gentamicin for her infections. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 144/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal head, ears, nose, and throat, hyperdynamic cardiovascular system, clear breath sounds, non-tender and distended abdomen, right and left lower extremity edema, and warm skin. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, low sodium and potassium levels, high blood glucose level, and abnormal liver function test results. 

The patient's medical complications include anemia, tachycardia, potential renal failure (end-stage renal disease), electrolyte and fluid disorder, pain control issues, gastrointestinal bleeding, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, and metastatic MSSA infection with abscesses in the cervical and lumbar regions. 

The plan includes continuing the current antibiotics, monitoring drug levels, and following up with an intraoperative bone marrow biopsy"

   new melena/UGIB.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.
   It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been spiking
   temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender abd and
   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c
ed [**10-29**].  Started decadron
   6q6 on [**10-23**], then on pred taper, which was discontinued.  Underwent
   neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy,
   laminectomy, fusion) on [**10-30**] (cervical), [**11-2**] (lumbar-sacral).
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess; added on
   gentamycin on [**11-2**] per ID (likely 5 day course, at 1mg/kg tid dosing,
   peak/trough as above, decreased dose from 70mg Q8hr to 60mg Q8hr); f/u
   peak/trough today
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u NS recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Will hold on TEE given patient
s management will not change based on
   results and will be high risk given cervical collar and recent cervical
   surgery
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - pt extubated without complications ([**11-3**])
   - on Fentanyl patch and morphine IV q4h prn for pain
   - once extubated, if stable, plan to pull central line given bacterial
   infection
   - etiology unclear; consider causes for immunosuppression (HIV test
   once consentable, SPEP, UPEP, f/u bone marrow biopsy results (done
   intra-op on [**11-2**]).
   - Obtain consent for HIV
   .
   # BP/Volume status:
   - Volume overloaded, give 20 IV lasix today; goal neutral to -500cc
   today (gentle diuresis, given gentamycin
s nephrotoxicity)
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - now on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]; s/p pantoprazole gtt
   - Hct stable; check daily Hct
   - f/u GI recs
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above), perhaps abscess on heart, perhaps PE post-op.
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics
   - f/u EKG
   .
   Less active issues:
    .
   # Pneumonia: There is possibly a developing RLL pneumonia, seen in
   recent CXR
s. Clinically, pt has had low-grade temp, but without cough
   or other respiratory issues.   Will continue to monitor vitals, fever
   curve, and get sputum cultures if cough develops. Monitor resp status
   s/p extubation.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - well controlled on fentanyl patch and morphine IV prn for pain
   - improve bowel reg: Goal BM today.
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently resolved.  ANCA
   and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies negative.
   .
   # Thrush: no c/o esophageal/swalling pain so likely limited to OP.
   Improving.
   - nystatin s/s

   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, MSSA bacteremia, and epidural abscesses. She has undergone neurosurgical procedures to drain the abscesses and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient is currently in the ICU due to new melena/UGIB, tachycardia, and possible pneumonia. She has multiple medical complications including renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorders, pain control issues, impaired skin integrity, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently experiencing renal failure. This could be due to various factors such as dehydration, nephrotoxic medications, or sepsis.
2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorders: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium levels. These imbalances can lead to various complications like cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms.
3. Pain Control Issues: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain due to her epidural abscesses and previous surgeries. Poor pain control can lead to increased stress, agitation, and potential complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to immobility and pressure ulcers. This increases the risk of infection and potential complications.

   65F with h/o chronic back pain found to have MSSA bacteremia and
   epidural abcesses with concern for cord compression on broad spectrum
   abx and on steroid taper being transferred back from floor to MICU for
   new melena/UGIB.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.
   It does not have the appearance of metastasis. Pt has been spiking
   temps last night to 101.8 and remains tachycardic. Now c tender abd and
   cxr shows cannot r/o bl pna. WBC count up for past 2 days. Husband
   called and informed.  Repeat MRI shows organizing phlegmon into
   abscesses, no significant change in cord compression or neurologic sx.
   Nafcillin discontinued o/n and started on vanc/cefepime, cefepime
   increased to meningitis dosing and added flagyl [**12-25**] ? abd source.
   Nafcillin re-started and Vanc/Cefepime d/c
ed [**10-29**].  Started decadron
   6q6 on [**10-23**], then on pred taper, which was discontinued.  Underwent
   neurosurgical procedure (epidural abscess drainage, corpectomy,
   laminectomy, fusion) on [**10-30**] (cervical), [**11-2**] (lumbar-sacral). Pt
   extubated without complications ([**11-3**])
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess; added on
   gentamycin on [**11-2**] per ID (course completed on [**11-5**]; no additional
   dose given on [**11-6**] per ID based upon AM level)
   - d/c gentamycin
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u NS recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Will hold on TEE given patient
s management will not change based on
   results and will be high risk given cervical collar and recent cervical
   surgery
   - consider ophtho consult for ? emboli to eyes  - will hold off until
   acute epidural abscess issue/surgeries complete.
   - on Fentanyl patch and morphine IV q4h prn for pain
   - etiology unclear; consider causes for immunosuppression (HIV test
   once consentable, SPEP, UPEP, f/u bone marrow biopsy results (done
   intra-op on [**11-2**]).
   - Obtain consent for HIV
   - s/p fall to face, recheck with radiology re: imaging of head, whether
   sinus disease as potential source is possible
   .
   # GI bleed, abd discomfort - Multiple risk factors: on high dose
   steroids, received IV toradol 30 mg x 1, age. Was on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] but
   began to have melenic stools. Received 1u pRBC and IV PPI bolus + drip
   on floor; remained hemodynamically stable. Hct bumped appropriately in
   response to transfusion. GI consulted; feels that patient is too high
   risk for scope in outpatient suites, and will need scope either in [**Hospital Ward Name **] under general anesthesia or in ICU setting.   EGD showed ulcers
   c/w NSAID use.
   - now on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]; s/p pantoprazole gtt
   - Hct stable; check daily Hct
   - f/u GI recs
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, perhaps new source of
   infection (see above), perhaps abscess on heart, perhaps PE post-op.
   EKG sinus tachy but without evidence for right heart strain.
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics; pain control
   .
   # Peripheral edema (upper and lower extremities): Pt
s baseline Albumin
   1.9 on admission.
   - maximize FEN
   - 20 IV lasix this morning; goal negative 1L
   - pm lytes check (patient has needed significant K repletion over past
   day)
   .
   Less active issues:
    .
   # Pneumonia: Issue resolved clinically. There is possibly a developing
   RLL pneumonia, seen in recent CXR
s. Clinically, pt has had low-grade
   temp, but without cough or other respiratory issues.   Will continue to
   monitor vitals, fever curve, and get sputum cultures if cough develops.
   Monitor resp status s/p extubation. Oxygenating well, without pneumonia
   signs/symptoms.
   .
   # Pain: pt has diffuse pain where her body hits bed. Pt states hip pain
   is different from her sciatic pain (which has not been bothering her in
   the hospital.).   Hip CT unremarkable.
   - well controlled on fentanyl patch and morphine IV prn for pain
   - bowel regimen
   .
   #. ARF: Resolved. Likely pre-renal in initial etiology, currently
   resolved.  ANCA and RMSF negative. babesia and anaplasma serologies
   negative.
   .
   # Thrush: no c/o esophageal/swalling pain so likely limited to OP.
   Improving.
   - nystatin s/s
   .
   # Yeast infection: miconazole powder. Improving.
   .
   #. Rash: vastly improved.
   - treat infection as above
   - biopsy results of odd lesion on back: ""necrotizing arteritis with
   epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy of back..."" derm feels this is most
   llikely reactive and does not require further w/u
   .
    #. Elevated LFTs: stable. Perhaps from poor perfusion in the setting
   of dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS. RUQ showed
   gallbladder was distended, but no other significant findings.
   .
   FEN: tubefeeds; s/p IR-guided Dobhoff placed on [**11-5**], having BM

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with multiple MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) infection sites. She has undergone drainage of cervical and lumbar collections and has completed a course of nafcillin and gentamicin. The patient is currently being monitored in the ICU for various medical complications. Her vital signs are stable, but she has persistent tachycardia. Her blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but her renal function is impaired. She also has anemia, and her nutritional status needs to be assessed. The patient's pain is well-controlled, and she has no fever. She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, skin integrity issues, and fever of unknown origin. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain control, and prophylactic measures. She is currently on a glucose control regimen. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor once stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has impaired renal function, which may lead to complications such as fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased risk of infections, and difficulty in eliminating waste products.
2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but her renal function impairment puts her at risk for developing electrolyte imbalances and fluid disorders"
