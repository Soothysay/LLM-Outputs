   HPI:
   43W history of EtOH and IVDA admitted yesterday with nausea, vomiting
   and found to be in liver and renal failure. Apparently has been
   drinking more than usual recently. Has also been taking excessive
   tylenol and vicodan. Ast found to be 21k and Alt 6k and TBili 4.7,
   creatinine 3.8. Tox screen positive for tylenol and salicylates and RUQ
   U/S unremarkable.
   n-AC started along with ativan and she was transferred. Currently
   sleepy, complaining of vague chest pain.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is liver failure. They have a history of EtOH (ethanol) abuse and IVDA (intravenous drug abuse). The patient was admitted with nausea and vomiting and was found to be in liver and renal failure. They have been drinking more than usual recently and taking excessive amounts of Tylenol and Vicodan. The laboratory results show elevated levels of AST (21k), ALT (6k), and bilirubin (4.7), as well as elevated creatinine levels (3.8). The tox screen is positive for Tylenol and salicylates. The RUQ ultrasound is unremarkable.

The patient is currently sleepy and complaining of vague chest pain. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 158/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has sinus tachycardia on the ECG.

The physical examination reveals tender upper abdomen and clear breath sounds. The neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's unresponsive state. The patient's labs show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dL, elevated leukocyte count of 152 K/uL, and normal platelet count of 137 mg/dL. Other labs indicate elevated liver enzymes, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and abnormal blood gases. The CXR shows"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and intravenous drug use, presenting with liver and renal failure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of AST, ALT, and bilirubin, indicating liver damage. The patient also has elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment. The presence of tylenol and salicylates in the toxicology screen suggests possible overdose. The abdominal pain and tender upper abdomen may be indicative of liver inflammation or hepatomegaly.

The patient is currently receiving IV N-acetylcysteine (N-AC) for acetaminophen overdose and lorazepam for encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 112-158/90-97 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 98%. The patient's temperature is stable at 36.1Â°C.

The patient has conjunctival edema, joint pain, and abdominal pain on review of systems. Physical examination reveals periorbital edema, clear breath sounds, tender upper abdomen, and altered mental status with sleepiness.

Imaging shows right hilar fullness and patchy infiltrates in the right lower lobe of the lungs on chest X-ray. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia but is otherwise unremark"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with chronic alcohol use presenting with an overdose of Tylenol on top of chronic use. She has hepatic failure and anuric renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from NSAID and/or Tylenol use. The patient's liver function is improving with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), but renal dysfunction persists despite fluid challenges. The liver and renal teams are following up with her. She requires increasing amounts of oxygen, currently on 4 liters with a saturation level of 94%. A chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema, and she may need dialysis. A trial of lasix will be given. The patient will be monitored for withdrawal and benzodiazepines will be used based on the CIWA scale.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver is not functioning properly, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acute kidney injury.
3. Pulmonary edema: The presence of pulmonary edema indicates fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can compromise respiratory function and potentially lead to respiratory failure.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's worsening oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with chronic alcohol use who presented with a Tylenol overdose, leading to hepatic failure and anuric renal failure. The patient's liver function appears to be improving with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), but renal dysfunction persists despite fluid challenges. The patient is stable for transfer to the floor, where liver and renal teams will continue to monitor her. She may require dialysis while waiting for kidney function recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's acute liver failure, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can present with altered mental status and neurological symptoms.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: Due to the concurrent liver and renal failure, there is a possibility of developing hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure associated with liver disease.
3. Infections: Immunosuppression due to liver failure increases the risk of infections, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or nosocomial infections.
4. Coagulopathy: Liver failure can lead to impaired synthesis of clotting factors, resulting in coagulopathy and increased bleeding risk.
5. Hepatic hydrothorax: If the liver dysfunction worsens, it can cause transudative pleural effusion (hepatic hydrothorax), leading to respiratory distress.
6. Hepatomegaly with rupture: Severe liver damage may result in"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 7850**], a 43-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, IVDU, and hepatitis C, presented to Southern [**Hospital 254**] Medical Center with malaise, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was found to be in acute liver and kidney failure likely due to APAP toxicity and was transferred for further management. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 160/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been started on dialysis due to pulmonary edema.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated creatinine levels indicating kidney dysfunction, and abnormal coagulation parameters (PT/INR). The patient also has a positive hepatitis C viral load and a positive HAV Ab. A urine culture reveals the presence of gram-negative rods.

Assessment and plan include management of acute hepatitis, acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, alcoholism/polysubstance abuse, and hepatitis C. The patient is being monitored closely with serial abdominal exams, renal rechecks, and ongoing management of liver dysfunction. Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots for DVT prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening liver and kidney dysfunction, progression of pulmonary edema, development of further infections, and complications related to alcoholism and polysubstance abuse."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, presenting with an acetaminophen overdose and liver failure. She is currently experiencing oliguric acute renal failure and fluid overload, awaiting hemodialysis (HD). The patient's liver function is improving, but her long-term prognosis for renal function is uncertain. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36Â°C (96.8Â°F)
- Heart rate: 74 bpm (normal range: 71-111 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 178/97 mmHg (normal range: 90-119/70-79 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (normal range: 14-25 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on nasal cannula

Physical examination reveals crackles bibasilar and scattered wheezes in the respiratory system, and the patient has edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately, but movement, tone, and orientation are not assessed.

Laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 6.8 K/uL
- Platelet count: 152 K/uL
- Blood urea nitrogen: 55 mg/d"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of HCV and alcohol abuse. She presented with an acetaminophen (apap) overdose and liver failure, which is now improving. The patient also has oliguric acute renal failure (ARF) and fluid overload. She was started on hemodialysis (HD), which she tolerated well with 4 liters removed. Liver function is continuing to improve. The patient's hypoxia is secondary to fluid overload.

Medical Complications:

1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a confirmed E. coli UTI.
2. Hepatitis: The patient has acute toxic hepatitis, likely due to acetaminophen overdose and possible alcohol abuse.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, but it is not delirium.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has oliguric ARF, likely secondary to her liver failure and acetaminophen overdose.
5. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver function is abnormal due to the acetaminophen overdose and possible alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and liver failure, she may develop hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, altered level of consciousness, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Hepatitis C Progression: The"

   Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 7850**] is a 43 year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, IVDU,
   and hepatitis C who presented to Southern [**Hospital 254**] Medical Center on
   [**2200-8-18**] with malaise, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, was found
   to be in acute liver and kidney failure in the setting of likely APAP
   toxicity, and was transferred for further management.
   # Acute hepatitis:  [**1-27**] heavy APAP use, NSAIDs, underlying hepatitis C,
   and alcohol abuse.  Abd u/s with fatty infiltration, no Budd-Chiari.
   - trend LFTs
   - clarify interpretation of high serum iron and tibc (?hemachromatosis)
   - no steroids per liver fellow
   # Anemia: HCT from 35 to 27. Concerning for bleeding
   - guaiacs
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT, t/s+c, HCT>21 or >30 if active bleed.
   # Acute kidney injury: Likley HRS.
   - dialysis today given pulm edema
   - ? role of midodrine octreotide in setting of dialysis.
   - renaly dose meds
   - renal reccs
   # UTI: E Coli.
   - started cipro on [**8-20**] (today is day 3)
   # Abdominal pain:  complaining of diffuse abdominal pain and TTP in RUQ
   secondary to liver inflammation.  Low suspicion for infectious or
   ischemic etiology.
   - serial abdominal exams
   # Alcoholism/polysubstance abuse:  has prior history of withdrawal per
   family.  Was drinking heavily prior to admission.
   - thiamine and folate
   - will use CIWA but minimize benzos
   - social work reccs
   # Hepatitis C:  no prior history of treatment.  Likely contracted
   during prior history of IVDU.
   - management of liver dysfunction as above

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, intravenous drug use, and hepatitis C. She presented to the hospital with malaise, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was found to be in acute liver and kidney failure, likely due to acetaminophen toxicity, and was transferred to this hospital for further management.

She has several medical issues that need to be addressed:
1. Acute hepatitis: The patient has evidence of acute hepatitis, possibly caused by heavy acetaminophen use, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), underlying hepatitis C, and alcohol abuse. Her liver function tests (LFTs) should be trended, and further investigation into the high serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) should be done to rule out hemochromatosis. The use of steroids in the management of her liver condition should be discussed with a liver fellow.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has decreased from 35% to 27%, which is concerning for bleeding. Guaiac tests should be performed to check for gastrointestinal bleeding, and the patient should undergo further evaluation, including a complete blood count (CBC) and additional tests if indicated.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient likely has hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), as indicated by her acute kidney injury in the setting of liver failure. She underwent dialysis due to pulmonary edema. The role"

The patient's husband expressed concerns about not being able to contact the physician directly and only being able to reach out to the doctor instead.

The patient has allergies to codeine and an unknown medication. The last dose of antibiotics was not specified. The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications as noted.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the development of pulmonary edema, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute toxic hepatitis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and liver function abnormalities.

Vital signs show a temperature within normal range, heart rate within normal limits, blood pressure slightly elevated, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and there are no significant abnormalities noted on physical examination except for scleral and periorbital hemorrhages, bilateral wheezes, and distended abdomen with positive rebound in the right upper quadrant and left lower quadrant.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, liver enzymes, and lactate, while other values such as hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, and electrolytes are within normal ranges."

Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 7850**], a 43-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, intravenous drug use (IVDU), and hepatitis C, presented to Southern [**Hospital 254**] Medical Center on [**2200-8-18**] with malaise, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was found to be in acute liver and kidney failure in the setting of likely acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity and was transferred for further management. 

Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 7850**] has several medical conditions including acute hepatitis, acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection (UTI), abdominal pain, alcoholism/polysubstance abuse, and hepatitis C. The assessment and plan include managing acute hepatitis, acute kidney injury, UTI, abdominal pain, alcoholism/polysubstance abuse, and hepatitis C. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute hepatitis: There is a heavy APAP use, NSAIDs, underlying hepatitis C, and alcohol abuse. Trend LFTs (liver function tests) should be done to monitor the progression of liver damage. Clarify interpretation of high serum iron and tibc (?hemochromatosis) should also be considered. No steroids per liver fellow is mentioned, indicating that steroid treatment may not be recommended at this time. 

2. Acute kidney injury: It is likely hep"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 7850**], a 43-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, intravenous drug use (IVDU), and hepatitis C, presented to Southern [**Hospital 254**] Medical Center on [**2200-8-18**] with malaise, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was found to be in acute liver and kidney failure in the setting of likely acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity and was transferred for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute hepatitis: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 7850**] has multiple risk factors for acute hepatitis, including heavy APAP use, NSAID use, underlying hepatitis C, and alcohol abuse. It is important to monitor liver function tests (LFTs) regularly and consider additional diagnostic tests such as an abdominal ultrasound to rule out other causes of liver inflammation.
2. Anemia: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 7850**]'s hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has decreased from 35% to 27%, which is concerning for bleeding. Guaiac testing should be performed to check for occult blood in the stool, and a complete blood count (CBC) with reticulocyte count should be done to assess for bone marrow response. Further evaluation may include a peripheral blood smear and iron studies.
