   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/oF with multiple medical comorbidities and recent prolonged
   hospitalization for pneumonia/trach found to have CBD stones base on CT
   from [**2104-4-23**] now undergoing ERCP with removal of stones and
   sphincterotomy. There is no record of fever in the accompanying notes,
   and the white count in the OSH records seems to be mildly elevated but
   stable. She does not clinically meet the criteria for cholangitis at
   this time.
   # CBD Stones
   - s/p ERCP now, will hold aspirin for now per advanced endoscopy team
   for now
   - will continue antibiotics for now per-procedurally, and discuss with
   team for duration. Likely 24-48h and trend WBC since this has been
   managed interventionally. Cipro 400mg IV q12h and metronidazole 500mg
   IV q8h.
   - trend tbili, lfts
   # Respiratory Failure/COPD
   - Patient underwent procedure under anesthesia and was intubated for
   this procedure.
   - on AC for now, will change to CPAP/PS and aim for extubation tomorrow
   after SBT
   # Diabetes
   - Noted to be type one, had
 dose glargine last night, and received
   glucagon during ERCP which could elevate BS. For now will continue the
   glargine 13 units sc at bedtime, and cover with humalog sliding scale.
   If difficult to control sugars, we can change over to nph and humalog
   coverage to allow for tighter titration.
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF
   - compensated and stable at this time. Will hold dose of lisinopril
   overnight given her lower bps requiring fluid boluses of 1 liter total,
   and restart tomorrow.
   # h/o possible but not confirmed c. diff, not recently on treatment.
   Will send c.diff if suspicion is raised by diarrhea.
   # Asthma: can try MDI if necessary
   # h/o HTN: hold HCTZ/lisinopril overnight.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities who was recently hospitalized for pneumonia and tracheostomy. She is currently undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to common bile duct (CBD) stones. The patient does not meet the criteria for cholangitis at this time.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/60 mmHg to 95/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated blood glucose level. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, total bilirubin, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient is receiving antibiotics prophylactically for the ERCP procedure, specifically ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Her diabetes management plan includes glargine insulin at bedtime and humalog sliding scale coverage. Lisinopril is held overnight due to low blood pressure, and she will be restarted tomorrow.

The patient's chronic diastolic congestive heart failure is stable at this"

","The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetes mellitus, type I. The patient was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 132/60 mmHg to 95/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient has been receiving propofol infusion and other ICU medications. The fluid balance shows an intake of 1,570 mL with output of 582 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 988 mL. The patient's blood products show a total out of 800 mL, urine output of 282 mL, and NG output not recorded.

Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode. The set tidal volume is 550 mL, respiratory rate is set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP is 5 cmH2O, FiO2 is 40%, and the RSBI is 85. The plateau pressure is 24 cmH2O, compliance is 28.9 cmH2O/mL, and SpO2 is 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 397 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 173 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

The patient's imaging shows slight improvement in left lower lobe consolidation, and the endotracheal tube is positioned 2 cm from the carina. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, type I, impaired skin integrity, and hypovolemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility and invasive ventilation. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent these complications."

   Agree with plan to hold on extubation for now--Will send sputum cx

   may not allow for cuff leak but given reportedly difficult intubation
   and recent ICU course with prior trach--will give 24 hrs of steroids
   and reassess for cuff leak tomorrow.  Currently being

Would change to PSV and if unable to tolerate would
   adjust MV to optimize abg by reducing TV on vent.  Pending reassessment
   in am, may attempt to extubate with anesthesia present or over cook

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia and tracheostomy. She underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to cholangitis caused by common bile duct (CBD) stones. The procedure required general anesthesia and intubation. The patient has been experiencing thick and white secretions requiring frequent suctioning since then. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Diabetes Mellitus Type I: The patient has uncontrolled diabetes, as indicated by her high blood glucose level of 195 mg/dL.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged immobility and decubitus positioning.
3. Hypovolemia (Volume Depletion without Shock): The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 988 mL and output of 582 mL, indicating a negative fluid balance.
4. Difficult Airway: The patient had a difficult intubation, and there is no cuff leak, which makes extubation challenging.
5. Thick Respiratory Secretions: The patient requires frequent suctioning of thick and white secretions, impacting her ability to be extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP."

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - Given the patient's history of type I diabetes, there is a risk of DKA if her blood sugar levels are not well controlled.
2. Pressure Ulcers - Prolonged immobility and pressure from the endotracheal tube can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
3. Infection - The patient is at an increased risk of developing infections due to her compromised immune system from diabetes and prolonged intubation.
4. Fluid Imbalance - The patient has signs of hypovolemia, indicating a potential fluid imbalance that needs to be addressed.
5. Respiratory Complications - The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any complications related to mechanical ventilation and weaning off the ventilator."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and recent hospitalization with pneumonia. She underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to cholangitis and removal of common bile duct (CBD) stones. The patient was intubated for the procedure and has been in the ICU since then. She is currently on supplemental oxygen and has been experiencing thick secretions requiring suctioning every hour. Her vital signs are stable, but she has impaired skin integrity, hypovolemia, and impaired respiratory function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and requires mechanical ventilation support. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or complications related to prolonged intubation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheal stenosis.

2. Diabetic Complications: The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections, delayed wound healing, and other diabetic complications.

3. Infection: Given the patient's recent hospitalization and invasive procedures, there is a risk of developing healthcare-associated infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or wound infections.

5. Hypovolemia: The patient is experiencing hypovolem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities, including COPD, asthma, diabetes, chronic diastolic CHF, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and underwent an ERCP procedure with removal of CBD stones and sphincterotomy. The patient remains stable and afebrile overnight. She has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in her respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient has a history of difficult airway and copious secretion production, which may pose a barrier to extubation. There is concern for laryngeal edema or pulmonary process contributing to her respiratory failure. Overventilation of a COPD patient has been noted.

2. Hydrocortisone has been prescribed to address potential adrenal insufficiency during steroid tapering. The patient's cuff leak should be reassessed tomorrow for extubation, with anesthesia present.

3. The pressure support will be changed to allow for patient-controlled ventilation, with the expectation of drifting PCO2 levels to 50-60 to normalize pH.

4. Obtaining OSH records regarding recent pneumonia will help interpret chest X-ray findings and current clinical presentation. Sputum cultures and repeat CXR have also been ordered.

5. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, and aspirin has been withheld per advanced endoscopy team. Antibiotics (C"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/oF with multiple medical comorbidities and recent prolonged
   hospitalization for pneumonia/trach s/p ERCP with removal of CBD stones
   and sphincterotomy.  She remains afebrile and stable overnight.
   # Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient has done well on A/C
   overnight and tolerated a Pressure support trial.  She has a history
   difficult airway and currently has no cuff leak and copious secretion
   production. Concern for laryngeal edema versus pulmonary process as
   barriers to extubation.  Recent gas demonstrates likely overventilation
   of a COPD patient.
   - Hydrocort 50mg TID x1 day, reassess cuff leak tomorrow for extubation
   with anesthesia present
   - Change to Pressure Support to allow for patient controlled
   ventillation, PCO2 will likely drift to 50-60 to normalize her pH.
   - Obtain OSH records re recent PNA to help interpret CXR and current
   findings, as well as recent micro and abx
   - Nebs PRN
   - Repeat CXR
   - Sputum cultures
   - Defer Bronch today
   # CBD Stones
   - s/p ERCP now, will hold aspirin for now per advanced endoscopy team
   for now
   - will continue antibiotics for now peri-procedurally, and discuss with
   team for duration. Likely 24-48h and trend WBC since this has been
   managed interventionally. Cipro 400mg IV q12h and metronidazole 500mg
   IV q8h.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities and recent prolonged hospitalization for pneumonia/trach s/p ERCP with removal of CBD stones and sphincterotomy. The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure/COPD/asthma. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/60 mmHg to 77/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 1,570 mL of IV fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 582 mL of blood products, 282 mL of urine, and negative balances in other areas. 

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 228, and ventilation rate of 5.1 L/min. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished but overweight/obese, with normal head, ears, nose, and throat examination. The cardiovascular examination shows no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds, and the peripheral vascular examination reveals diminished pulses in both lower extremities. The respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds. 

The abdominal examination reveals a soft and non-tender abdomen without bowel sounds or distension. The extremities show trace edema without cyanosis, and the neurologic examination shows sedation without paralysis or abnormal tone. 

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 397 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of 173 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal range. Imaging reveals slight improvement in left lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray, with the endotracheal tube positioned approximately 2 cm from the carina. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure/COPD/asthma management, treatment for recent prolonged hospitalization and pneumonia, management of CBD stones, and care for chronic diastolic CHF and diabetes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, volutrauma, oxygen toxicity, and infections due to the use of indwelling lines or devices. Additionally, there is a concern for laryngeal edema as a barrier to extubation."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/oF with multiple medical comorbidities and recent prolonged
   hospitalization for pneumonia/trach s/p ERCP with removal of CBD stones
   and sphincterotomy.
   # Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient remains intubated after
   ERCP.  Given her lack of cuff leak yesterday, she was given a short
   course of glucocorticoids and today does have a cuff leak.  Of note,
   her sputum is positive for GPCs in clusters and pairs.  This could be
   HCAP, HAP or VAP or tracheobronchitis given her recent hospital courses
   and relatively short stay on a ventilator. She is tolerating PSV on
   [**9-22**] well
   - Extubation today pending Hct stability (see below)
   - Vancomycin 1g Q12 with trough after dose three pending speciation of
   her sputum flora
   - NPO for extubation
   # Blood volume instability: The patient had physiology and laboratory
   studies consistent with blood loss yesterday night, but as of yet has
   not demonstrated a bleeding source.  She was transfused 1 unit of blood
   and returned to within her pre-
bleed
 hematocrit.
   - Hematocrit at 11am and 7pm (TID), transfusing as necessary
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stools
   - monitor lines for bleeding
   # CBD Stones: S/P ERCP day 2, will continue antibiotics and continue
   PEG tube feeds once she is extubated
   - Appreciated ERCP recs
   # Diabetes: Type 1.  Continue Home Lantus 28 units SC QHS and sliding
   scale given short steroid pulse.
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Holding lisinopril now, will readdress given
   blood pressure throughout the day.
   # h/o HTN: hold HCTZ/lisinopril overnight.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities who has been admitted to the ICU. She has a history of pneumonia, tracheostomy following ERCP with removal of CBD stones and sphincterotomy, COPD/asthma, blood volume instability, diabetes type 1, and chronic diastolic CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient remains intubated after ERCP due to lack of cuff leak. She was given a short course of glucocorticoids and now has a cuff leak. Her sputum is positive for Gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs, which could indicate Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or tracheobronchitis given her recent hospital courses and relatively short stay on a ventilator.

2. Blood Volume Instability: The patient had physiology and laboratory studies consistent with blood loss yesterday night, but no bleeding source has been identified yet. She was transfused 1 unit of blood and returned to within her pre-bleed hematocrit.

3. Diabetes: The patient has type 1 diabetes and is currently on Home Lantus 28 units SC QHS and sliding scale insulin. The short steroid pulse may affect her glucose control, so she will continue with sliding scale insulin.

4. Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, including respiratory failure, COPD/asthma, CBD stones, type 1 diabetes, chronic diastolic CHF, and hypertension. He is currently admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and tracheostomy following an ERCP procedure to remove CBD stones and sphincterotomy. The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His recent events include sputum culture, insertion of a PICC line, initiation of steroids, increase in Lantus dosage, and transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells due to a hypotensive tachycardic episode. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate between 59-118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/52 to 137/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus bradycardia. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2382 mL and output of 2060 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 322 mL. His respiratory support includes a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O, and a compliance of 45.5 mL/cmH2O.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/oF with multiple medical comorbidities and recent prolonged
   hospitalization for pneumonia/trach s/p ERCP with removal of CBD stones
   and sphincterotomy.
   # Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient remains intubated after
   ERCP.  Given her lack of cuff leak yesterday, she was given a short
   course of glucocorticoids and today does have a cuff leak.  Of note,
   her sputum is positive for GPCs in clusters and pairs.  This could be
   HCAP, HAP or VAP or tracheobronchitis given her recent hospital courses
   and relatively short stay on a ventilator. She is tolerating PSV on
   [**9-22**] well
   - Extubation today pending Hct stability (see below)
   - Vancomycin 1g Q12 with trough after dose three pending speciation of
   her sputum flora
   - NPO for extubation
   # Blood volume instability: The patient had physiology and laboratory
   studies consistent with blood loss yesterday night, but as of yet has
   not demonstrated a bleeding source.  She was transfused 1 unit of blood
   and returned to within her pre-
bleed
 hematocrit.
   - Hematocrit at 11am and 7pm (TID), transfusing as necessary
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stools
   - monitor lines for bleeding
   # CBD Stones: S/P ERCP day 2, will continue antibiotics and continue
   PEG tube feeds once she is extubated
   - Appreciated ERCP recs
   # Diabetes: Type 1.  Continue Home Lantus 28 units SC QHS and sliding
   scale given short steroid pulse.
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Holding lisinopril now, will readdress given
   blood pressure throughout the day.
   # h/o HTN: hold HCTZ/lisinopril overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities, who was admitted for pneumonia and underwent an ERCP procedure.
- She remains intubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with an FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
- Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/41 mmHg to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient has been receiving various medications including propofol, antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole), dextrose, and others.
- Her blood cultures are positive for MRSA and Staph Aureus in the sputum.
- She has a history of respiratory failure, COPD, asthma, recent hospitalization, and has been on mechanical ventilation for a short duration.
- The plan is to extubate the patient today pending hematocrit stability and continue antibiotics while monitoring for any signs of bleeding.
- Other plans include continuing PEG tube feeds post-extubation and managing her diabetes, chronic diastolic CHF, and hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/oF with multiple medical comorbidities and recent prolonged
   hospitalization for pneumonia/trach s/p ERCP with removal of CBD stones
   and sphincterotomy.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient remains intubated after
   ERCP though she did not have lung pathology (besides underlying lung
   disease) prior to intubation.  She now has MRSA growing in her sputum
   and likely had too much volume overnight for her hypernatremia.  Her
   RISB is high and her current respiratory status during a spontaneous
   breathing trial suggests that she will not be an easy extubation.
   Will aim for extubation tonight vs. tomorrow AM
   -ABG on [**4-22**] after 3-4 hours
   -Bronch today to make sure her airway is clear before extubation
   - Continue Vancomycin but change dose from 1g Q12 to 1g q24 given high
   trough
   - Resume TF for now,  NPO for extubation tomorrow
   - Stop d5@150.
   .
   # Blood volume instability: The patient bumped appropriately and has no
   identifiable bleeding source.
   - Hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stools
   - monitor lines for bleeding
   - transfuse for HCT <24
   #Hypernatremia: Resolved with intiation of free water and tube feeds.
   -stop d5
   -continue free water with tube feeds
   -PM sodium
   .
   # CBD Stones: S/P ERCP day 3, will continue antibiotics and continue
   PEG tube feeds once she is extubated
   -Continue Cipro/Flagyl
   - Appreciated ERCP recs
   # Diabetes: Type 1.  Continue Home Lantus at 26 units SC QHS and
   sliding scale given short steroid pulse.
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Holding lisinopril now, patient remains
   normotensive.
   # h/o HTN: hold HCTZ/lisinopril.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 5938**] is slightly more awake on decreasing levels of sedation but
   not completely oriented as yet. Secretions may have increased from ETT
   without fever or increasing O2 need.
   Exam notable for elderly BF who reponds only to pain Tm99 BP 155/70 HR
   of 88 RR of 24 with sats of 98% on 40% FiO2 . She has decreased BS at
   bases but no wheezing. minimal edema noted too.
    Labs notable for WBC 7.8 K, HCT 28 , K+3.7 , Cr 0.6 . CXR with
   bibasilar ASD vs atelectasis
   Agree with plan to lighten sedation and continue prolonged PSV/ CPAP
   trial . She will benefit from bronchosocpy to aid with secretion
   clearance. Suspect if there are no hemodynamic setbacks in next 24 hrs,
   we will plan for extubation in am [**5-4**]
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities and recent prolonged hospitalization for pneumonia, tracheostomy, and ERCP with removal of CBD stones. She remains intubated after ERCP, though she did not have lung pathology prior to intubation. She has MRSA growing in her sputum and likely had too much volume overnight for her hypernatremia. Her RISB is high, and her current respiratory status during a spontaneous breathing trial suggests that she will not be an easy extubation. The plan is to aim for extubation tonight or tomorrow morning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure and underlying lung disease. The presence of MRSA in her sputum indicates a potential source of infection, which can complicate the respiratory status.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia that was resolved with the initiation of free water and tube feeds. However, there is a risk of re-accumulation of sodium imbalance if fluid management is not carefully monitored.

3. Blood volume instability: The patient has experienced bumps appropriately without an identifiable bleeding source. Close monitoring of blood parameters and active tissue and specimen sampling are necessary to prevent any further complications related to blood volume instability.

4. CBD Stones: The patient had CBD stones that were removed via ERCP. Antibiotics and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities who has been hospitalized for pneumonia and underwent ERCP with removal of CBD stones and sphincterotomy. She remains intubated after ERCP and has been diagnosed with MRSA in her sputum. The patient also has hypernatremia, which has been resolved with free water and tube feeds. She has a history of type 1 diabetes, chronic diastolic CHF, and hypertension. The patient's respiratory status suggests that she may not be an easy candidate for extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated, and her respiratory status during a spontaneous breathing trial suggests difficulty with extubation. There is a risk of ongoing respiratory failure if extubation is not successful.
2. MRSA Infection: The presence of MRSA in her sputum indicates a potential ongoing infection that needs to be addressed and monitored closely.
3. Hypernatremia: Although the patient's hypernatremia has been resolved, there is a risk of its recurrence if fluid balance is not maintained properly.
4. Blood Volume Instability: The patient has experienced blood volume instability, and ongoing monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of bleeding or the need for transfusion.
5. Diabetes Management: The patient's type 1 diabetes requires careful monitoring and management of blood glucose levels, especially during the stress of illness and hospital"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities who was admitted for pneumonia and underwent an ERCP procedure. She remains intubated and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, positive sputum for Staph Aureus, hypernatremia, and blood volume instability. She has also had a history of diabetes, chronic diastolic CHF, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status suggests that she may not be an easy candidate for extubation. Close monitoring and repeated spontaneous breathing trials will be necessary to assess her readiness for extubation.
2. Infection: The patient's sputum is positive for Staph Aureus, indicating a possible hospital-acquired infection. Antibiotics should be continued, and precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of infection.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient had resolved hypernatremia with repletion of free water and tube feeds. It is important to maintain fluid balance and monitor electrolyte levels.
4. Blood Volume Instability: The patient has had a bump without any identifiable bleeding source. Monitoring for bleeding and appropriate transfusion when necessary will be crucial.
5. Diabetes: The patient has type 1 diabetes and requires ongoing management of blood glucose levels, especially during the steroid treatment.
6. Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient's CHF should be closely monitored, and medications"

 HYPOVOLEMIA (VOLUME DEPLETION - WITHOUT SHOCK)
   76 y/oF with multiple medical comorbidities and recent prolonged
   hospitalization for pneumonia/trach s/p ERCP with removal of CBD stones
   and sphincterotomy.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient remains intubated after
   ERCP though she did not have lung pathology (besides underlying lung
   disease) prior to intubation.  She now has MRSA growing in her sputum
   and likely had too much volume overnight for her hypernatremia.  Her
   RISB is high and her current respiratory status during a spontaneous
   breathing trial suggests that she will not be an easy extubation.
   Will aim for extubation tonight vs. tomorrow AM
   -ABG on [**4-22**] after 3-4 hours
   -Bronch today to make sure her airway is clear before extubation
   - Continue Vancomycin but change dose from 1g Q12 to 1g q24 given high
   trough
   - Resume TF for now,  NPO for extubation tomorrow
   - Stop d5@150.
   .
   # Blood volume instability: Hct stable yesterday without further
   transfusions.  No identifiable source of bleeding.
   - Hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stools
   - monitor lines for bleeding
   - transfuse for HCT <24
   #Hypernatremia: Resolved with intiation of free water and tube feeds.
   Currently mildly hyponatremic.
   -stop d5
   -continue free water with tube feeds
   -PM sodium
   .
   # CBD Stones: S/P ERCP day 3, will continue antibiotics and continue
   PEG tube feeds once she is extubated
   -Continue Cipro/Flagyl
   - Appreciated ERCP recs
   # Diabetes: Type 1.  Continue Home Lantus at 26 units SC QHS and
   sliding scale given short steroid pulse.
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Holding lisinopril now, patient remains
   normotensive.
   # h/o HTN: hold HCTZ/lisinopril.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities. She has been hospitalized for pneumonia and underwent an ERCP procedure, which resulted in the removal of CBD stones and sphincterotomy. The patient remains intubated, and there are concerns about respiratory failure due to underlying lung disease. MRSA has been identified in her sputum, and bronchoscopy did not reveal any clear barrier to extubation. The patient appears ready for extubation but will require close monitoring of her respiratory status.

The patient also has blood volume instability with a stable hematocrit level without further transfusions. No identifiable source of bleeding has been found. It is important to continue monitoring her for any signs of bleeding and to consider transfusion if her hematocrit drops below 24.

Hypernatremia has resolved with the initiation of free water and tube feeds. The patient is currently mildly hyponatremic, so no further d5 is needed.

The patient underwent an ERCP procedure for CBD stones and is now on day 4 post-procedure. She is being treated with antibiotics for this.

The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes. She should continue with her home Lantus insulin at 26 units subcutaneously every night and use a sliding scale for additional insulin as needed.

The patient has chronic diastolic congestive heart failure and is currently normotensive. Lisinopril has been"

   76 y/oF with multiple medical comorbidities and recent prolonged
   hospitalization for pneumonia/trach s/p ERCP with removal of CBD stones
   and sphincterotomy.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient remains intubated after
   ERCP though she did not have lung pathology (besides underlying lung
   disease) prior to intubation.  She now has MRSA growing in her sputum
   and likely contribution from volume.  Broncoscopy yesterday did not
   show any clear barrier to extubation.   Good cough and + cuff leak.
   Currently on [**9-22**] with 40% FiO2 and appears ready for extubation.
   - Extubate
   - Monitor respiratory status
   - Continue Vancomycin (day 1=[**5-1**], dose decreased [**5-3**], will need
   trough [**5-5**])
   - Change MDI to nebulizers, as she is unable to cooperate with MDI
   .
   # Blood volume instability: Hct stable yesterday without further
   transfusions.  No identifiable source of bleeding.
   - Hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stools
   - monitor lines for bleeding
   - transfuse for HCT <24
   #Hypernatremia: Resolved with intiation of free water and tube feeds.
   Currently mildly hyponatremic.
   - no further d5
   .
   # CBD Stones: She did not have cholangitis, rather stones + pain.  Now
   s/p ERCP day 4.
   - Continue Cipro/Flagyl (day 1=[**4-28**])
   - clarify antibiotic course with ERCP
   # Diabetes: Type 1.
   - Continue Home Lantus at 26 units SC QHS and sliding scale
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Holding lisinopril now, patient remains
   normotensive.
   # h/o HTN: she has been normotensive

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 5938**] is more awake on decreasing levels of sedation and oriented
   to simple commands. Bronchoscopy did reveal moderate secretions in
   lower lobes but without purulence.
   Exam notable for elderly BF who responds only to pain Tm 99.6 BP
   134/70 HR of 88 RR of 24 with sats of 98% on 40% FiO2 . She has
   decreased BS at bases but no wheezing. There is minimal edema noted
   too. Her RSBI is 60
    Labs notable for WBC 7.8 K, HCT 32, K+ 4.2 , Cr 0.6 . CXR with
   bibasilar ASD ( R> L)
   Agree with plan to extubate today. She appears ready for this. She will
   need help with secretion clearance after extubation but hopefully with
   improved mentation and good cough she will be able to handle this.
   Antibioitics to be continued per culture review.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type I, impaired skin integrity, hypovolemia, chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, and a history of hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and underwent an ERCP procedure. The patient remains intubated and has been diagnosed with MRSA in her sputum. She is currently receiving tube feeds and has had bronchoscopy performed, which showed mucoid secretions in the lower lobes but no clear barrier to extubation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient's underlying lung disease may contribute to respiratory failure, and the presence of MRSA in her sputum increases the risk of infection and worsening respiratory status.

2. Blood volume instability: The patient's hematocrit levels have been stable without further transfusions, but there is no identifiable source of bleeding. Monitoring for bleeding and adjusting transfusion requirements accordingly is essential.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient previously had hypernatremia but has resolved with the initiation of free water and tube feeds. Continued monitoring of electrolyte levels is necessary.

4. CBD Stones: Although the patient did not have cholangitis, she underwent an ERCP procedure for CBD stones. Monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who underwent an ERCP procedure and is currently in the ICU. She was extubated in the morning and is doing well from a respiratory standpoint. The patient restarted her home antihypertensive medications (HCTZ 12.5mg and lisinopril 20mg). There is a need to clarify the course of antibiotics (cipro/flagyl) with the ERCP team. The patient also restarted tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/COPD/Asthma: The patient had respiratory failure and was intubated. Although she was successfully extubated, she still has MRSA pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory symptoms or developing further respiratory complications.
2. CBD Stones: The patient had common bile duct stones and underwent an ERCP procedure. There is a possibility of post-ERCP complications such as pancreatitis or cholangitis.
3. Diabetes: The patient has type 1 diabetes and requires ongoing management of her blood glucose levels.
4. Chronic Diastolic CHF/HTN: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic congestive heart failure and hypertension. Restarting her antihypertensive medications is important to control her blood pressure.

Please note that the above summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type I, impaired skin integrity, and hypovolemia. He was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and received ciprofloxacin and metronidazole antibiotics.

The patient was extubated in the morning and is doing well from a respiratory standpoint. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 138/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. He is receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and regular insulin for glycemic control.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 27,000 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 227 mg/dL, and slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits. The patient's imaging shows an improved right lower lobe consolidation.

The patient's microbiology results indicate the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on the gram stain"
