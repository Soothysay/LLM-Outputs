","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for an elective coronary and renal angiogram but developed pneumonia and was transferred to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction and multiple stents placed in the left circumflex artery. She recently experienced chest pain with anterior ST changes suggestive of a culprit lesion in the left anterior descending artery. She is scheduled for a repeat catheterization in the morning to address this issue.

The patient also has a history of severe renal artery stenosis, which was treated with stenting. Her renal function has been improving gradually, but it may have been affected by IV contrast during the cardiac and renal angiogram.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, Plavix, nitroglycerin, heparin, statins, carvedilol, and tranexamic acid. She is also being transfused with packed red blood cells to improve coronary and renal perfusion.

Additional findings include new onset heart failure, likely secondary to the myocardial infarction, as evidenced by the presence of an S3 heart sound and crackles on lung examination. The patient does not have a baseline B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level.

The patient's recent labs show elevated levels of tropon"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but developed pneumonia and experienced a myocardial infarction (CAD/NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and is now in the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, renal artery stenosis, hypertension, GERD, thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter, urinary dysfunction, degenerative joint disease, and cholesterol emboli to the left eye. She is currently receiving various medications for these conditions.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 106/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and temperature within normal range. Fluid balance shows an intake of 206 mL and output of 1,800 mL, indicating significant fluid loss. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, or other physical examination findings. Laboratory results show elevated platelet count and troponin-T levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has left midlobe pneumonia. She is already receiving vancomycin and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but was complicated by pneumonia and underwent cardiac catheterization. The patient has been admitted to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of infection, and potential sepsis.
2. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient's presentation and subsequent cardiac catheterization suggest that she may have had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), specifically a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Complications associated with MI include heart failure, arrhythmias, and further ischemic events.
3. Renal Artery Stenosis: The patient has a history of renal artery stenosis, which has been treated with stenting. Complications related to this condition may include worsening renal function and potential kidney injury.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history includes atrial fibrillation, for which she has undergone cardioversion. Complications associated with atrial fibrillation may include stroke or thromboembolism.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which if poorly controlled, can lead to complications such as"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but was complicated by pneumonia and transferred to the CCU.

The patient had overlapping bare metal stents (BMS) placed to the left circumflex artery and could not open a chronic total occlusion of the OM1. Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes suggestive of LAD as the site of culprit lesion for chest pain. Upon return to the cath lab again, a BMS was placed to the mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had collaterals to the inferior wall. The patient returned to the floor without chest pain.

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal artery stenosis. Her creatinine worsened after cardiac and renal angiogram, possibly due to IV contrast, embolized plaque from stenting, newly started antibiotics, or hypoperfusion of kidneys from hypotension. The patient is now anuric, and fluids are being withheld due to the use of non-rebreather mask (NRB).

The patient also has hypoxia, most likely secondary to pneumonia, but superimposed CHF is also possible. Diuresis has been ineffective, and antibiotics have been completed. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP"

   In comparison to the chest radiograph one day earlier, the
   consolidation
   throughout the left upper lobe and probably lingula has slightly
   improved and
   is now less dense. Bilateral small pleural effusions are stable. No
   newly
   developed areas of consolidation, or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is
   stable. There is prominence of the vascular markings in the upper lobes
   without overt evidence of of pulmonary edema.
   IMPRESSION:
   Improved left upper lobe and lingular consolidation is most likely
   pneumonia,
   although aspiration is another consideration.
   Microbiology: No new micro data

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, PVD, and chronic kidney disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but experienced complications including pneumonia, myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute renal failure. She underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting of the left circumflex artery. The patient has been in the ICU since then and has shown improvement in her condition. However, she remains anuric (no urine output) and is on dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient had hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is improving but may still require further treatment.
2. Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient had an NSTEMI during the cardiac catheterization, but it was managed with stenting of the left circumflex artery.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient developed ARF, which is likely due to the combination of contrast nephropathy, embolized plaque from stenting, newly started antibiotics, and hypoperfusion of the kidneys. She is currently anuric and requires dialysis.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient had pulmonary edema, which is improving but may still require further treatment.
5. Hypoxia: The patient had hypoxia likely due to resolving pneumonia. It is being managed"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but experienced complications including pneumonia and renal artery stenting. She was transferred to the CCU after cardiac catheterization.

The patient underwent PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with two overlapping Vision BMSs, but an unsuccessful attempt was made to revascularize the OM2 chronic total occlusion. She also had staged PCI of the mid LAD.

The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and renal artery stenosis. Her renal function has worsened, leading to acute renal failure (ARF).

Assessment and plan:
1. CAD/NSTEMI: The patient had chest pain and anterior ST changes suggestive of LAD as the site of culprit lesion for chest pain. She underwent BMS placement to the mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had collaterals to the inferior wall. She returned to the floor without chest pain.

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, PVD, and previous mechanical AVR. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but experienced complications, including pneumonia and a myocardial infarction. She was transferred to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema, which may be related to heart failure or fluid overload.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have worsened, and she is now anuric. This could be due to contrast-induced nephropathy, embolized plaque from stenting, newly started antibiotics, or hypoperfusion of the kidneys.
4. Hypoxia: The patient may have hypoxia due to pneumonia or superimposed congestive heart failure. Diuresis has been ineffective, and antibiotics have been completed.

She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but experienced complications, including pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and placement of a stent in the left circumflex artery. She is currently in the ICU with worsening renal function and oliguria. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, which may be related to her recent cardiac event and heart failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of pneumonia, which may be hospital-acquired (non-ventilator-associated pneumonia).
3. Acute Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient had an NSTEMI during the cardiac catheterization, for which she received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has worsened, leading to anuria. She requires close monitoring and management of renal function, including the use of diuretics and renal dosing of medications.
5. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, likely due to her pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Nebulizer treatments and mucolytics are being"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, an 80-year-old woman, was admitted for elective coronary and renal angiogram. The procedure was complicated by pneumonia and the patient was transferred to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has worsened. The patient has been experiencing low urine output (anuria), elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and worsening renal function. A renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis or decreased blood flow to the kidneys.

The patient also has moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, with the left side being loculated. Imaging showed multifocal opacity and ground-glass consolidation in the lungs, which may be indicative of retained contrast from the angiogram.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), a heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/54 mmHg to 161/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, troponin-T levels, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU for renal artery stenting and coronary angiography. The patient's course has been complicated by several medical conditions and complications.

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has developed pulmonary edema, which is a condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to difficulty in breathing and decreased oxygenation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has also been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically a hospital-acquired pneumonia that is not ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing.

3. Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack): The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction, which refers to a heart attack. This is indicated by elevated cardiac biomarkers (troponin-T) and the presence of chest opacities and ground-glass consolidation on the CT chest.

4. Renal Function Impairment: The patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels from 1.8 to 3.6. This can be attributed to the recent contrast exposure during the cardiac catheterization and potential acute kidney injury.

5. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions, which are collections of fluid around the lungs. The right-sided effusion is dependent, while the left-sided effusion is loc"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis
   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and is transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, atorvastatin 40
   - restarted heparin 6 hrs after sheath pulled (without bolus)
   - nitro gtt weaned off
   - continue metoprolol 25mg PO TID
   - no integrelin given ARF
   .
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, embolized plaque from stenting, newly started antibiotics,
   hypoperfusion of kidneys from hypotension. Creatinine continues to
   worsen, and now anuric. Renal u/s with Doppler flow negative.
   - Renal consult
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - If lytes become abnormal, will consider dialysis
   - 250cc boluses titrate to urine output but cautiously monitor
   respiratory status
   - renally dose meds

   # Hypoxia: Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural effusions, L
   sided loculated. Etiology of effusions may be parapneumonic or empyema
   given white count and fevers and recent PNA. Heart failure possible
   contributor but unlikely the sole contributor given bilaterality and
   loculations. Abx course complete. PE less likely as we have a good
   reason for the hypoxia.
   - Recommend diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis to rule out
   empyema
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - Would recommend therefore dc

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but was complicated by pneumonia and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). She underwent coronary angiography with stenting of the left circumflex artery and renal artery stenting. The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema, pneumonia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has moderate-sized pleural effusions, which may be due to parapneumonic or empyema. Heart failure is a possible contributor but not the sole cause given the bilaterality and loculations. Diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis is recommended.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of pneumonia, which may be hospital-acquired. Antibiotic treatment should be continued, and further evaluation of the lung infection is necessary.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function has worsened, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy from the cardiac and renal angiogram, embolized plaque from stenting, newly started antibiotics, and hypoperfusion of the kidneys. Renal dosing of medications is needed, and careful monitoring of respiratory status is required.

4. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels are most likely"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, PVD, and previous mechanical AVR. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but was complicated by pneumonia and transferred to the CCU. The patient underwent catheterization and placement of a stent to the left circumflex artery. She has a history of renal artery stenosis, which has been treated with stenting. Her current condition includes acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are worsening, indicating possible acute renal failure, which could be due to IV contrast from cardiac and renal angiogram.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has bilateral moderate pleural effusions, which may be parapneumonic or empyema given the white count and fevers. Heart failure is a possible contributor but unlikely the sole cause.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of multifocal pneumonia, and the imaging shows patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacities.
4. Myocardial infarction: The patient experienced chest pain and anterior ST changes suggestive of LAD as the site of culprit lesion for chest pain.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which was managed with cardioversion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was admitted to the ICU for right renal artery stenting and coronary angiography. The procedure was complicated by a transfer to the CCU following catheterization and placement of a stent to the left circumflex. The patient experienced multiple complications including acute renal failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The patient's renal function has been declining, as indicated by increasing levels of creatinine. The patient also has a history of renal artery stenosis. Imaging shows bilateral moderate pleural effusions, multifocal patchy consolidation, and ground-glass opacities in the lungs, which are most likely due to multifocal pneumonia. There is also mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely hyperplastic in the setting of pneumonia. The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating, and there have been changes in platelet count and hemoglobin levels. The patient is currently on multiple medications including furosemide, lasix, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they remain on respiratory support with an oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's code status is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of multifocal pneumonia, and imaging shows patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacities in the lungs. This indicates an ongoing infection, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially progress to sepsis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but developed pneumonia and was transferred to the CCU after catheterization and placement of a stent to the left circumflex artery.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Renal failure: The patient has worsening renal function indicated by increasing creatinine levels. She has a history of renal artery stenosis, which was treated with stenting. The recent cardiac and renal angiogram may have contributed to acute renal failure due to IV contrast. The patient is currently on lasix gtt and metolazone 5mg PO BID to augment diuresis. Temporary dialysis line is being considered.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has bilateral moderate pleural effusions, likely secondary to congestive heart failure. Parapneumonic/emypema is also in the differential diagnosis. However, the patient's white count is trending down, and she has been afebrile, making empyema less likely. The patient is being closely monitored, and a diagnostic thoracentesis may be performed if she spikes another fever or shows signs of decompensation.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis
   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and is transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Creatinine
   peaked at 5.6, and now making excellent urine off of lasix gtt!
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - continue lasix gtt
   - DC metolazone
   - No further need for temporary dialysis line
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural effusions, L
   sided loculated. Etiology of effusions most likely CHF, however,
   parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx. Latter is unlikely given white count
   trending down and pt has been afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less
   likely as we have a good reason for the hypoxia.
   - Hold on thoracentesis given the complexity of the effusion and
   patient
s antiplatelet therapy
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - If patient spikes again or decompensates will call IR again to
   perform diagnostic thoracentesis
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Suspect patient is intravascularly dry, therefore this
   may be consistent with hypovolemic hyonatremia. This is supported by
   sodium
s improvement after discontinuing the lasix gtt.
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Encourage PO intake
   - Will discontinue lasix and metolazone
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, atorvastatin 40
   - reduce aspirin from 325 to 81 given heparin and Coumadin
   - Restart metoprolol 25mg PO TID if pressures and heart rate allow
   #. history of AS s/p mechanical AVR: in [**2199**]. Last TTE shows EF >50%,
   [**1-30**]+MR, 3+TR. Following chest pain, patient found to have new S3,
   crackles on lung exam, concerning for heart failure. Patient does not
   have baseline BNP
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - restart warfarin today, goal presumed to be 2.5-3.5

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, peripheral vascular disease, and renal artery stenosis. The patient presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but experienced complications including pneumonia, myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, and hyponatremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which could be due to IV contrast during the cardiac and renal angiogram. The presence of granular casts in the urine supports the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of bilateral moderate pleural effusions, likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF). There is also a possibility of parapneumonic or empyema, but this is less likely given the declining white blood cell count and absence of fever.

3. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient experienced chest pain with anterior ST changes suggestive of a culprit lesion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). A stent was placed in the mid-LAD calcified lesion.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, suggesting hypovolemic hyponatremia. This may be"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Making good urine output in response to diuretics and resolution of her
   ATN.  Her spirits are excellent.
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with recent renal artery stent
   placement and stent placement to the LCX (BMS) and LAD (BMS).  There
   was post procedural contrast induced nephropathy and a NSTEMI.  Her
   Creatinine has peaked at 5.6 mg/dL and she is now making urine.   She
   has a mechanical AVR and has been restarted on IV heparin to cross-over
   to warfarin.    We will continue her aspirin and clopidogrel but
   lowered her aspirin dose to aspirin 81 mg daily due to her concomitant
   warfarin therapy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease.
- She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram, which was complicated by pneumonia and acute renal failure.
- The patient underwent renal artery stenting and coronary angiography, including stent placement in the left circumflex artery and the mid-left anterior descending artery.
- She developed acute kidney injury (ATN) likely due to IV contrast, as indicated by worsening creatinine levels and the presence of granular casts in the urine.
- The patient's sodium levels were dropping, so Lasix and metolazone infusions were held. Heparin was restarted.
- She has bilateral moderate pleural effusions, likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF), but parapneumonic/emypema is also in the differential diagnosis. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and she is afebrile, making the latter less likely.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin-T) are elevated, consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
- She has hyponatremia, which is suspected to be hypovolemic due to intravascular dryness.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently in sinus rhythm.
- She has a history of degenerative joint disease, thyroid nod"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU for right renal artery stenting and coronary angiography. The patient's course has been complicated by multiple medical conditions and procedures. The patient was transferred to the CCU after experiencing complications from catheterization and placement of a stent in the left circumflex artery. The patient's sodium levels are dropping, and serum creatinine is rising, prompting the holding of Lasix and metolazone infusions. Heparin was restarted.

The patient has a history of allergies to ciprofloxacin, with unknown allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given as infusions. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium at a rate of 1,300 units/hour.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 35-36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 65 and 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/55 mmHg to 109/45 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15 and 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,267 mL total, including 79 mL of IV fluids. Output consists of 1,254 mL of urine and 500 mL of blood products. The overall fluid balance is 13 mL positive.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a face tent"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but developed pneumonia and was transferred to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring. The patient has a history of severe 95% right renal artery stenosis, which was treated with stenting. She also had a peak creatinine level of 5.6, suggesting acute renal failure, possibly due to IV contrast. The patient's urine output improved after discontinuing Lasix gtt. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. This could be due to IV contrast or underlying renal artery stenosis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient was diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, which requires appropriate antibiotic treatment.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has moderate pleural effusions on the left side, which may be causing hypoxia. This could be due to congestive heart failure or parapneumonic effusion. Thoracentesis may be considered if the patient's condition worsens.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which could be due to intravascular dehydration or hypovolemic hyponatremia. Monitoring sodium levels and encouraging oral intake is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis
   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and is transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Creatinine
   peaked at 5.6, and now making excellent urine off of lasix gtt!
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - continue lasix gtt
   - DC metolazone
   - No further need for temporary dialysis line
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural effusions, L
   sided loculated. Etiology of effusions most likely CHF, however,
   parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx. Latter is unlikely given white count
   trending down and pt has been afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less
   likely as we have a good reason for the hypoxia.
   - Hold on thoracentesis given the complexity of the effusion and
   patient
s antiplatelet therapy
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - If patient spikes again or decompensates will call IR again to
   perform diagnostic thoracentesis
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Suspect patient is intravascularly dry, therefore this
   may be consistent with hypovolemic hyonatremia. This is supported by
   sodium
s improvement after discontinuing the lasix gtt.
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Encourage PO intake
   - Will discontinue lasix and metolazone
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, atorvastatin 40
   - reduce aspirin from 325 to 81 given heparin and Coumadin
   - Restart metoprolol 25mg PO TID if pressures and heart rate allow
   #. history of AS s/p mechanical AVR: in [**2199**]. Last TTE shows EF >50%,
   [**1-30**]+MR, 3+TR. Following chest pain, patient found to have new S3,
   crackles on lung exam, concerning for heart failure. Patient does not
   have baseline BNP
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - restart warfarin today, goal presumed to be 2.5-3.5
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with h/o Afib s/p cardioversion.
   Currently in NSR.
   - holding heparin gtt for now until renal provides answer for temp HD
   line
   - continue amiodarone, metoprolol
   - restart warfarin today
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - holding metoprolol
   .
   #. GERD: Stable.
   - changed pantoprazole to ranitidine and renally dosed
   .
   #. Thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter: Continue home Levothyroxine.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have been steadily increasing, indicating a decline in kidney function. This could be due to the recent cardiac and renal angiogram, as well as the presence of severe renal artery stenosis. The patient's urine output needs to be closely monitored, and further interventions such as dialysis may be required if necessary.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient is experiencing bilateral moderate pleural effusions, which could be causing hypoxia. The etiology of the effusions is most likely congestive heart failure (CHF), but parapneumonic/emypema should also be considered. Thoracentesis may be necessary if the patient's condition worsens.

3. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient underwent coronary and renal angiogram, during which overlapping bare metal stents were placed to the left circumflex artery and could not open the chronic total occlusion of the right obtuse marginal artery. Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes suggest that the culprit lesion for chest pain is located in the left anterior descending artery. A subsequent procedure was performed to place a bare metal stent to a calcified 80% lesion in the mid left anterior descending artery. The patient has returned to the floor with chest pain free.

4. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is"

   # Hyponatremia: Pt was noted to have hyponatremia and thought was that
   she was intravascularly dry after diuresis with lasix gtt, therefore
   her lasix gtt was held.  Her sodium initially improved, but trended
   down again.  Calculated fena and feurea were both elevated c/w ATN.
   Urine osms were 299 (not concentrated) which may be because kidneys can
   not concentrate or dilute urine in setting of ATN. Pt currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - fluid restrict 1.5 L
   - continue to trend
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV

   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 .H/O RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS (RAS)
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis post mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation post cardioversion, hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram, which was complicated by pneumonia and an unknown condition. The patient is currently in the CCU post catheterization for hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which initially improved but then trended down again. Calculated free water excretion (FEUREA) was elevated, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's urine osmolarity was 299, indicating that the kidneys cannot concentrate or dilute urine in the setting of ATN. The patient appears euvolemic, suggesting no fluid overload.

Plan:
- Monitor sodium levels with [Hospital1] lytes.
- Restrict fluids to 1.5 liters.
- Continue to trend.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has severe 95% right renal artery stenosis, which was stented on [2202-4-26]. The patient's creatinine worsened after the cardiac and renal angiogram, possibly due to IV contrast. Urinalysis supports this with the"

   # Hyponatremia: Pt was noted to have hyponatremia and thought was that
   she was intravascularly dry after diuresis with lasix gtt, therefore
   her lasix gtt was held.  Her sodium initially improved, but trended
   down again.  Calculated fena and feurea were both elevated c/w ATN.
   Urine osms were 299 (not concentrated) which may be because kidneys can
   not concentrate or dilute urine in setting of ATN. Pt currently appears
   euvolemic.

   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient has been experiencing hyponatremia, which is a low sodium level in the blood. This can be due to intravascular volume depletion or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The sodium level has improved initially but then trended down again. It is important to monitor the sodium levels closely and adjust fluid intake accordingly.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and presence of granular casts in the urine suggest acute kidney injury. This could be related to the recent cardiac and renal angiogram, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient should be managed with a renal diet, restriction of fluids, and careful monitoring of electrolytes and renal function.

3. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, likely due to bilateral moderate pleural effusions. The etiology of the effusions could be congestive heart failure (CHF), but other causes such as parapneumonic or empyema should also be considered. Thoracentesis may be necessary for diagnostic purposes.

4. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient had an overlapping balloon myocardial infarction (BMS) to the left circumflex artery (LCx) and could not open the chronic total occlusion of the right omohyoid artery (OM1)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis
   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and was transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Pt was noted to have hyponatremia and thought was that
   she was intravascularly dry after diuresis with lasix gtt, therefore
   her lasix gtt was held.  Her sodium initially improved, but trended
   down again.  Calculated fena and feurea were both elevated c/w ATN.
   Urine osms were 299 (not concentrated) which may be because kidneys can
   not concentrate or dilute urine in setting of ATN. Pt currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - fluid restrict 1.5 L
   - continue to trend
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - holding lasix gtt as euvolemic
   - No further need for temporary dialysis line as making urine
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural effusions, L
   sided loculated. Etiology of effusions most likely CHF, however,
   parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx. Latter is unlikely given white count
   trending down and pt has been afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less
   likely as we have a good reason for the hypoxia.
   - Hold on thoracentesis given the complexity of the effusion and
   patient
s antiplatelet therapy
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - If patient spikes again or decompensates will call IR again to
   perform diagnostic thoracentesis
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   .
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin (81 mg given hep and Coumadin), plavix, atorvastatin
   40
   - Restart metoprolol 12.5 PO BID if pressures and heart rate allow
   #. history of AS s/p mechanical AVR: in [**2199**]. Last TTE shows EF >50%,
   [**1-30**]+MR, 3+TR.   INR today 1.8.
   - Continue heparin gtt bridge
   - restarted warfarin today, goal presumed to be 2.5-3.5
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with h/o Afib s/p cardioversion.
   Currently in NSR.
   - hep gtt and Coumadin as above
   - continue amiodarone, restart  metoprolol  as above
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - restarting metoprolol at low dose and titrate up
   .
   #. GERD: Stable.
   - changed pantoprazole to ranitidine and renally dosed
   - giving TUMS for symptoms of heartburn (do not want to give Maalox
   given renal dysfunction)
   .
   #. Thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter: Continue home Levothyroxine.

   on:[**2202-5-10**] 08:12 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, mechanical aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for an elective coronary and renal angiogram but developed pneumonia and was transferred to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient has several potential medical complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which may be due to intravascular volume depletion following diuresis with Lasix. Her sodium levels improved initially but then worsened again. Both calculated free water excretion and fractional excretion of sodium are elevated, consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient appears euvolemic, and her urine osmolarity is low, indicating an inability to concentrate or dilute urine in the setting of ATN.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have risen significantly, indicating renal dysfunction. Severe 95% right renal artery stenosis was found and treated with stenting on 04/26. The worsening creatinine may be due to contrast exposure during the cardiac and renal angiogram, as supported by the presence of granular casts in the urinalysis, which are consistent with ATN.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has decreased oxygen saturation and bilateral moderate pleural effusions, likely secondary to congestive"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease.
- She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but experienced pneumonia and was transferred to the CCU.
- The patient has several medical complications, including hyponatremia, acute renal failure (ARF), pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- She underwent renal artery stenting and coronary angiography, with overlapping bare metal stents placed in the left circumflex artery.
- The patient's sodium levels initially improved but then worsened again, suggesting a diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- Her urine osmolality was low, indicating an inability to concentrate or dilute urine in the setting of ATN.
- The patient also has severe renal artery stenosis, which may have contributed to her ARF.
- She has improving hypoxia due to bilateral moderate pleural effusions, likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed a culprit lesion in the left anterior descending artery, which was treated with a bare metal stent.
- She has a history of mechanical aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation post-cardioversion, hypertension, GERD, and degenerative joint disease.
- The patient requires ongoing management for her various medical conditions, including"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis
   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and was transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Pt was noted to have hyponatremia and thought was that
   she was intravascularly dry after diuresis with lasix gtt, therefore
   her lasix gtt was held.  Her sodium initially improved, but trended
   down again.  Calculated fena and feurea were both elevated c/w ATN.
   Urine osms were 299 (not concentrated) which may be because kidneys can
   not concentrate or dilute urine in setting of ATN. Pt currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - fluid restrict 1.5 L
   - 2gm sodium diet
   - continue to trend
   - if continues to worsen or becomes symptomatic consider cautious
   administration of hypertonic saline
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - fluid restrict per above
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural
   effusions, L sided loculated, and resolving multifocal PNA. Etiology of
   effusions most likely CHF, however, parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx.
   Latter is unlikely given white count trending down and pt has been
   afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less likely as we have a good reason
   for the hypoxia.
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - If patient spikes again or decompensates will call IR again to
   perform diagnostic thoracentesis
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin (81 mg given hep and Coumadin), plavix, atorvastatin
   40
   - Restart metoprolol 12.5 PO BID if pressures and heart rate allow
   #. history of AS s/p mechanical AVR: in [**2199**]. Last TTE shows EF >50%,
   [**1-30**]+MR, 3+TR.   INR today 1.8.
   - Continue heparin gtt bridge
   - continue warfarin goal presumed to be 2.5-3.5
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with h/o Afib s/p cardioversion.
   Currently in NSR.
   - hep gtt and Coumadin as above
   - continue amiodarone, restart  metoprolol  as above
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - restarting metoprolol at low dose and titrate up

She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but experienced complications including pneumonia and acute renal failure. She was transferred to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which could be due to intravascular volume depletion after diuretic use. It is important to monitor sodium levels and consider cautious administration of hypertonic saline if the condition worsens or becomes symptomatic.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function worsened in the setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, possibly due to IV contrast. There are granular casts in her urine consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Fluid restriction, dietary modifications, and medication adjustments should be made accordingly.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has improving hypoxia likely secondary to bilateral moderate pleural effusions. This could be due to congestive heart failure or parapneumonic/empyema. Further diagnostic thoracentesis may be necessary if the patient's condition deteriorates.
4. Coronary Artery Disease/NSTEMI: The patient underwent overlapping bare metal stents to the left circumflex artery and could not open a chronic total occlusion of the right omohyoid artery."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis
   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and was transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Pt was noted to have hyponatremia and thought was that
   she was intravascularly dry after diuresis with lasix gtt, therefore
   her lasix gtt was held.  Her sodium initially improved, but trended
   down again.  Calculated fena and feurea were both elevated c/w ATN.
   Urine osms were 299 (not concentrated) which may be because kidneys can
   not concentrate or dilute urine in setting of ATN. Pt currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - fluid restrict 1.5 L
   - 2gm sodium diet
   - continue to trend
   - if continues to worsen or becomes symptomatic consider cautious
   administration of hypertonic saline
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - fluid restrict per above
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural
   effusions, L sided loculated, and resolving multifocal PNA. Etiology of
   effusions most likely CHF, however, parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx.
   Latter is unlikely given white count trending down and pt has been
   afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less likely as we have a good reason
   for the hypoxia.
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - If patient spikes again or decompensates will call IR again to
   perform diagnostic thoracentesis
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin (81 mg given hep and Coumadin), plavix, atorvastatin
   40
   - Restart metoprolol 12.5 PO BID if pressures and heart rate allow
   #. history of AS s/p mechanical AVR: in [**2199**]. Last TTE shows EF >50%,
   [**1-30**]+MR, 3+TR.   INR today 1.8.
   - Continue heparin gtt bridge
   - continue warfarin goal presumed to be 2.5-3.5
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with h/o Afib s/p cardioversion.
   Currently in NSR.
   - hep gtt and Coumadin as above
   - continue amiodarone, restart  metoprolol  as above
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - restarting metoprolol at low dose and titrate up
   .
   #. GERD: Stable.
   - changed pantoprazole to ranitidine and renally dosed
   - giving TUMS for symptoms of heartburn (do not want to give Maalox
   given renal dysfunction)

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but was complicated by pneumonia and acute kidney injury. She underwent cardiac catheterization and placement of a stent to her left circumflex artery. Her current medical issues include hyponatremia, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and myocardial infarction. She is also on multiple medications for various conditions such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels in her blood, which can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, diuretic use, or kidney dysfunction. It is important to monitor her sodium levels closely and make appropriate adjustments to her fluid and medication regimen.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's kidney function has worsened, likely due to the use of contrast dye during the cardiac catheterization. This can cause acute tubular necrosis (ATN), leading to decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels. Fluid restriction, renal diet, and careful monitoring of medications are necessary to manage this condition.

3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of fluid accumulation in her lungs, leading to shortness of breath and decreased oxygen saturation. This could be due to heart failure or"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, PVD, and renal artery stenosis. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but experienced complications including pneumonia and myocardial infarction. She was transferred to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient is hyponatremic with a sodium level of 26 mEq/L. This may be due to euvolemic to hypervolemic hyponatremia, likely caused by free water excess in the setting of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has worsened since the cardiac and renal angiogram, possibly due to IV contrast. Urinalysis supports the diagnosis of ATN, and fluid restriction, renal diet, and medication adjustment are recommended.

3. Hypoxia: The patient is improving but initially had hypoxia due to bilateral moderate pleural effusions and multifocal pneumonia. Etiology of effusions is most likely congestive heart failure (CHF), but parapneumonic/emypema is less likely given the downward trend in white blood cell count and absence of fever. Antibiotic course is complete, and nebulizers and mucolytics are"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis
   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and was transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Probably euvolemic to hypervolemic hyponatremia. This
   is most likely multifactorial with free water excess in the setting of
   ATN. This is evidenced by urine sodium and potassium of 71 meQ, which
   is 40% of the serum sodium concentration, with a urine output of 1300
   will give you roughly 500cc of free water loss. The urine sodium is too
   low for SIADH however high urine osms compared to sesrum osms is
   suggestive of a concominant SIADH. Salt wasting nephropathy is very
   rare and would be less likely than simple free water excess caused by
   the heparin gtt (300cc of D5W/day).
   - Changed heparin drip to normal saline instead of D5W
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - tighter fluid restriction from 1.5 L to 1 L per day
   - 2gm sodium diet
   - continue to trend
   - Now that pt with symptoms would consider cautious administration of
   hypertonic saline, however will need better access which has been a
   problem. [**Name (NI) **] have ongoing discussions with renal, appreciate their
   input greatly
   - Will stay in CCU one more day given unstable urine sodium
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - fluid restrict per above
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural
   effusions, L sided loculated, and resolving multifocal PNA. Etiology of
   effusions most likely CHF, however, parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx.
   Latter is unlikely given white count trending down and pt has been
   afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less likely as we have a good reason
   for the hypoxia. Part of the reason is a poor pleth.
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin (81 mg given hep and Coumadin), plavix, atorvastatin
   40
   - Restart metoprolol 12.5 PO BID given HTN
   - Restart Imdur at half dose given HTN
   - If still hypertensive, would consider amlodipine 5mg PO Daily

   #. Dispo: CCU until hyponatremia stabilizes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), renal artery stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram, but the procedure was complicated by pneumonia and she was transferred to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient's current health progress in the ICU includes the following potential medical complications:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely euvolemic to hypervolemic. It may be due to free water excess in the setting of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The urine sodium and potassium levels suggest that salt wasting nephropathy is less likely, and there is a possibility of concomitant syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The patient's sodium levels will be monitored, and fluid restriction, a low-sodium diet, and hypertonic saline administration may be considered based on symptoms.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has ARF, possibly caused by IV contrast during the cardiac and renal angiogram, as well as underlying severe renal artery stenosis. The urine analysis shows granular casts consistent with ATN. Renal replacement therapy, fluid restriction, a renal diet, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient was referred for right renal artery stenting and coronary angiography. However, the procedure was complicated by a transfer to the CCU after catheterization and placement of a stent to the left circumflex. The patient has been experiencing hyponatremia, which may be multifactorial in nature, including acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and free water excess. It is mentioned that there is no role for ADH receptor antagonist at this time, and the sodium levels should be continued to be trended without using hypertonic saline unless clear symptoms are present.

The patient has allergies to ciprofloxacin and has received various medications, including heparin sodium, ranitidine, and Coumadin (warfarin). The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for some noted below.

Flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and peripheral vascular examination. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a slight variation in heart rate and oxygen saturation levels. The patient's weight has increased since admission. Total intake and output are documented, along with urine output. Oxygen delivery is through a nasal cannula, and the patient's ABG results are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and laboratory results. Notably, the patient's peripheral pulses, skin, movement, tone, and most neurological assessments"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis
   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and was transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # GI bleed: Unclear etiology, given red coloration, this is suggestive
   of lower GI bleed. The lack of pain would suspect diverticulosis
   exacerbated by constipation and anticoagulation. Ddx includes AVM,
   colonic cancer.
   - Hold heparin gtt until HCT stabilizes
   - Transfuse 1 units PRBCs
   - Consider lasix after transfusion based on O2/respiratory status
   - Keep active type and screen
   - Maintain two large bore peripheral IVs
   - guiac all stools
   - Will remain in CCU given bleed
   # Hyponatremia: Probably euvolemic to hypervolemic hyponatremia. This
   is most likely multifactorial with free water excess in the setting of
   ATN. This is evidenced by urine sodium and potassium of 71 meQ, which
   is 40% of the serum sodium concentration, with a urine output of 1300
   will give you roughly 500cc of free water loss. The urine sodium is too
   low for SIADH however high urine osms compared to sesrum osms is
   suggestive of a concominant SIADH. Salt wasting nephropathy is very
   rare and would be less likely than simple free water excess caused by
   the heparin gtt (300cc of D5W/day).
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - tighter fluid restriction from 1.5 L to 1 L per day
   - 2gm sodium diet
   - continue to trend
   - Monitor for symptoms
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - fluid restrict per above
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural
   effusions, L sided loculated, and resolving multifocal PNA. Etiology of
   effusions most likely CHF, however, parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx.
   Latter is unlikely given white count trending down and pt has been
   afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less likely as we have a good reason
   for the hypoxia. Part of the reason is a poor pleth. Not improving.
   - Repeat CXR to r/o reversible causes such as edema, or infiltrate
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin (81 mg given hep and Coumadin), plavix, atorvastatin
   40
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 PO BID given HTN
   - Restart Imdur at half dose given HTN
   - If still hypertensive, would consider amlodipine 5mg PO Daily
   - Low threshold to hold antihypertensives if HCT drops more acutely or
   pt shows any signs of hemodynamic instability
   #. history of AS s/p mechanical AVR: in [**2199**]. Last TTE shows EF >50%,
   [**1-30**]+MR, 3+TR.
   - Hold heparin gtt
   - Hold warfarin
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with h/o Afib s/p cardioversion.
   Currently in NSR.
   - Hold hep gtt and Coumadin as above
   - continue amiodarone, restart  metoprolol as above
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - Plan per above (see CAD)
   .
   #. GERD: Stable.
   - changed pantoprazole to ranitidine and renally dosed
   - giving TUMS for symptoms of heartburn (do not want to give Maalox
   given renal dysfunction)
   .
   #. Thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter: Continue home Levothyroxine.
   .

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis
   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and was transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # GI bleed: Unclear etiology, given the lack of pain would suspect
   diverticulosis exacerbated by constipation and anticoagulation. Ddx
   includes AVM, colonic cancer.
   - Hold heparin gtt until HCT stabilizes
   - Transfuse 2 units PRBCs
   - Consider lasix after transfusion
   - Keep active type and screen
   - Maintain two large bore peripheral IVs
   - guiac all stools
   - Will remain in CCU given bleed
   # Hyponatremia: Probably euvolemic to hypervolemic hyponatremia. This
   is most likely multifactorial with free water excess in the setting of
   ATN. This is evidenced by urine sodium and potassium of 71 meQ, which
   is 40% of the serum sodium concentration, with a urine output of 1300
   will give you roughly 500cc of free water loss. The urine sodium is too
   low for SIADH however high urine osms compared to sesrum osms is
   suggestive of a concominant SIADH. Salt wasting nephropathy is very
   rare and would be less likely than simple free water excess caused by
   the heparin gtt (300cc of D5W/day).
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - tighter fluid restriction from 1.5 L to 1 L per day
   - 2gm sodium diet
   - continue to trend
   - Monitor for symptoms
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - fluid restrict per above
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural
   effusions, L sided loculated, and resolving multifocal PNA. Etiology of
   effusions most likely CHF, however, parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx.
   Latter is unlikely given white count trending down and pt has been
   afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less likely as we have a good reason
   for the hypoxia. Part of the reason is a poor pleth.
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin (81 mg given hep and Coumadin), plavix, atorvastatin
   40
   - Restart metoprolol 12.5 PO BID given HTN
   - Restart Imdur at half dose given HTN
   - If still hypertensive, would consider amlodipine 5mg PO Daily
   #. history of AS s/p mechanical AVR: in [**2199**]. Last TTE shows EF >50%,
   [**1-30**]+MR, 3+TR.
   - Hold heparin gtt
   - Hold warfarin
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with h/o Afib s/p cardioversion.
   Currently in NSR.
   - Hold hep gtt and Coumadin as above
   - continue amiodarone, restart  metoprolol as above
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - Plan per above (see CAD)
   .
   #. GERD: Stable.
   - changed pantoprazole to ranitidine and renally dosed
   - giving TUMS for symptoms of heartburn (do not want to give Maalox
   given renal dysfunction)
   .
   #. Thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter: Continue home Levothyroxine.
   .
   #. Urinary Dysfunction: Continue home Terazosin, Oxybutynin per home
   regimen.
   .
   #. Degenerative joint disease: Pain control with Tylenol as per home

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of diverticulosis, constipation, and anticoagulation, which increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The current assessment suggests that the etiology of the GI bleed may be unclear, but it is suspected to be due to diverticulosis exacerbated by constipation and anticoagulation. The differential diagnosis includes arteriovenous malformation (AVM), colonic cancer, and other causes.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient is experiencing low sodium levels, which can be caused by various factors such as free water excess, SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone), or salt wasting nephropathy. The assessment suggests that the hyponatremia is most likely multifactorial with free water excess in the setting of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The recommended plan includes monitoring sodium levels, tighter fluid restriction, a 2gm sodium diet, and close observation for symptoms.

3. ARF (acute renal failure): The patient has a history of severe renal artery stenosis, which has been treated with stenting. The recent worsening of creatinine levels suggests possible acute renal failure, possibly due to IV contrast exposure during cardiac and renal angiogram. The recommended plan includes trending creatinine levels, renal recommendations, fluid restriction, renal diet, and renally dosed"

   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and was transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # GI bleed: Unclear etiology, given red coloration, this is suggestive
   of lower GI bleed. The lack of pain would suspect diverticulosis
   exacerbated by constipation and anticoagulation. Ddx includes AVM,
   colonic cancer.
   - Hold heparin gtt until HCT stabilizes
   - Transfuse 1 units PRBCs
   - Consider lasix after transfusion based on O2/respiratory status
   - Keep active type and screen
   - Maintain two large bore peripheral IVs
   - guiac all stools
   - Will remain in CCU given bleed
   # Hyponatremia: Probably euvolemic to hypervolemic hyponatremia. This
   is most likely multifactorial with free water excess in the setting of
   ATN. This is evidenced by urine sodium and potassium of 71 meQ, which
   is 40% of the serum sodium concentration, with a urine output of 1300
   will give you roughly 500cc of free water loss. The urine sodium is too
   low for SIADH however high urine osms compared to sesrum osms is
   suggestive of a concominant SIADH. Salt wasting nephropathy is very
   rare and would be less likely than simple free water excess caused by
   the heparin gtt (300cc of D5W/day).
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - tighter fluid restriction from 1.5 L to 1 L per day
   - 2gm sodium diet
   - continue to trend
   - Monitor for symptoms
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - fluid restrict per above
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural
   effusions, L sided loculated, and resolving multifocal PNA. Etiology of
   effusions most likely CHF, however, parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx.
   Latter is unlikely given white count trending down and pt has been
   afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less likely as we have a good reason
   for the hypoxia. Part of the reason is a poor pleth. Not improving.
   - Repeat CXR to r/o reversible causes such as edema, or infiltrate
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin (81 mg given hep and Coumadin), plavix, atorvastatin
   40
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 PO BID given HTN
   - Restart Imdur at half dose given HTN
   - If still hypertensive, would consider amlodipine 5mg PO Daily
   - Low threshold to hold antihypertensives if HCT drops more acutely or
   pt shows any signs of hemodynamic instability
   #. history of AS s/p mechanical AVR: in [**2199**]. Last TTE shows EF >50%,
   [**1-30**]+MR, 3+TR.
   - Hold heparin gtt
   - Hold warfarin
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with h/o Afib s/p cardioversion.
   Currently in NSR.
   - Hold hep gtt and Coumadin as above
   - continue amiodarone, restart  metoprolol as above
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - Plan per above (see CAD)
   .
   #. GERD: Stable.
   - changed pantoprazole to ranitidine and renally dosed
   - giving TUMS for symptoms of heartburn (do not want to give Maalox
   given renal dysfunction)
   .
   #. Thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter: Continue home Levothyroxine.
   .
   #. Urinary Dysfunction: Continue home Terazosin, Oxybutynin per home

   #. Dispo: CCU until GI bleed and hyponatremia stabilizes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of multiple medical conditions including aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), renal artery stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but experienced complications including pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleed, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, and myocardial infarction.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of constipation and anticoagulation, which increases the risk of lower gastrointestinal bleed. It is important to monitor for signs of bleeding, such as red-colored stool, abdominal pain, and low hemoglobin levels. The patient should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth), and the heparin infusion should be held until hemoglobin levels stabilize. Transfusion of packed red blood cells may be necessary, and lasix should be avoided until the oxygenation status is assessed. An active type and screen should be maintained, and guaiac tests should be done on all stools.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient is experiencing hyponatremia, which is likely euvolemic to hypervolemic in nature. This could be due to free water excess in the setting of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It is important to"

   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - fluid restrict per above
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance

   # Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural
   effusions, L sided loculated, and resolving multifocal PNA. Etiology of
   effusions most likely CHF, however, parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx.
   Latter is unlikely given white count trending down and pt has been
   afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less likely as we have a good reason
   for the hypoxia. Part of the reason is a poor pleth.
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - Pan cultures remain negative

   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.

   #. Dispo: CCU until hyponatremia stabilizes
","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram complicated by pneumonia and was transferred to the CCU post catheterization.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. GI bleed: The patient is suspected to have a gastrointestinal bleed, possibly due to diverticulosis exacerbated by constipation and anticoagulation. The differential diagnosis includes arteriovenous malformation (AVM), colonic cancer. The plan includes holding heparin, transfusing 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), considering Lasix after transfusion, maintaining two large bore peripheral IVs, and guaiac testing all stools.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is most likely euvolemic to hypervolemic. It is multifactorial with free water excess in the setting of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The urine sodium and potassium levels suggest a concomitant syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The plan includes monitoring sodium with Hospital 1 lytes, tighter fluid restriction from 1.5 L to 1 L per day, a 2 gm sodium diet, and continuing to trend sodium levels.

   gtt and warfarin without a bolus
   - TID HCTs
   - Keep active type and screen
   - Maintain two large bore peripheral IVs
   - guiac all stools
   - Pantoprazole 40mg IV Q24H for one more day, if HCT remains stable can
   DC tomorrow
   # Hyponatremia: Improving. Probably euvolemic to hypervolemic
   hyponatremia. This is most likely multifactorial with free water excess
   in the setting of ATN. The urine sodium is too low for SIADH however
   high urine osms compared to sesrum osms is suggestive of a concominant
   SIADH. Salt wasting nephropathy is very rare and would be less likely
   than simple free water excess caused by the heparin gtt (300cc of
   D5W/day).
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue tighter fluid restriction from 1.5 L to 1 L per day
   - 2gm sodium diet
   - continue to trend
   - Monitor for symptoms
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - fluid restrict per above
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural
   effusions, L sided loculated, and resolving multifocal PNA. Etiology of
   effusions most likely CHF, however, parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx.
   Latter is unlikely given white count trending down and pt has been
   afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less likely as we have a good reason
   for the hypoxia. Part of the reason is a poor pleth. Not improving.
   - f/u final read CXR
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   - Consider trial of diuresis, perhaps when hyponatremia stabilizes
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin (81 mg given hep and Coumadin), plavix, atorvastatin
   40
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 PO BID given HTN
   - Restart Imdur at half dose given HTN
   - If still hypertensive, would consider amlodipine 5mg PO Daily
   - Low threshold to hold antihypertensives if HCT drops more acutely or
   pt shows any signs of hemodynamic instability
   #. history of AS s/p mechanical AVR: in [**2199**]. Last TTE shows EF >50%,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities including aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but was complicated by pneumonia and transferred to the CCU. The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require management:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has evidence of lower gastrointestinal bleed, possibly due to diverticulosis exacerbated by anticoagulation. It is important to monitor hemoglobin levels, recheck hematocrit at 1 pm, and restart heparin and warfarin without a bolus if stable.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has improving hyponatremia, likely due to euvolemic to hypervolemic free water excess in the setting of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It is important to monitor sodium levels, continue fluid restriction to 1 L per day, maintain a 2-g sodium diet, and trend creatinine.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has severe renal artery stenosis that was stented, but her creatinine worsened after cardiac and renal angiogram, possibly due to IV contrast. There are granular casts consistent with ATN, and the patient made good urine on lasix gtt but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine. It is important to trend creatinine, seek"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease.
- She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but was complicated by pneumonia and transferred to the CCU.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including gastrointestinal bleed, hypoxemia, impaired physical mobility, hyponatremia, anxiety, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), and myocardial infarction.
- She underwent renal artery stenting for severe renal artery stenosis.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 147/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,394 mL, with 960 mL given through the oral route, 84 mL through intravenous fluids, and 350 mL of blood products transfused.
- The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels.
- The patient has ongoing issues with gastrointestinal bleed, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, hypoxemia, and pneumonia.
- The patient is on various medications including heparin, pantoprazole, metoprolol, atorvastatin, aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin.
- The plan is to monitor sodium levels, continue fluid restriction, trend creatinine levels, and involve a renal consult.
- The patient's history of AS post mechanical AVR, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter, urinary dysfunction, degenerative joint disease, and cholesterol emboli to the left eye are also noted.
- ICU care includes cardiac HH diet, pain control with Tylenol, bowel regimen with Senna and Colace, and DVT prophylaxis with heparin gtt/coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient is at risk of further bleeding due to the ongoing lower gastrointestinal bleed. Close monitoring of hemodynamic stability and continuation of GI precautions are necessary.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia needs to be carefully monitored and managed to avoid potential neurological complications. Fluid restriction and sodium supplementation may be required.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Monitoring renal function and involvement of a renal consultant for further management are essential.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation requires continued monitoring and treatment of underlying causes such as pneumonia or pleural effusions.
5. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent worsening of respiratory status.
6. Myocardial infarction: The patient's recent myocardial infarction requires ongoing cardiac monitoring and management of any associated complications.
7. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema needs to be managed with appropriate diuretics and monitoring of fluid status.
8. Renal artery stenosis: The patient's history of severe renal artery stenosis requires ongoing monitoring of renal function and blood pressure control.
9. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation needs to be managed with anticoagulation and rate control medications.
10. GERD: The patient's GERD symptoms should be managed with continued use of pantoprazole and symptomatic treatment.
11. Thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter: The patient's thyroid condition requires ongoing management with levothyroxine.
12. Urinary dysfunction: The patient's urinary dysfunction should be managed with continued use of terazosin and oxybutynin.
13. Degenerative joint disease: The patient's pain related to degenerative joint disease should be managed with Tylenol as per home regimen.
14. Cholesterol emboli to the left eye: The patient's history of cholesterol emboli to the left eye requires continued anticoagulation and statin therapy.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5115**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis
   s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN,
   GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal
   angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and was transferred to the CCU s/p
   cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # GI bleed: Unclear etiology, given red coloration, this is suggestive
   of lower GI bleed. The lack of pain would suspect diverticulosis
   exacerbated by constipation and anticoagulation. Ddx includes AVM,
   colonic cancer.
   - Recheck HCT at 1pm, if stable, then would favor restarting heparin
   gtt and warfarin without a bolus
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCTs
   - Keep active type and screen
   - Maintain two large bore peripheral IVs
   - guiac all stools
   - Pantoprazole 40mg IV Q24H
   # Hyponatremia: Improving. Probably euvolemic to hypervolemic
   hyponatremia. This is most likely multifactorial with free water excess
   in the setting of ATN. The urine sodium is too low for SIADH however
   high urine osms compared to sesrum osms is suggestive of a concominant
   SIADH. Salt wasting nephropathy is very rare and would be less likely
   than simple free water excess caused by the heparin gtt (300cc of
   D5W/day).
   - Monitor sodium with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue tighter fluid restriction from 1.5 L to 1 L per day
   - 2gm sodium diet
   - continue to trend
   - Monitor for symptoms
   # ARF on CKD/Renal Artery Stenosis: Patient with severe 95% R renal
   artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**]. Creatinine worsened in
   setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV
   contrast, U/A supports this with granular casts c/w ATN. Pt made good
   urine on lasix gtt, but became hyponatremic and elevated creatinine so
   this was stopped.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - fluid restrict per above
   - Renal diet (low K and low phos)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
 ask pharmacy for assistance
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely [**3-2**] bilateral moderate pleural
   effusions, L sided loculated, and resolving multifocal PNA. Etiology of
   effusions most likely CHF, however, parapneumonic/emypema in the ddx.
   Latter is unlikely given white count trending down and pt has been
   afebrile. Abx course complete. PE less likely as we have a good reason
   for the hypoxia. Part of the reason is a poor pleth. Not improving.
   - f/u final read CXR
   - Nebs and mucolytics
   - Pan cultures remain negative
   - Consider trial of diuresis, perhaps when hyponatremia stabilizes
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  Had overlapping BMSx2 to LCx and could not open chronic
   total occlusion of OM1.  Post-cath chest pain and anterior ST changes
   suggestive of LAD as site of culprit lesion for chest pain.  Upon
   return to the cath lab again could not open chronic total OM1
   occlusion, instead placed BMS to mid LAD calcified 80% lesion that had
   collaterals to inferior wall. Pt returned to floor CP free.
   - continue aspirin (81 mg given hep and Coumadin), plavix, atorvastatin
   40
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 PO BID given HTN
   - Restart Imdur at half dose given HTN
   - If still hypertensive, would consider amlodipine 5mg PO Daily
   - Low threshold to hold antihypertensives if HCT drops more acutely or
   pt shows any signs of hemodynamic instability
   #. history of AS s/p mechanical AVR: in [**2199**]. Last TTE shows EF >50%,
   [**1-30**]+MR, 3+TR.
   - Restart heparin gtt if PM HCT remains stable
   - Restart warfarin if PM HCT remains stable
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with h/o Afib s/p cardioversion.
   Currently in NSR.
   - Restart hep gtt and Coumadin as above
   - continue amiodarone, restart  metoprolol as above
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - Plan per above (see CAD)
   .
   #. GERD: Stable.
   - pantoprazole 40mg IV Q24H
   - giving TUMS for symptoms of heartburn (do not want to give Maalox
   given renal dysfunction)
   .
   #. Thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter: Continue home Levothyroxine.
   .
   #. Urinary Dysfunction: Continue home Terazosin, Oxybutynin per home
   regimen.
   .
   #. Degenerative joint disease: Pain control with Tylenol as per home
   regimen.
   .
   #. s/p cholesterol emboli to left eye:
   - continue anticoagulation and statin
   .

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and peripheral vascular disease.
- She presented for elective coronary and renal angiogram but was complicated by pneumonia and transferred to the CCU.
- The patient has several medical complications, including gastrointestinal bleed (lower), hypoxemia, impaired physical mobility, hyponatremia (low sodium), impaired health maintenance, anxiety, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia (hospital-acquired).
- The patient underwent renal artery stenting and coronary angiography, with subsequent placement of a stent to the left circumflex artery.
- She received a PICC line on [2202-5-12] at 06:00 PM and had a left brachial line from [2202-5-12] to [2202-5-13].
- The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/50-184/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- Physical examination revealed dry mucous membranes, flat jugular venous pulse, regular heart rhythm, prominent S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, and rales at the lung bases bil"
