","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, septic shock, and renal failure. The patient is intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 100% and PEEP of 16. He is receiving multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure and has been started on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) for renal failure. The patient's condition is complicated by mixed acidosis, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure, and severe sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires ongoing respiratory support with mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.

2. Sepsis and Septic Shock: The patient is suffering from severe sepsis with hemodynamic instability. There is a risk of progression to septic shock, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially death. Continuous monitoring and aggressive management of infection and inflammation are crucial.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and his current condition indicates anuria (lack of urine output). CVVH has been initiated to manage renal failure, but there is a risk of complications such as hypotension, bleeding, or infection related to the vascular"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe systemic infection, multi-organ dysfunction, and respiratory failure. He has been receiving aggressive antibiotic therapy, hemodynamic support, and renal replacement therapy. Despite these interventions, the patient's condition remains unstable, and there are concerns about potential complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute kidney injury (AKI), and septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's low platelet count (74 K/uL) and elevated D-dimer levels indicate the possibility of DIC. DIC is a serious complication that can lead to bleeding or clotting abnormalities.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels (2.8-3.2 mg/dL) and decreased urine output suggest AKI. AKI can be caused by sepsis, dehydration, or medications. It is important to monitor renal function and consider renal replacement therapy if necessary.

3. Septic Shock: The patient's persistent fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated inflammatory markers indicate ongoing septic shock. Septic shock is a life-threatening complication that requires immediate intervention to improve tissue perfusion and organ function.

4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's immobilization and risk factors, there is a concern for PE. A CT pulmonary angi"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y/o male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, likely
   PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen
   saturation while in the emergency room. He required intubation
   following paralysis.  Despite this treatment he continues to be hypoxic
   with a respiatory acidosis on ABG.  He is currently requiring PEEP of
   12 with mean airway of 37.  This picture is likely an acute respiratory
   failure due to V/Q mismatch in the context of acute pneumonia in a
   substrate of a patient with emphysema and chronic lung damage from
   repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.  Differential
   includes PE (CTA not performed) in context of autoimmune inflammation,
   and any of a number of lung infections as patient has long history of
   multiple infections.
   - Continue to adjust ventilatory settings to aim for O2 saturation
   88-92% given COPD history
   - Weaning FiO2 as tolerated, PEEP down to 16 (if hypoxic, could go back
   to 24)
   - Trend ABGs
   - Continue albuterol/ipratroprium
   - COPD flare treatment with Solumedrol 125 mg IV Q8H (consider decrease
   to 80 mg IV this AM)
   - Chest PT when tolerated
   - Daily CXR
   - Antibiotics as below.
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: Likely secondary to infection.  Does not seem to
   cardiogenic in etiology. Normal HCT, no evidence of hemolysis or
   bleeding on labs today.  Differential would include adrenal
   insufficiency (especially in context of acute illness). Was on triple
   pressors; now down to two.
   - Levophed/vasopressin with goal MAP > 55
 wean as tolerated beginning
   with vasopressin
   - Continue fluid resuscitation with aim for consistent UOP
   - Continue high-dose Solumedrol as above
   .
   # Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe infection consistent with
   likely infection.  Given his multiple past infectious the patient
   should be double-covered for pseudomonal infection, stenotrophomonas,
   gram positive infections.
   - Continue empiric Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl
   - Monitor for thrombocytopenia on vanco (history of reaction)
   - On treatment dose bactrim IV given h/o stentotrophomonas
 consider
   D/C
ing this medication today
   - ID consult if micro positive
   # DVT in RLE: Raises the possibility of PE as trigger for acute-onset
   SOB.
   - On heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   - Monitor patient for signs of bleeding (oozing from skin tear on R arm
   where EKG lead was removed)
   - Consider CTA although unclear whether it would change current mgmt
   .
   # Possible Colitis: Unclear etiology.  Will treat empirically with
   flagyl at this time.
   - Send C. diff
   - Consider repeat imaging once patient more stable.
   .
   # Abnormal differential: Could be in context of sepsis, but marked
   abnormalitity raises possibility of underlying lymphoproliferative
   disease, especially given autoimmune diseases and use of azathioprine.
   Normal HCT and platelets decreases the possibility of malignancy.
   - Manual smear
   .
   # Renal failure:  Acute on chronic, with ranges in OMR from 1.8 to 4.
   He is currently at the higher end of this.  Likely secondary to
   pre-renal state in context of hypotension.  Lack of red cells in UA,
   minimal whites suggests that this is not active nephritis from
   Wegener's. Creatinine remains elevated > 3 today. K and phos trending
   up again.
   - F/U renal recs
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - [**Month (only) 60**] require CVVH if unable to control acidosis, volume overload,
   rising K
   .
   # Wegener's Disease:  Currently on azathioprine.  Have given IV
   solumedrol for COPD which should help--does have active lesions on
   imaging today.
   - F/U rheum recs, if any new
   .
   # L2 fracture, avascular necrosis of hip: Both in context of steroid
   use, later may be also in context of hypoxia given global ischemia.
   Patient will have evaluation by orthopedics and spine once more stable.
   .
   # Androgen deficiency: Continue androgel.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF given resuscitation to date and volume with other
   transfusions, replete electrolytes, regular diet

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, and likely pneumonia. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen saturation while in the emergency room and required intubation. Despite this treatment, he continues to be hypoxic with respiratory acidosis on ABG. The cause of acute respiratory failure is likely an acute pneumonia in a substrate of a patient with emphysema and chronic lung damage from repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis. Differential includes PE (CTA not performed) in the context of autoimmune inflammation, and any number of lung infections as the patient has a long history of multiple infections.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension secondary to infection. There is no evidence of cardiogenic etiology. Normal HCT, no evidence of hemolysis or bleeding on labs today. Differential would include adrenal insufficiency (especially in the context of acute illness). The patient is currently on triple pressors and will be weaned as tolerated, beginning with vasopressin. Levophed/vasopressin with goal MAP > 55.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has a left lower lobe infection consistent with likely infection. Given his multiple past infections, the patient should be double-covered for pseudomonal infection, stenotrophomonas, and gram"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y/o male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, likely
   PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen
   saturation while in the emergency room. He required intubation
   following paralysis.  Despite this treatment he continues to be hypoxic
   with a respiatory acidosis on ABG.  He is currently requiring PEEP of
   12 with mean airway of 37.  This picture is likely an acute respiratory
   failure due to V/Q mismatch in the context of acute pneumonia in a
   substrate of a patient with emphysema and chronic lung damage from
   repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.  Differential
   includes PE (CTA not performed) in context of autoimmune inflammation,
   and any of a number of lung infections as patient has long history of
   multiple infections.
   - Continue to adjust ventilatory settings to aim for O2 saturation
   88-92% given COPD history
   - Weaning FiO2 as tolerated (try to go to 70%)
   - Trend ABGs
   - Continue albuterol/ipratroprium
   - send sputum for cx
   - COPD flare treatment with Solumedrol 125 mg IV Q8H (consider decrease
   to 80 mg IV this AM)
   - Chest PT when tolerated
   - Stat CXR now to confirm ET tube position, Daily CXR
   - Antibiotics as below
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: Likely secondary to infection.  Does not seem to
   cardiogenic in etiology. Normal HCT, no evidence of hemolysis or
   bleeding on labs today.  Also likely superimposed adrenal insufficiency
   (especially in context of acute illness). Was on triple pressors; now
   down to two.
   - Levophed/vasopressin with goal MAP > 60
 wean as tolerated beginning
   with vasopressin
   - recheck CVP to evaluate better intravascular volume
   - Continue fluid resuscitation with aim for consistent UOP
   - Continue high-dose Solumedrol as above
   .
   # Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe infection consistent with
   likely infection.  Given his multiple past infectious the patient
   should be double-covered for pseudomonal infection, stenotrophomonas,
   gram positive infections.
   - Continue empiric Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl
   - check urine legionella
   - Monitor for thrombocytopenia on vanco (history of reaction)
   - On treatment dose bactrim IV given h/o stentotrophomonas
 consider
   D/C
ing this medication today
   - ID consult if micro positive
   # DVT in RLE: Raises the possibility of PE as trigger for acute-onset
   SOB.
   - On heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   - TTE today to evaluate for RV dysfunction
   - Monitor patient for signs of bleeding (oozing from skin tear on R arm
   where EKG lead was removed)
   - no plans for CTA, given borderline renal function, already on heparin
   gtt
   .
   # Mental status: Abnormal neurological exam with unresponsive pupils,
   abnormal respiratory pattern.  DDX cerebral edema in setting of
   metabolic abnormalities, possible intracranial bleed given low
   platelets and heparin gtt.
   - CT head this AM
   - change sedation to propofol from versed, fentanyl
   .
   # Anemia: hematocrit drop from 38 to 28.  DDX dilution in setting of
   aggressive fluid hydration, active bleed
   - Active type and screen
   -  Q8 hr HCT
   - transfuse HCT <25
   - check hemolysis labs
   - check stool for occult blood
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Somewhat early for HIT given
   started on heparin <24 hours ago.  Has history of thrombocytopenia on
   vancomycin.
   - trend TID
   - transfuse <50
   .
   # Possible Colitis: Unclear etiology.  Will treat empirically with
   flagyl at this time.
   - Send C. diff
   - Consider repeat imaging once patient more stable.
   .
   # Abnormal differential: Could be in context of sepsis, but marked
   abnormalitity raises possibility of underlying lymphoproliferative
   disease, especially given autoimmune diseases and use of azathioprine.
   Normal HCT and platelets decreases the possibility of malignancy.
   - Manual smear
   .
   # Renal failure:  Acute on chronic, with ranges in OMR from 1.8 to 4.
   He is currently at the higher end of this.  Likely secondary to
   pre-renal state in context of hypotension.  Lack of red cells in UA,
   minimal whites suggests that this is not active nephritis from
   Wegener's. Creatinine remains elevated > 3 today. K and phos trending
   up again.
   - F/U renal recs
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - [**Month (only) 60**] require CVVH if unable to control acidosis, volume overload,
   rising K
   .
   # Wegener's Disease:  Currently on azathioprine.  Have given IV
   solumedrol for COPD which should help--does have active lesions on
   imaging today.
   - F/U rheum recs, if any new
   .
   # L2 fracture, avascular necrosis of hip: Both in context of steroid
   use, later may be also in context of hypoxia given global ischemia.
   Patient will have evaluation by orthopedics and spine once more stable.
   .
   # Androgen deficiency: Continue androgel.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF given resuscitation to date and volume with other
   transfusions, replete electrolytes, regular diet

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, and likely pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has several medical complications including DVT in the right lower extremity, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, mental status changes, and possible colitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a DVT in the right lower extremity, which raises the possibility of PE as a trigger for acute-onset shortness of breath. 

2. Infection: The patient has left lower lobe infection consistent with pneumonia. He also has a history of multiple infectious episodes, which increases the risk of secondary infections.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to infection and superimposed adrenal insufficiency, especially in the context of acute illness.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia on vancomycin, and now presents with thrombocytopenia again. This could be due to vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia or another cause.

5. Renal failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels and abnormal electrolytes. This could be due to pre-renal state"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with Wegener's granulomatosis who is currently in septic shock, respiratory failure, and has a history of pneumonia. He is also experiencing renal failure and has a known diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type II and chronic renal failure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.7 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 90/52 mmHg to 119/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, creatinine level, lactate level, and troponin-T level. The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated. 

The physical examination reveals cool, mottled extremities, right lower extremity edema, and non-tender, distended abdomen. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, insulin, and heparin. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 0.9, PEEP of 16 cmH2O, and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute.

   TTE ([**2201-3-16**]): PRELIMINARY REPORT:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The patient
   is mechanically ventilated. The IVC is small, consistent with an RA
   pressure of <10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
   are normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   40-45 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with vigorous
   basal contraction. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
   most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
   PRELIMINARY REPORT developed by a Cardiology Fellow. Not
   reviewed/approved by the Attending Echo Physician. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 6079**] was
   notified by telephone on [**2201-3-16**] at 11:15am.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-8-12**], the
   patient is no longer in atrial flutter and the LV function is worse
   although the image quality is poor on the current study.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 y/o male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, likely
   PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen
   saturation while in the emergency room. He required intubation
   following paralysis.  Despite this treatment he continues to be hypoxic
   with a respiatory acidosis on ABG.  This picture is likely an acute
   respiratory failure due to V/Q mismatch in the context of acute
   pneumonia in a substrate of a patient with emphysema and chronic lung
   damage from repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.
   Differential includes PE (CTA not performed) in context of autoimmune
   inflammation, and any of a number of lung infections as patient has
   long history of multiple infections.
   - Continue to adjust ventilatory settings to aim for O2 saturation
   88-92% given COPD history
   - Weaning FiO2 as tolerated (currently fi02 50%)
   - Trend ABGs
   - Continue albuterol/ipratroprium
   - send sputum for cx
   - COPD/Wegener
s flare treatment with Solumedrol 125 mg IV Q8H
   (consider decrease to 80 mg IV this AM)
   - Chest PT when tolerated
   - Daily CXR
   - Antibiotics as below
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: Likely secondary to infection.  Does not seem to
   cardiogenic in etiology.  HCT appears to be stable post transfusion.
   Also likely superimposed adrenal insufficiency (especially in context
   of acute illness). Was on triple pressors; now down to two.
   - neosynephrine/vasopressin with goal MAP > 60
 wean as tolerated
   beginning with vasopressin
   - recheck CVP to evaluate better intravascular volume
   - avoid fluid resuscitation as patient is markedly overloaded (though
   likely intravascularly deplete) with aim for consistent UOP
   - Continue high-dose Solumedrol as above
   .
   # Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe infection consistent with
   likely infection.  Given his multiple past infectious the patient
   should be double-covered for pseudomonal infection, stenotrophomonas,
   gram positive infections.
   - Continue empiric Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl
   - check urine legionella
 negative
   - Monitor for thrombocytopenia on vanco (history of reaction)
   - Off treatment dose bactrim IV given h/o stentotrophomonas
   - F/U ID recs
   .
   # Anemia/dropping hematocrit
 Patient had unexpected hematocrit drop
   from 28
 23.  Patient with bleeding from mouth (biting ET tube),
   coffee ground material from OG.  No other evidence of bleeding.  . Got
   2u PRBC, 2u FFP, 1 unit platelets and bumped appropriately.
   - consider CT torso looking for RP bleed/other evidence of bleeding if
   evidence of rebleeding.
   - monitor HCT Q 8 hours
   - Active T&S
   - Transfuse for HCT < 24
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Started on heparin for LE DVT (no bolus) but
   supratherapeutic after starting.  Trending down this morning.
   - check inhibitor
   - consider heme onc consult if abnormal or if persistent coagulopathy
   # DVT in RLE: Raises the possibility of PE as trigger for acute-onset
   SOB.
   - Off heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80; pt supratherapeutic ptt
   - F/U final TTE read
   - Monitor patient for signs of bleeding (oozing from skin tear on R arm
   where EKG lead was removed)
   - no plans for CTA, given borderline renal function, already on heparin
   gtt
   .
   # Mental status: Abnormal neurological exam with unresponsive pupils,
   abnormal respiratory pattern.  DDX cerebral edema in setting of
   metabolic abnormalities, possible intracranial bleed given low
   platelets and heparin gtt.
   - CT head without any acute findings
   - continue sedation with propofol
   ..
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Somewhat early for HIT given
   started on heparin <24 hours ago.  Has history of thrombocytopenia on
   vancomycin.
   - trend TID
   - transfuse <50
   .
   # Possible Colitis: Unclear etiology.  Will treat empirically with
   flagyl at this time.
   - Send C. diff
   - Consider repeat imaging once patient more stable.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation:  Overnight episodes of AFIB with RVR,  this
   morning rate controlled.
   .
   # Abnormal differential: Could be in context of sepsis, but marked
   abnormalitity raises possibility of underlying lymphoproliferative
   disease, especially given autoimmune diseases and use of azathioprine.
   Normal HCT and platelets decreases the possibility of malignancy.
   - Manual smear
   .
   # Renal failure:  Acute on chronic, with ranges in OMR from 1.8 to 4.
   He is currently at the higher end of this.  Likely secondary to
   pre-renal state in context of hypotension.  Lack of red cells in UA,
   minimal whites suggests that this is not active nephritis from
   Wegener's. Creatinine remains elevated > 3 today. K and phos trending
   up again with dwindling UOP.
   - F/U renal recs
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - [**Month (only) 60**] require CVVH if unable to control acidosis, volume overload,
   rising K
   .
   # Wegener's Disease:  On azathioprine at home; being held currently due
   to low WBC.  Have given IV solumedrol for COPD which should help--does
   have active lesions on imaging today.
   - F/U rheum recs, if any new
   .
   # L2 fracture, avascular necrosis of hip: Both in context of steroid
   use, later may be also in context of hypoxia given global ischemia.
   Patient will have evaluation by orthopedics and spine once more stable.
   .
   # Androgen deficiency: Continue androgel.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF given resuscitation to date and volume with other
   transfusions, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

   TTE ([**2201-3-16**]): PRELIMINARY REPORT:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The patient
   is mechanically ventilated. The IVC is small, consistent with an RA
   pressure of <10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
   are normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   40-45 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with vigorous
   basal contraction. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
   most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
   PRELIMINARY REPORT developed by a Cardiology Fellow. Not
   reviewed/approved by the Attending Echo Physician. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 6079**] was
   notified by telephone on [**2201-3-16**] at 11:15am.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-8-12**], the
   patient is no longer in atrial flutter and the LV function is worse
   although the image quality is poor on the current study.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 y/o male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, likely
   PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen
   saturation while in the emergency room. He required intubation
   following paralysis.  Despite this treatment he continues to be hypoxic
   with a respiatory acidosis on ABG.  This picture is likely an acute
   respiratory failure due to V/Q mismatch in the context of acute
   pneumonia in a substrate of a patient with emphysema and chronic lung
   damage from repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.
   Differential includes PE (CTA not performed) in context of autoimmune
   inflammation, and any of a number of lung infections as patient has
   long history of multiple infections.
   - Continue to adjust ventilatory settings to aim for O2 saturation
   88-92% given COPD history
   - Weaning FiO2 as tolerated (currently fi02 50%)
   - Trend ABGs
   - Continue albuterol/ipratroprium
   - send sputum for cx
   - COPD flare treatment with Solumedrol 125 mg IV Q8H (consider decrease
   to 80 mg IV this AM)
   - Chest PT when tolerated
   - Daily CXR
   - Antibiotics as below
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: Likely secondary to infection.  Does not seem to
   cardiogenic in etiology.  HCT appears to be stable post transfusion.
   Also likely superimposed adrenal insufficiency (especially in context
   of acute illness). Was on triple pressors; now down to two.
   - neosynephrine/vasopressin with goal MAP > 60
 wean as tolerated
   beginning with vasopressin
   - recheck CVP to evaluate better intravascular volume
   - avoid fluid resuscitation as patient is markedly overloaded (though
   likely intravascularly deplete) with aim for consistent UOP
   - Continue high-dose Solumedrol as above
   .
   # Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe infection consistent with
   likely infection.  Given his multiple past infectious the patient
   should be double-covered for pseudomonal infection, stenotrophomonas,
   gram positive infections.
   - Continue empiric Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl
   - check urine legionella
 negative
   - Monitor for thrombocytopenia on vanco (history of reaction)
   - Off treatment dose bactrim IV given h/o stentotrophomonas
   - F/U ID recs
   # Anemia/dropping hematocrit
 Patient had unexpected hematocrit drop
   from 28
 23.  Patient with bleeding from mouth (biting ET tube),
   coffee ground material from OG.  No other evidence of bleeding.  . Got
   2u PRBC, 2u FFP, 1 unit platelets and bumped appropriately.
   - would perform CT abd looking for RP bleed/other evidence of bleeding
   if patient becomes more stable.
   - monitor HCT Q 8 hours
   - Active T&S
   - Transfuse for HCT < 24
   # DVT in RLE: Raises the possibility of PE as trigger for acute-onset
   SOB.
   - Off heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80; pt supratherapeutic ptt
   - F/U final TTE read
   - Monitor patient for signs of bleeding (oozing from skin tear on R arm
   where EKG lead was removed)
   - no plans for CTA, given borderline renal function, already on heparin
   gtt
   .
   # Mental status: Abnormal neurological exam with unresponsive pupils,
   abnormal respiratory pattern.  DDX cerebral edema in setting of
   metabolic abnormalities, possible intracranial bleed given low
   platelets and heparin gtt.
   - CT head without any acute findings
   - continue sedation with propofol
   ..
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Somewhat early for HIT given
   started on heparin <24 hours ago.  Has history of thrombocytopenia on
   vancomycin.
   - trend TID
   - transfuse <50
   .
   # Possible Colitis: Unclear etiology.  Will treat empirically with
   flagyl at this time.
   - Send C. diff
   - Consider repeat imaging once patient more stable.
   .
   # Abnormal differential: Could be in context of sepsis, but marked
   abnormalitity raises possibility of underlying lymphoproliferative
   disease, especially given autoimmune diseases and use of azathioprine.
   Normal HCT and platelets decreases the possibility of malignancy.
   - Manual smear
   .
   # Renal failure:  Acute on chronic, with ranges in OMR from 1.8 to 4.
   He is currently at the higher end of this.  Likely secondary to
   pre-renal state in context of hypotension.  Lack of red cells in UA,
   minimal whites suggests that this is not active nephritis from
   Wegener's. Creatinine remains elevated > 3 today. K and phos trending
   up again with dwindling UOP.
   - F/U renal recs
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - [**Month (only) 60**] require CVVH if unable to control acidosis, volume overload,
   rising K
   .
   # Wegener's Disease:  On azathioprine at home; being held currently due
   to low WBC.  Have given IV solumedrol for COPD which should help--does
   have active lesions on imaging today.
   - F/U rheum recs, if any new
   .
   # L2 fracture, avascular necrosis of hip: Both in context of steroid
   use, later may be also in context of hypoxia given global ischemia.
   Patient will have evaluation by orthopedics and spine once more stable.
   .
   # Androgen deficiency: Continue androgel.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF given resuscitation to date and volume with other
   transfusions, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, and likely pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, shock, pneumonia, anemia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thrombocytopenia, mental status changes, possible colitis, and renal failure. 

The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory acidosis and hypoxia. Efforts are being made to wean off vasopressors and optimize oxygenation. Antibiotics have been started empirically for suspected bacterial infections. 

There are multiple concerns regarding the patient's condition, including bleeding, thrombocytopenia, DVT, renal failure, and possible malignancy. Further diagnostic tests are planned to evaluate these issues. 

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is currently in the ICU pending clinical improvement."

   to shunt, or severe underlying lung disease.  repeat echo with bubble
   study.
   Septic shock:  pressors have been significantly weaned.
   Wegener's:  ANCA still pending.  Will follow up with rheumatology to
   determine if steroids can be weaned.
   Anemia:  dropping Hct now stable
   acute renal failure:  was too coagulopathic for HD line.    K
   improved.  Will discuss about CVVH.
   DVT in RLE:  holding anticoagulation due to coagulopathy and bleeding.
   coagulopathy:  PTT improved.  follow up on mixing study.
   will give bowel regimen to get him moving, so we can start TFs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man with Wegener's disease who was admitted with left-sided infiltrates, respiratory failure, and septic shock. The patient has experienced several complications during his ICU stay.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required significant respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and high levels of FiO2. However, the note indicates that the patient's FiO2 has been weaned, suggesting improvement in respiratory function.

2. Septic shock: The patient was diagnosed with septic shock and required pressors for hemodynamic support. The note mentions that the pressors have been significantly weaned, indicating improvement in the patient's hemodynamic stability.

3. Wegener's disease: The patient has a known history of Wegener's disease, which is a form of vasculitis. The note mentions that ANCA testing is pending, and the plan is to follow up with rheumatology to determine if steroids can be weaned.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been dropping and is now stable. This suggests the development of anemia during the ICU stay.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient developed acute renal failure and was considered too coagulopathic for hemodialysis (HD) line placement. The note also mentions improvement in potassium levels, and the plan is to discuss continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU with hypotension, altered mental status, and acute kidney injury. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including vasopressors, antibiotics, and diuretics. His renal function is being closely monitored, and he is being treated for hyperkalemia with kayexalate and insulin. An echocardiogram shows mildly depressed left ventricular function, mild right ventricular dilation, and borderline function. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, liver enzymes, and lactate, along with low albumin and leukocyte count. He has received multiple blood transfusions and has a history of thrombocytopenia. The patient's condition remains unstable, and potential medical complications include sepsis, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of fever suggest an ongoing infection. Given the patient's immunocompromised state and recent antibiotic use, sepsis remains a concern and should be closely monitored.
2. Multi-organ failure: The patient's elevated lactate level and abnormal kidney function indicate possible multi-organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and organ-specific functions will help identify any further"

   61 y/o male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, likely
   PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen
   saturation while in the emergency room. He required intubation
   following paralysis.  Despite this treatment he continues to be hypoxic
   with a respiatory acidosis on ABG.  This picture is likely an acute
   respiratory failure due to V/Q mismatch in the context of acute
   pneumonia in a substrate of a patient with emphysema and chronic lung
   damage from repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.
   Differential includes PE (CTA not performed) in context of autoimmune
   inflammation, and any of a number of lung infections as patient has
   long history of multiple infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, and likely pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU and has a complex medical history including COPD, DVT, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, possible colitis, and a history of multiple infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen saturation while in the emergency room, requiring intubation. He continues to be hypoxic with respiratory acidosis on ABG, indicating ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe infection consistent with likely pneumonia. He should be double-covered for pseudomonal infection, stenotrophomonas, and gram-positive infections.
3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to infection and possibly superimposed adrenal insufficiency. Close monitoring of blood pressure, fluid balance, and vasopressor requirements is necessary.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic PTT after starting heparin, which may indicate the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Trending down the heparin gtt and considering alternative anticoagulation if necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia on"

   IMAGES / STUDIES:
   TTE [**2201-3-17**]: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
   depressed (LVEF= 40 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal septal
   motion/position. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
   is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal
   image quality. No apparent intracardiac shunt but image quality poor.
   Mildly depressed left ventricular function. Mild right ventricular
   dilation and borderline function. Compared with the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2201-3-16**], the findings are similar.
   CXR [**2201-3-17**]: Of note the left CP angle was not included on the film,
   The visualized left lower lobe with ill-defined opacities is unchanged.
   This is more likely due to hemorrhage. Otherwise there are no changes
   in the right lobe with pleural parenchyma scarring in the right apex.
   Lines and tubes remain in place.

   # Respiratory failure:  The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen
   saturation while in the emergency room. He required intubation
   following paralysis.  Despite this treatment he continues to be hypoxic
   with a respiatory acidosis on ABG.  This picture is likely an acute
   respiratory failure due to V/Q mismatch in the context of acute
   pneumonia in a substrate of a patient with emphysema and chronic lung
   damage from repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.

   inflammation, and any of a number of lung infections as patient has
   long history of multiple infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, likely pneumonia, hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, DVT, mental status changes, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and possible colitis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient developed acute respiratory failure due to V/Q mismatch in the context of acute pneumonia and underlying emphysema and chronic lung damage from repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.
2. Hypotension/shock: Likely secondary to infection and possible superimposed adrenal insufficiency.
3. Anemia: Hematocrit dropped unexpectedly, and the patient required blood transfusions.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient started on heparin for left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but became supratherapeutic.
5. Mental status changes: Abnormal neurological exam with unresponsive pupils and abnormal respiratory pattern.
6. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology, possibly related to heparin therapy or vancomycin.
7. Renal failure: Acute on chronic, with elevated creatinine levels.
8. Possible colitis: Unclear etiology, being treated empirically with Flagyl.
9. Atrial fibrillation: Episodes of AFIB with rapid ventricular response"

   IMAGES / STUDIES:
   TTE [**2201-3-17**]: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
   depressed (LVEF= 40 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal septal
   motion/position. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
   is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal
   image quality. No apparent intracardiac shunt but image quality poor.
   Mildly depressed left ventricular function. Mild right ventricular
   dilation and borderline function. Compared with the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2201-3-16**], the findings are similar.
   CXR [**2201-3-17**]: Of note the left CP angle was not included on the film,
   The visualized left lower lobe with ill-defined opacities is unchanged.
   This is more likely due to hemorrhage. Otherwise there are no changes
   in the right lobe with pleural parenchyma scarring in the right apex.
   Lines and tubes remain in place.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y/o male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, likely
   PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen
   saturation while in the emergency room. He required intubation
   following paralysis.  Despite this treatment he continues to be hypoxic
   with a respiatory acidosis on ABG.  This picture is likely an acute
   respiratory failure due to V/Q mismatch in the context of acute
   pneumonia in a substrate of a patient with emphysema and chronic lung
   damage from repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.
   Differential includes PE (CTA not performed) in context of autoimmune
   inflammation, and any of a number of lung infections as patient has
   long history of multiple infections.
   - Continue to adjust ventilatory settings to aim for O2 saturation
   88-92% given COPD history
   - Weaning FiO2 as tolerated (currently fi02 50%)
   - Trend ABGs
   - Continue albuterol/ipratroprium
   - send sputum for cx
   - COPD/Wegener
s flare treatment with Solumedrol 125 mg IV Q8H
   (consider decrease to 80 mg IV this AM)
   - Chest PT when tolerated
   - Daily CXR
   - Antibiotics as below
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: Likely secondary to infection.  Does not seem to
   cardiogenic in etiology.  HCT appears to be stable post transfusion.
   Also likely superimposed adrenal insufficiency (especially in context
   of acute illness). Was on triple pressors; now down to one.
   - neosynephrine/vasopressin with goal MAP > 60
 wean as tolerated
   beginning with vasopressin
   - Trend CVP to evaluate better intravascular volume (mid-teens; most
   recent 16)
   - avoid fluid resuscitation as patient is markedly overloaded (though
   likely intravascularly deplete) with aim for consistent UOP
   - Continue Solumedrol at 60 IV TID -> decrease by 10 every other day
   (per rheum recs)
   .
   # Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe infection consistent with
   likely infection.  Given his multiple past infectious the patient
   should be double-covered for pseudomonal infection, stenotrophomonas,
   gram positive infections.
   - Continue empiric Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl
   - check urine legionella
 negative
   - Monitor for thrombocytopenia on vanco (history of reaction)
   - Off treatment dose bactrim IV given h/o stentotrophomonas
   - F/U ID recs
   .
   # Anemia/dropping hematocrit
 Patient had unexpected hematocrit drop
   from 28
 23.  Patient with bleeding from mouth (biting ET tube),
   coffee ground material from OG.  No other evidence of bleeding.  . Got
   2u PRBC, 2u FFP, 1 unit platelets and bumped appropriately.
   - consider CT torso looking for RP bleed/other evidence of bleeding if
   evidence of rebleeding.
   - monitor HCT Q 8 hours
   - Active T&S
   - Transfuse for HCT < 24
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Started on heparin for LE DVT (no bolus) but
   supratherapeutic after starting.  Trending down this morning.
   - check inhibitor
   - consider heme onc consult if abnormal or if persistent coagulopathy
   # DVT in RLE: Raises the possibility of PE as trigger for acute-onset
   SOB.
   - Off heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80; pt supratherapeutic ptt
   - F/U final TTE read
   - Monitor patient for signs of bleeding (oozing from skin tear on R arm
   where EKG lead was removed)
   - no plans for CTA, given borderline renal function, already on heparin
   gtt
   .
   # Mental status: Abnormal neurological exam with unresponsive pupils,
   abnormal respiratory pattern.  DDX cerebral edema in setting of
   metabolic abnormalities, possible intracranial bleed given low
   platelets and heparin gtt.
   - CT head without any acute findings
   - continue sedation with propofol
   ..
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Somewhat early for HIT given
   started on heparin <24 hours ago.  Has history of thrombocytopenia on
   vancomycin. Received 1 unit overnight with good response.
   - trend TID
   - transfuse <50
   .
   # Renal failure:  Acute on chronic, with ranges in OMR from 1.8 to 4.
   He is currently at the higher end of this.  Likely secondary to
   pre-renal state in context of hypotension.  Lack of red cells in UA,
   minimal whites suggests that this is not active nephritis from
   Wegener's. Creatinine remains elevated > 3 today. K and phos trending
   up again with dwindling UOP.
   - F/U renal recs
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - Will likely require CVVH today or tomorrow for volume overload,
   unstable electrolytes
   - Give kayexelate if K > 6
   - Check electrolytes in PM
   .
   # Possible Colitis: Unclear etiology.  Will treat empirically with
   flagyl at this time.
   - Send C. diff once stool sample available
   - Consider repeat imaging once patient more stable.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation:  Overnight episodes of AFIB with RVR, this
   morning rate controlled.
   - Will start amiodarone as not currently a candidate for rate control
   .
   # Abnormal differential: Could be in context of sepsis, but marked
   abnormalitity raises possibility of underlying lymphoproliferative
   disease, especially given autoimmune diseases and use of azathioprine.
   Normal HCT and platelets decreases the possibility of malignancy.
   - Manual smear
   .
   # Wegener's Disease:  On azathioprine at home; being held currently due
   to low WBC.  Have given IV solumedrol for COPD which should help--does
   have active lesions on imaging today.
   - F/U rheum recs, if any new
   .
   # L2 fracture, avascular necrosis of hip: Both in context of steroid
   use, later may be also in context of hypoxia given global ischemia.
   Patient will have evaluation by orthopedics and spine once more stable.
   # Constipation: No BM since admission, possibly secondary to ileus.
   Patient has bowel sounds today.
   - Start lactulose PO
   .
   # Androgen deficiency: Continue androgel.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF given resuscitation to date and volume with other
   transfusions, replete electrolytes, contact nutrition to initiate TF

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the underlying chronic lung damage and recurrent infections.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a left lower lobe infection, and there is a risk of progression or development of new infections.
3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension may persist or worsen, leading to further shock.
4. Anemia/Dropping Hematocrit: The patient's anemia and dropping hematocrit levels indicate ongoing bleeding, which could lead to hemodynamic instability.

   Micro: sputum CX:  sparse growth commensal respiratory flora, moderate

Blood CX: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   61 y/o male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, likely
   PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen
   saturation while in the emergency room. He required intubation
   following paralysis.  Despite this treatment he continues to be hypoxic
   with a respiatory acidosis on ABG.  This picture is likely an acute
   respiratory failure due to V/Q mismatch in the context of acute
   pneumonia in a substrate of a patient with emphysema and chronic lung
   damage from repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.
   Differential includes PE (CTA not performed) in context of autoimmune
   inflammation, and any of a number of lung infections as patient has
   long history of multiple infections.
   - Continue to adjust ventilatory settings to aim for O2 saturation
   88-92% given COPD history
   - Weaning FiO2 as tolerated (currently fi02 50%)
   - Trend ABGs
   - Continue albuterol/ipratroprium
   - send sputum for cx
   - COPD/Wegener
s flare treatment with Solumedrol  (125 mg IV Q8H
   mg IV on [**3-17**]) decrease to 50IV TID today
   - Chest PT when tolerated
   - Daily CXR
   - Antibiotics as below
   - Will initiate CVVH today; discontinue lasix
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: Likely secondary to infection.  Does not seem to
   cardiogenic in etiology.  HCT appears to be stable post transfusion.
   Also likely superimposed adrenal insufficiency (especially in context
   of acute illness). Was on triple pressors; now down to one.  Weaning
   from pressors, vasopressin taken off [**2201-3-18**].
   - phenylephrine with goal MAP > 60
   - Trend CVP to evaluate better intravascular volume (mid-teens; most
   recent 16)
   - avoid fluid resuscitation as patient is markedly overloaded (though
   likely intravascularly deplete) with aim for consistent UOP
   - decrease solumedrol to 50 TID -> decrease by 10 every other day (per
   rheum recs)
   .
   # Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe infection consistent with
   likely infection.  Given his multiple past infectious the patient
   should be double-covered for pseudomonal infection, stenotrophomonas,
   gram positive infections.  Rare aspergillus growth in sputum;
   significance unclear (colonization v. infection) in this
   immunosuppressed pt with cavitating nodules seen on initial CT chest.
   - Continue empiric Zosyn/Flagyl
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Off treatment dose bactrim IV given h/o sternotrophomonas
   - Repeat noncontrast CT torso to f/u nodules
   - Send galactomannan and beta glucan
   - F/U ID recs
   # Oliguric Renal failure:  Acute on chronic, with ranges in OMR from
   1.8 to 4.  He is currently at the higher end of this.  Likely secondary
   to pre-renal state in context of hypotension.  Lack of red cells in UA,
   minimal whites suggests that this is not active nephritis from
   Wegener's. Creatinine remains elevated > 3 today. K and phos trending
   up again with dwindling UOP.  Started on lasix gtt and diuril with some
   improvement in urine output although remains significantly volume
   overloaded.   Hyperkalemia improved with kayexalate and bowel movement
   overnight. Per discussion with family and Renal, will pursue CVVH
   - F/U renal recs
 plan for line placement and CVVH initiation today
   (may need blood products)
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - Follow electrolytes TID
   # Anemia/dropping hematocrit
 Patient had unexpected hematocrit drop
   from 28
 23.  Patient with bleeding from mouth (biting ET tube),
   coffee ground material from OG.  No other evidence of bleeding.  . Got
   2u PRBC, 2u FFP, 1 unit platelets and bumped appropriately.
   - Noncontrast CT torso to r/o RP bleed/other evidence of bleeding if
   evidence of re-bleeding.
   - monitor HCT Q 8 hours
   - Active T&S
   - Transfuse for HCT < 24, will transfuse 2 units now and cross-match
   additional 2 units
   # Coagulopathy: Started on heparin for LE DVT (no bolus) but
   supratherapeutic after starting.  Trending down this morning.
   - f/u on inhibitor
   - consider heme onc consult if abnormal or if persistent coagulopathy
   # DVT in RLE: Raises the possibility of PE as trigger for acute-onset
   SOB.
   - Off heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80; pt supratherapeutic ptt
   - F/U final TTE read
   - Monitor patient for signs of bleeding (oozing from skin tear on R arm
   where EKG lead was removed)
   - no plans for CTA, given borderline renal function, already on heparin
   gtt
   # Mental status: Abnormal neurological exam with unresponsive pupils,
   abnormal respiratory pattern.  DDX cerebral edema in setting of
   metabolic abnormalities, possible intracranial bleed given low
   platelets and heparin gtt.
   - CT head without any acute findings
   - continue sedation with propofol
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Somewhat early for HIT given
   started on heparin <24 hours ago.  Has history of thrombocytopenia on
   vancomycin. Received 1 unit overnight with good response.
   - trend TID
   - transfuse <50 (received 1 unit this AM)
   .
   # Possible Colitis: Unclear etiology.  Will treat empirically with

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. Reduced pressure requirement: The patient's need for phenylephrine, a vasopressor, has decreased.
2. Renal recovery trial: The patient's poor urine output (UOP) improved with the initiation of lasix and diuril.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation, which were controlled with amiodarone.
4. RUQ ultrasound: The ultrasound showed no appreciable abnormalities, including no gallstones, ascites, or splenomegaly.
5. Decreased PEEP: The patient's PEEP was decreased from 15 to 10 due to an ABG showing PaO2 of 63.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient had a very small bowel movement with guaiac positive stool, indicating possible bleeding. Lactulose was prescribed for constipation.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient had a low platelet count, which was treated with platelet transfusion.
8. DVT in right lower extremity: The patient has a confirmed DVT, which raises the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE).
9. Mental status changes: The patient had abnormal neurological exam with unresponsive pupils and an abnormal respiratory pattern.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y/o male with Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, likely
   PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient developed tachypnea and low oxygen
   saturation while in the emergency room. He required intubation
   following paralysis.  Despite this treatment he continues to be hypoxic
   with a respiatory acidosis on ABG.  This picture is likely an acute
   respiratory failure due to V/Q mismatch in the context of acute
   pneumonia in a substrate of a patient with emphysema and chronic lung
   damage from repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.
   Differential includes PE (CTA not performed) in context of autoimmune
   inflammation, and any of a number of lung infections as patient has
   long history of multiple infections.
   - Continue to adjust ventilatory settings to aim for O2 saturation
   88-92% given COPD history
   - Weaning FiO2 as tolerated (currently fi02 50%)
   - Trend ABGs
   - Continue albuterol/ipratroprium
   - send sputum for cx
   - COPD/Wegener
s flare treatment with Solumedrol  (125 mg IV Q8H
   mg IV on [**3-17**]) decrease to 50IV TID today
   - Chest PT when tolerated
   - Daily CXR
   - Antibiotics as below
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: Likely secondary to infection.  Does not seem to
   cardiogenic in etiology.  HCT appears to be stable post transfusion.
   Also likely superimposed adrenal insufficiency (especially in context
   of acute illness). Was on triple pressors; now down to one.  Weaning
   from pressors, vasopressin taken off [**2201-3-18**].
   - phenylephrine with goal MAP > 60
   - Trend CVP to evaluate better intravascular volume (mid-teens; most
   recent 16)
   - avoid fluid resuscitation as patient is markedly overloaded (though
   likely intravascularly deplete) with aim for consistent UOP
   - decrease solumedrol to 50 TID -> decrease by 10 every other day (per
   rheum recs)
   .
   # Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe infection consistent with
   likely infection.  Given his multiple past infectious the patient
   should be double-covered for pseudomonal infection, stenotrophomonas,
   gram positive infections.
   - Continue empiric Zosyn/Flagyl
   - check urine legionella
 negative
   - Off treatment dose bactrim IV given h/o stentotrophomonas
   - F/U ID recs
   .
   # Oliguric Renal failure:  Acute on chronic, with ranges in OMR from
   1.8 to 4.  He is currently at the higher end of this.  Likely secondary
   to pre-renal state in context of hypotension.  Lack of red cells in UA,
   minimal whites suggests that this is not active nephritis from
   Wegener's. Creatinine remains elevated > 3 today. K and phos trending
   up again with dwindling UOP.  Started on lasix gtt and diuril with some
   improvement in urine output although remains significantly volume
   overloaded.   Hyperkalemia improved with kayexcelate and bowel movement
   overnight.
   - F/U renal recs
 plan for line placement and CVVH today after
   discussing options with family
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - Follow electrolytes TID
   .
   # Anemia/dropping hematocrit
 Patient had unexpected hematocrit drop
   from 28
 23.  Patient with bleeding from mouth (biting ET tube),
   coffee ground material from OG.  No other evidence of bleeding.  . Got
   2u PRBC, 2u FFP, 1 unit platelets and bumped appropriately.
   - consider CT torso looking for RP bleed/other evidence of bleeding if
   evidence of re-bleeding.
   - monitor HCT Q 8 hours
   - Active T&S
   - Transfuse for HCT < 24
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Started on heparin for LE DVT (no bolus) but
   supratherapeutic after starting.  Trending down this morning.
   - f/u on inhibitor
   - consider heme onc consult if abnormal or if persistent coagulopathy
   # DVT in RLE: Raises the possibility of PE as trigger for acute-onset
   SOB.
   - Off heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80; pt supratherapeutic ptt
   - F/U final TTE read
   - Monitor patient for signs of bleeding (oozing from skin tear on R arm
   where EKG lead was removed)
   - no plans for CTA, given borderline renal function, already on heparin
   gtt
   .
   # Mental status: Abnormal neurological exam with unresponsive pupils,
   abnormal respiratory pattern.  DDX cerebral edema in setting of
   metabolic abnormalities, possible intracranial bleed given low
   platelets and heparin gtt.
   - CT head without any acute findings
   - continue sedation with propofol
   ..
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Somewhat early for HIT given
   started on heparin <24 hours ago.  Has history of thrombocytopenia on
   vancomycin. Received 1 unit overnight with good response.
   - trend TID
   - transfuse <50 (getting 1 unit this AM)
   .
   # Possible Colitis: Unclear etiology.  Will treat empirically with
   flagyl at this time.
   - Send C. diff once stool sample available
   - Consider repeat imaging once patient more stable.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation:  Overnight episodes of AFIB with RVR, this
   morning rate controlled.
   - Started on amiodarone gtt on [**3-18**], begin maintenance therapy as not
   currently a candidate for rate control
   .
   # Abnormal differential: Could be in context of sepsis, but marked
   abnormalitity raises possibility of underlying lymphoproliferative
   disease, especially given autoimmune diseases and use of azathioprine.
   Normal HCT and platelets decreases the possibility of malignancy.
   - Manual smear

   .
   # L2 fracture, avascular necrosis of hip: Both in context of steroid
   use, later may be also in context of hypoxia given global ischemia.
   Patient will have evaluation by orthopedics and spine once more stable.
   # Constipation: No BM since admission, possibly secondary to ileus.
   Patient has bowel sounds today.  BM on [**2201-3-18**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, respiratory failure, and likely pneumonia. He has been admitted to the ICU for severe hypoxia and hypotension. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 12 cmH2O and FiO2 of 40%. He is also receiving amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 96/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, hyperkalemia, and anemia.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, oliguric renal failure, anemia, coagulopathy, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), possible colitis, atrial fibrillation, abnormal differential, Wegener's disease, L2 fracture, avascular necrosis of the hip, constipation, androgen deficiency, and ileus.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including phenylephrine, amiodarone, furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and antibiotics. He is also receiving IV fluids and blood products as needed.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male who is admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation and acute respiratory failure. The patient has a history of Wegener's granulomatosis and is currently on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, as well as Lasix for oliguric acute renal failure. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/60 to 126/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 27 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. 

The patient has been receiving phenylephrine infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/min to maintain blood pressure and furosemide (Lasix) at 12 mg/hr for diuresis. 

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 400/167 U/L), elevated bilirubin levels (alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin: 284/1.5), low albumin level of 1.7 g/dL, elevated lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L, and elevated D-dimer level of 1482 ng/mL. 

The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's condition remains unchanged since admission. The medical team is considering the initiation of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) or intermittent hemodialysis (HD), but there are concerns about the patient's wishes regarding renal replacement therapy. 

The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status."
