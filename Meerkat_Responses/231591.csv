   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   We met with Mrs. [**Known lastname 8264**]
s two sons and the decision was made to try 1
   final course of antibiotics and then shift care to comfort measures. We
   will not pursue invasive testing such as a bronchoscopy. She will be
   transferred back to [**Hospital 328**] Rehab to complete the antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She has a history of pneumonia and lung mass. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/54 to 117/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,647 mL and output of 200 mL. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation, with crackles and bronchial breath sounds heard in the left mid-zone. She has no edema or cyanosis in her extremities. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated potassium levels, and slightly low hemoglobin. Imaging reveals right upper lobe mass, tracheal deviation to the left, bilateral effusions, and infiltrates in the right lower lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe. The patient's airway is at risk due to her inability to protect it. The assessment and plan include ruling out aspiration, infection, or cancer through bronchoscopy and biopsy. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she will be transferred to [Hospital 328] Rehab for comfort measures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple chronic medical problems. She presented with 3 weeks of pulmonary symptoms and hypoxia that did not improve. The patient has a known allergy to penicillins. She has been experiencing hypotension, which improved with hydration. Bilateral infiltrates were observed, but pneumonia is unlikely. The patient has an upper lobe mass, which could be metastatic lung cancer, thyroid cancer, or recurrent breast cancer. Due to her tenuous respiratory status, a bronchoscopic evaluation or biopsy cannot be performed. The patient and her family have chosen comfort care without any diagnostic or treatment interventions, as indicated by signing the DNR/DNI form. She is currently on comfort care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Despite the lack of improvement in the patient's pulmonary symptoms and presence of bilateral infiltrates, there is still a possibility of developing pneumonia due to her weakened immune system and compromised respiratory status.
2. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's tenuous O2 status and the presence of crackles bilaterally, there is a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if her condition deteriorates further.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient is already experiencing atrial fibrillation, and if left untreated or poorly managed, it could lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and advanced age"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple chronic medical problems presenting with 3 weeks of pulmonary symptoms and hypoxia without improvement. She has a penicillin allergy and her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 116 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 108/61 mmHg to 142/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Her physical examination shows well-nourished appearance, crackles bilaterally with bronchial breath sounds at the left base, and trace peripheral edema. Her laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 5.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count of 116 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 79 mg/dL. 

The patient's current plan includes treatment for presumed pneumonia given her penicillin allergy, upper lobe mass likely due to metastatic lung cancer or recurrent breast cancer, atrial fibrillation, and hypotension improved with hydration. The patient has chosen comfort care with DNR/DNI status and has signed the comfort care form. She will be transferred back to [**Hospital 147**] for antibiotics this afternoon.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with multiple chronic medical problems
   presenting with 3 weeks of pulmonary symptoms and hypoxia without
   improvement.
   1. Hypotension: clinical picture most consistent with dehydration.
   Patient also has a small body habitus and multiple valvular issues on
   echo from [**6-15**], including 3+ MR which likely reduce forward flow.
   Sepsis is less likely.  Her BP readings from the [**Hospital1 238**] are consistent
   indicate that her baseline BP is 100/60 recently. She is
   fluid-responsive.
   --Continue hydration overnight
   --Convert long acting nodal agents into short acting so we can keep
   rate control without dropping BP
   --Trend BP, family does not want invasive measures
   --Patient clinically stable, mentating and making urine with BP 90s/60s
   2. Bilateral infiltrates: patient with impressive consolidations on CT
   chest, without a clinical picture that matches degree of radiographic
   findings.  She has been on ~3 weeks of antibiotic therapy without
   significant improvement in clinical status.  Consider that this may
   represent BOOP/COP and may require steroids.
   --IP consult in am, NPO after midnight
   --Will not continue antibiotics as she has finished course detailed by
   [**Hospital1 238**]
   --Sputum sample
   --There may be a component of aspiration given her history of
   achalsia/GERD-stricture s/p dilation as she still has a wet cough.
   3. Upper lobe mass: positive PET concerning for malignancy, also with
   thyroid lesion.  Await final read of CT chest as lesion more
   consolidative than mass-like in appearance, currently. Discuss with
   family any further plans for diagnosis. Unlikely to be Tb, will not
   pursue r/o.  Expect that RUL lesion is separate from bibasilar
   consolidations.
   4. AF: currently with HR near 100, BP stable. HR near 100 in [**Hospital1 238**] notes
   as well. On metoprolol and diltiazem as outpatient.
   --Convert to shorter acting medications in setting of hypotension
   --Holding parameters
   --Not on coumadin due to imbalance/fall risk per [**Hospital1 238**] papers
   5. CHF: multiple valves are diseased. Currently pulmonary status mostly
   dictated by consolidations without significant component of fluid
   overload. Clinically dry, does not need diuresis.  On beta-blocker,
   asa/plavix as outpatient.
   6. AAA s/p repair: on asa and plavix as outpatient
   -hold in setting of possible need for biopsy
   7. Chronic pain: oxycontin, gabapentin, acetaminophen. Continue bowel
   regimen. Patient reports having stools.
   8. Osteoporosis: ca/vit D.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with multiple chronic medical problems
   presenting with 3 weeks of pulmonary symptoms and hypoxia without
   improvement.
   1. Hypotension: clinical picture most consistent with dehydration.
   Patient also has a small body habitus and multiple valvular issues on
   echo from [**6-15**], including 3+ MR which likely reduce forward flow.
   Sepsis is less likely.  Her BP readings from the [**Hospital1 238**] are consistent
   indicate that her baseline BP is 100/60 recently. She is
   fluid-responsive.
   --Continue hydration overnight
   --Convert long acting nodal agents into short acting so we can keep
   rate control without dropping BP
   --Trend BP, family does not want invasive measures
   --Patient clinically stable, mentating and making urine with BP 90s/60s
   2. Bilateral infiltrates: patient with impressive consolidations on CT
   chest, without a clinical picture that matches degree of radiographic
   findings.  She has been on ~3 weeks of antibiotic therapy without
   significant improvement in clinical status.  Consider that this may
   represent BOOP/COP and may require steroids.
   --IP consult in am, NPO after midnight
   --Will not continue antibiotics as she has finished course detailed by
   [**Hospital1 238**]
   --Sputum sample
   --There may be a component of aspiration given her history of
   achalsia/GERD-stricture s/p dilation as she still has a wet cough.
   3. Upper lobe mass: positive PET concerning for malignancy, also with
   thyroid lesion.  Await final read of CT chest as lesion more
   consolidative than mass-like in appearance, currently. Discuss with
   family any further plans for diagnosis. Unlikely to be Tb, will not
   pursue r/o.  Expect that RUL lesion is separate from bibasilar
   consolidations.
   4. AF: currently with HR near 100, BP stable. HR near 100 in [**Hospital1 238**] notes
   as well. On metoprolol and diltiazem as outpatient.
   --Convert to shorter acting medications in setting of hypotension
   --Holding parameters
   --Not on coumadin due to imbalance/fall risk per [**Hospital1 238**] papers
   5. CHF: multiple valves are diseased. Currently pulmonary status mostly
   dictated by consolidations without significant component of fluid
   overload. Clinically dry, does not need diuresis.  On beta-blocker,
   asa/plavix as outpatient.
   6. AAA s/p repair: on asa and plavix as outpatient
   -hold in setting of possible need for biopsy
   7. Chronic pain: oxycontin, gabapentin, acetaminophen. Continue bowel
   regimen. Patient reports having stools.
   8. Osteoporosis: ca/vit D.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple chronic medical problems presenting with 3 weeks of pulmonary symptoms and hypoxia without improvement. The patient has hypotension, which is likely due to dehydration and possibly reduced forward flow caused by valvular issues. Sepsis is less likely. The patient is fluid-responsive, and it is recommended to continue hydration overnight. The patient also has bilateral infiltrates with consolidations on CT chest, despite being on antibiotic therapy for 3 weeks. This may represent BOOP/COP and may require steroids. There is also an upper lobe mass positive on PET concerning for malignancy, along with a thyroid lesion. The patient is currently on metoprolol and diltiazem for atrial fibrillation, but these medications may need to be converted to shorter-acting ones due to hypotension. The patient's pulmonary status is mostly dictated by consolidations without significant fluid overload. She is clinically dry and does not need diuresis. 

The patient has multiple other medical conditions, including AAA s/p repair, chronic pain, osteoporosis, chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, and hyponatremia. The patient has signed a comfort care form and has a DNR/DNI status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of dehydration, further deterioration of the bilateral infiltrates and consolidations,"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with respiratory distress. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, erythromycin base, and macrolide antibiotics. She is currently in the ICU and has been given a DNR/DNI/DNH/CC code status. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemia and a larger PET positive lesion in the right upper lobe (RUL). There are bibasilar consolidations that have progressed despite antibiotic treatment. The differential diagnosis includes progressive cancer (lung vs thyroid vs breast), BOOP, atypical infection, or aspiration. The family has agreed to limit care and provide a brief course of antibiotics for a superimposed infection, without treatment for malignancy or BOOP. The patient will receive comfort care at Hospital 328 Rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary. If the patient's condition worsens, mechanical ventilation may be required.

2. Infection: Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient's bibasilar consolidations have progressed. There is a risk of developing a more severe infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis. Regular assessment of vital signs, white blood cell count, and other infection markers is crucial. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics based on culture results is essential.

3. Malignancy: The presence of a larger PET positive lesion in the R"
