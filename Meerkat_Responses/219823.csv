","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, sepsis without organ dysfunction, cirrhosis of the liver, and acute renal failure. 

The patient underwent large volume paracentesis and was started on tube feeds. Renal ultrasound was performed, which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. The patient is currently receiving octreotide, midodrine, albumin, and various other medications.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/52 mmHg to 109/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a central venous pressure of 13 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,458 mL, including 506 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 240 mL of oral intake, 20 mL of tube feeding, and 1,708 mL of intravenous fluids. Output includes 134 mL of urine and 5 mL of nasogastric aspirate. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose levels, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and abnormal liver function tests"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis who has been admitted to the MICU. He presents with hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, and sepsis secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is caused by MRSA. The patient also has a history of diuretic-refractory ascites, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, previous SBP, and hepatocellular carcinoma treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/52 mmHg to 60/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg, and bladder pressure is 20 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,458 mL, including 506 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 240 mL of oral intake, 20 mL of tube feeding, and 1,708 mL of intravenous fluids. The output includes 134 mL of urine, 5 mL of NG tube output, and 5 mL of stool. The total fluid balance is 2,324 mL with a positive balance of 501 mL.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.5 K/uL. The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is 8.3 g/dL, platelet count is 42 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level is 3.2 mg/dL, blood glucose level is 149 mg/dL, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are elevated. Other lab values indicate hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and an elevated bilirubin level.

The patient's assessment includes hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, sepsis without organ dysfunction, cirrhosis of the liver, and acute renal failure. The plan involves continuing treatment for HRS with midodrine, monitoring urine output, and following up with cultures of the peritoneum and blood.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's condition due to sepsis, further deterioration of renal function, development of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence, complications related to tube feeding, and potential infections due to the presence of a central venous line.

Please note that the above summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

   hypertension, splenomegaly, h/o SBP, and hepatocellular carcinoma
   status-post RFA [**3-20**] admitted to MICU with hyperglycemia, ARF and
   sepsis from SBP s/p PC today with 6000WBC
   .
   # Sepsis- source is SBP given results of paracentesis and + cx on [**4-11**]
   with MRSA, leukocytosis. Baseline SBP 90s.  Improving with antibiotic
   therapy, WBC trending down, BP
s stabilizing.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn to cover for MRSA and GNR in peritoneum
   -small volume para today, will resend cell count and culture to eval
   for decreasing cell count as marker of resolving infection, if cell
   count going up would change zosyn to meropenam.
   - albumin 50gm IV BID
   - follow up cultures peritoneum, blood
   .
   # Acute renal failure- b/l 1.5-1.7, most likely 2/2 HRS resulting from
   combination of large volume paracentesis and bacterial peritonitis.
   Despite tx for HRS creatinine continues to worsen with minimal urine
   output.   Renal ultrasound did not show any evidence of hydronephrosis
   or post obstructive cause for the renal failure.
   - continue octreotid/midodrine/albumin 50g IV BID
   -appreciate renal reccs -> will likely require dialysis in the next [**1-15**]
   days
   -given that bladder pressure now elevated to 25, will do ~2L
   paracentesis to relieve pressure [**2-15**] concern that ascites could now
   contribute to worsening renal failure.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia- difficult to control in setting acute infection, may
   be contribution of poor sq absorption.

","The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, previous spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatocellular carcinoma status-post radiofrequency ablation (RFA). He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with hyperglycemia, acute renal failure (ARF), and sepsis secondary to SBP. The source of sepsis is SBP, as indicated by the results of paracentesis and positive culture for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), along with leukocytosis. The patient's baseline SBP level was 90s and is improving with antibiotic therapy. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, sepsis without organ dysfunction, cirrhosis of the liver, and acute renal failure. 

The plan of care includes continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) to cover for MRSA and gram-negative bacteria in the peritoneum. A small volume paracentesis will be performed today, and cultures of the peritoneum and blood will be followed up. Albumin at a dose of 50gm IV BID will also be administered.

Acute renal failure is suspected to be caused by HRS resulting"

The assessment and plan include several medical complications that can arise. These include hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, sepsis without organ dysfunction, cirrhosis of the liver, acute renal failure, and others. 

The patient has been placed on multiple medications such as vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), midodrine, albumin, insulin gtt, and others to manage these conditions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, non-anion gap acidosis, cytopenia, and potential contrast nephropathy due to recent IV contrast administration. 

It is important to monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, laboratory values, and response to treatment closely to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 57-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis complicated
   by diuretic refractory ascites with q2wk paracentesis, portal
   hypertension, splenomegaly, h/o SBP, and hepatocellular carcinoma
   status-post RFA [**3-20**] admitted to MICU with hyperglycemia, ARF and
   sepsis from SBP s/p PC today with 6000WBC
   .
   # Sepsis/SBP
 Paracentesis on [**4-11**] with MRSA and significant
   leukocytosis.  Baseline SBP in the 90s and now stable for the most part
   with occational dips into the 70s.  Repeat paracentesis on [**4-17**] with 1+
   GPCs and improved leukocytosis.  Increased concern for persistent
   bacterial colonization esp given high vanco troughs.  Otherwise
   afebrile and asymptomatic.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn to cover for MRSA and GNR in peritoneum
   -> consider meropenem if decompensates
   - given daptomycin 400mg IV x1 last night for persistent GPCs -> will
   discuss need for continuance.
   -  f/u paracentesis gram stain/micro, as well as blood cultures
   - albumin 50gm IV BID
   - IVF boluses prn for low BP, monitor CVP with goal [**10-24**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure- b/l 1.5-1.7, today intervally increased.  Most
   likely 2/2 HRS resulting from combination of large volume paracentesis
   and bacterial peritonitis.   Despite tx for HRS creatinine continues to
   worsen with minimal urine output.   Renal ultrasound did not show any
   evidence of hydronephrosis or post obstructive cause for the renal
   failure.   Bladder pressure 25 s/p 2 liter paracentesis
   - continue octreotid/midodrine/albumin 50g IV BID
   - appreciate renal reccs
   - plan to initiate hemodialysis in near future.  Will have temporary HD
   line placed by IR today
   - FFP prior to line placement
   - Renal dose medications, cont phos binder, [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia- Has been difficult to control in setting acute
   infection, may be contribution of poor sq absorption.
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) **] recs
   - Restarted insuling gtt and cont while in MICU
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis- End stage, currently on transplant list
   - SBP on Zosyn/Vanco, given dose of Dapto
   - encephalopathy ppx - lactulose, rifaximin
   - esophageal varices ppx - holding nadolol
   - ascites treatment - holding spironolactone 100mg daily, furosemide
   40mg daily
   - nutritional supplementation w tube feeds -> restart after HD line
   .
   #Coagulopathy
 likely [**2-15**] ESLD and nutritional deficiency, though not
   correcting with vitamin k
   -5mg po vitamin K x 3 days given likely will need line for dialysis
   - FFP to be given prior to procedures
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds, monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Likely multifactorial due to ESLD, ARF,
   nutritional deficiency, phlebotomy
   - Cont to trend
   - Active T/S at all times
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Likely related to uremia due to ARF as well as
   lactic acidosis due to ESLD

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, complicated by diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, h/o SBP, and hepatocellular carcinoma. He was admitted to the MICU with hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, and sepsis from SBP. He underwent paracentesis on 4/11 with MRSA and significant leukocytosis. Repeat paracentesis on 4/17 with 1+ GPCs and improved leukocytosis. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating and he has had occasional dips into the 70s. He is currently on vancomycin and zosyn to cover for MRSA and GNR in the peritoneum. Daptomycin was given for persistent GPCs. The patient's renal function has worsened despite treatment for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). He is planned for temporary HD line placement by IR today and will initiate hemodialysis in the near future. His hyperglycemia has been difficult to control, likely due to poor absorption of oral medications. Insulin gtt has been restarted. The patient is on the transplant list for HCV cirrhosis. He also has encephalopathy ppx with lactulose and rifaximin, esophageal varices ppx with holding nadolol, ascites treatment with spiron"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, and altered mental status. The patient has undergone paracentesis, dialysis, and received multiple antibiotics. His vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive. He is receiving nutrition support and has been placed on NPO status for a procedure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate ongoing hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potentially result in organ damage.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's liver disease and renal dysfunction suggest the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome. This condition can progress to renal failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can increase the risk of infection and worsen overall outcomes.
4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's NPO status and altered nutritional status may contribute to malnutrition and weakened immune system, making him more susceptible to infections and delayed wound healing.
5. Sepsis: Although the patient has been treated with antibiotics, there is still a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis. Prompt identification and management of any new"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 57-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis complicated
   by diuretic refractory ascites with q2wk paracentesis, portal
   hypertension, splenomegaly, h/o SBP, and hepatocellular carcinoma
   status-post RFA [**3-20**] admitted to MICU with hyperglycemia, ARF and
   sepsis from SBP s/p PC today with 6000WBC
   .
   # Sepsis/Bacterial Peritonitis
 Paracentesis on [**4-11**] with MRSA and
   significant leukocytosis.  Baseline SBP in the 90s and now stable for
   the most part with occational dips into the 70s.  Repeat paracentesis
   on [**4-17**] with 1+ GPCs and improved leukocytosis.  Increased concern for
   persistent bacterial colonization esp given high vanco troughs.
   Otherwise afebrile and asymptomatic.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn to cover for MRSA and GNR in peritoneum
   -> consider meropenem if decompensates
   - given daptomycin 400mg IV x1 last night for persistent GPCs -> will
   discuss need for continuance.
   -  f/u paracentesis gram stain/micro, as well as blood cultures
   - albumin 50gm IV BID
   - IVF boluses prn for low BP, monitor CVP with goal [**10-24**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure- b/l 1.5-1.7, today intervally increased.  Most
   likely 2/2 HRS resulting from combination of large volume paracentesis
   and bacterial peritonitis.   Despite tx for HRS creatinine continues to
   worsen with minimal urine output.   Renal ultrasound did not show any
   evidence of hydronephrosis or post obstructive cause for the renal
   failure.   Bladder pressure 25 s/p 2 liter paracentesis
   - continue octreotid/midodrine/albumin 50g IV BID
   - appreciate renal reccs
   - plan to initiate hemodialysis in near future.  Will have temporary HD
   line placed by IR today
   - FFP prior to line placement
   - Renal dose medications, cont phos binder, [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia- Has been difficult to control in setting acute
   infection, may be contribution of poor sq absorption.
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) **] recs
   - Restarted insuling gtt and cont while in MICU
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis- End stage, currently on transplant list
   - SBP on Zosyn/Vanco, given dose of Dapto
   - encephalopathy ppx - lactulose, rifaximin
   - esophageal varices ppx - holding nadolol
   - ascites treatment - holding spironolactone 100mg daily, furosemide
   40mg daily
   - nutritional supplementation w tube feeds -> restart after HD line
   .
   #Coagulopathy
 likely [**2-15**] ESLD and nutritional deficiency, though not
   correcting with vitamin k
   -5mg po vitamin K x 3 days given likely will need line for dialysis
   - FFP to be given prior to procedures
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds, monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Likely multifactorial due to ESLD, ARF,
   nutritional deficiency, phlebotomy
   - Cont to trend
   - Active T/S at all times
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Likely related to uremia due to ARF as well as
   lactic acidosis due to ESLD

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, previous spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatocellular carcinoma.
- He was admitted to the MICU with hyperglycemia, acute renal failure (ARF), and sepsis from SBP.
- He underwent paracentesis on 4/11 and 4/17, with MRSA and significant leukocytosis found in the first paracentesis.
- He is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) to cover for MRSA and gram-negative rods in the peritoneum.
- Daptomycin was given for persistent Gram-positive cocci (GPCs).
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he requires IV fluid boluses as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.
- He is also receiving albumin 50gm IV BID, and his creatinine levels continue to worsen despite treatment for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
- The patient has been placed on the transplant list for HCV cirrhosis.
- His hyperglycemia has been difficult to control due to poor absorption of oral medications.
- He is currently on insulin gtt for glycemic control.
- Other concerns include coagulopathy, anemia/thrombocytopenia, and anion gap acidosis.
- The patient's disposition is currently in the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTENSION: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he requires IV fluid boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and hemodynamic stability is necessary.
2. HEPATORENAL SYNDROME: The patient's renal function is deteriorating despite treatment, indicating possible progression of HRS. Continuous monitoring of renal function and consideration of hemodialysis may be required.
3. HYPERGLYCEMIA: The patient's hyperglycemia is difficult to control, possibly due to poor absorption of oral medications. Insulin therapy is being continued for glycemic control.
4. ASCITES: The patient has diuretic refractory ascites, which may require additional interventions such as repeat paracentesis or surgical options like TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt).
5. SPONTANEOUS BACTERIAL PERITONITIS (SBP): The patient's recent history of SBP increases the risk of recurrent infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic coverage are essential.
6. COAGULOPATHY: The patient has a coagulopathy that could be due to ESLD and nutritional deficiency. Vitamin K supplementation and FFP (fresh frozen plasma) may be needed for procedures or before dialysis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, complicated by diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, h/o SBP, and hepatocellular carcinoma. He was admitted to the MICU with hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, and sepsis from SBP. The patient has been treated for sepsis/bacterial peritonitis, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, HCV cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and nutritional support. He has ongoing issues with anemia/thrombocytopenia and anion gap acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HEPATORENAL SYNDROME: The patient has acute renal failure that is likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) resulting from large volume paracentesis and bacterial peritonitis.
2. HYPERGLYCEMIA: The patient has difficulty controlling blood sugar levels, which may be due to the acute infection and poor absorption of nutrients.
3. ALTERATION IN NUTRITION: The patient requires nutritional support due to his chronic liver disease and recent hospitalization.
4. SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION: The patient had an episode of sepsis due to SBP, which has been treated appropriately.
5. CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER: The patient's liver disease is advanced and has led to complications"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The note indicates that the patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure (ARF), hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, cirrhosis of the liver, and other comorbidities.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). They are receiving mechanical ventilation support with a respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. The patient's general appearance is described as thin, with poor dentition and an NG tube in place.

Physical examination findings include diminished breath sounds, jaundice, muscle wasting, and absent peripheral pulses. The patient's neurological status is reported as attentive with asterixis.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose levels. The platelet count is within normal range. Liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated ALT/AST levels, while electrolytes are mostly within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver and other unspecified conditions. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, daptomycin, and Zosyn, but these have been discontinued. The patient is currently on intermittent hemodialysis (HD) and has a tunneled dialysis catheter in place.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include septic shock, worsening renal function, liver failure, hyperglycemia, malnutrition, and potential infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis and complications such as diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatocellular carcinoma. He was admitted to the MICU with hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, and sepsis from SBP. The patient has undergone multiple paracentesis procedures due to SBP and has shown improvement in leukocytosis. However, he continues to have persistent bacterial colonization, especially with high vancomycin trough levels. 

The patient is currently on vancomycin for SBP, and other antibiotics have been discontinued. Surveillance cultures and repeat paracentesis micro are recommended. Albumin is being given intravenously at a dose of 50gm BID. IV fluid boluses are given as needed for low blood pressure, and central venous pressure (CVP) is monitored with a goal of 10-24 mmHg. 

The patient also has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.5-1.7 in both kidneys. This is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) resulting from large volume paracentesis and bacterial peritonitis. Despite treatment for HRS, creatinine continues to worsen with minimal urine output. Renal ultrasound did not reveal any evidence of hydronephrosis or post-obstructive cause for the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis, complicated by diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatocellular carcinoma. He was admitted to the MICU with hyperglycemia, acute renal failure (ARF), and sepsis from SBP. The patient has undergone paracentesis, received intravenous antibiotics, and had a hemodialysis line placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating potential hypotension. This may be due to sepsis, ARF, or other factors.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's renal function has deteriorated despite treatment for HRS. It is important to monitor and manage this condition closely.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has difficulty controlling blood sugar levels, which may be attributed to acute infection and poor oral absorption.
4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient requires nutritional support due to his compromised liver function and current inability to absorb nutrients properly.
5. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient initially presented with sepsis secondary to SBP. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to prevent further complications.
6. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient has end-stage cirrhosis and is currently on the transplant list.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. He is currently admitted to the ICU for management of hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has been receiving various medications, including insulin for glycemic control, piperacillin/tazobactam, daptomycin, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin for infection prophylaxis. He has also undergone several procedures, such as paracentesis, blood transfusion, and dialysis catheter placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating potential hypotension. This can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and may require further investigation and treatment.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's history of cirrhosis and renal failure increases the risk of hepatorenal syndrome. This condition can result in worsening renal function and may require specific interventions, such as dialysis.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels remain elevated despite insulin therapy. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can increase the risk of infections and complications associated with poor glycemic control.
4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's nutrition appears to be compromised, which can further weaken the immune system and impede recovery. Nutritional"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and complications such as diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, h/o SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), and hepatocellular carcinoma. He was admitted to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) with hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, and sepsis from SBP.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and cirrhosis of the liver. He also has renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF), and is on the transplant list for HCV cirrhosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. HEPATORENAL SYNDROME: This condition is characterized by renal failure secondary to liver disease, specifically cirrhosis. It can occur due to various factors, including large-volume paracentesis and bacterial peritonitis.
2. HYPERGLYCEMIA: The patient's blood glucose levels have been difficult to control, especially during acute infection. This may be due to poor absorption of oral medications.
3. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: The patient has bilateral kidney dysfunction with a creatinine level of 1.5-1.7. This could be caused by hepatorenal syndrome or other factors"

","Summary:
Mr. [Known Lastname 31] is a 57-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis, complicated by diuretic refractory ascites with q2wk paracentesis, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatocellular carcinoma status-post radiofrequency ablation (RFA). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, and sepsis from SBP. The patient has undergone multiple paracentesis procedures, with MRSA and significant leukocytosis noted on [4-11]. Repeat paracentesis on [4-17] showed 1+ Gram-positive cells and improved leukocytosis. There is concern for persistent bacterial colonization, especially given high vancomycin trough levels. The patient is afebrile and asymptomatic, with surveillance micro-NGT, transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) unremarkable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating persistent hypotension. This may be due to fluid loss during paracentesis, sepsis, or other factors. Close monitoring and IV fluid boluses as needed are recommended.

2. HEPATORENAL SYNDROME: The patient has developed hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which is characterized by renal failure"
