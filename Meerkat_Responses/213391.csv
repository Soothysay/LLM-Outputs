   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo F with DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, p/w PNA, intubated in the ED
   .
   # Sepsis: Likely source is PNA given clinical history, leukocytosis
   with bandemia and CXR findings.  Other possiblities include urine or
   bowel.  Patient given 8L NS in ED, CVP 20, SVO2 92, on Levophed.
   Basically, has recieved Early Goal Directed therapy in ED.  Lactate
   6.7, then 2.4 on transfer.  Hct 38.  Then required 3 pressor support
   for MAP > 65.
   - Monitor CVP goal > 12
   - Trend HCT
   - Levophed, Phenylephrine, Vasopressin for MAP > 65
   - Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8
   - Follow-up blood / urine culture, daily blood cultures
   - Sputum culture: GPC on gram stain
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP / CVP monitoring
   - On bicarbonate gtt for profound acidemia
   - Continue Levo/Zosyn, will likely not need more Vanc given oliguria
   - Continue volume resuscitation with 2L D5 Bicarb
   - Consider Zygris
   - f/u urine legionella
   - f/u respiratory viral cx
   - f/u vanc level and re-dose accordingly
   .
   # Respiratory failure [**2-13**] PNA: Community acquired.  Did recently have
   PNA in FL in [**11-19**] and was hospitalized at that time as well.
   Spirometry suggests a restrictive underlying lung disease in [**2111**], does
   have h/o tobacco but no current use per review of OMR.  Blood cultures
   in ED and receieved Vanc / Levo / Flagyl.  Transfered on CMV.  Patient
   did receive PNA in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   - Vanc / Zosyn / Levo for HAP requiring ICU level of care
   - Sputum culture: GPC
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - VAP bundle
   - Consider Ipratroprium / Albuterol if poor ventilation given tobacco
   history
   - Esopagheal balloon for PEEP titration
   .
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With both lactic acidosis and ketones
   on UA.  No uremia or history of toxic ingestions.  Recieved substantial
   amount of NS in ED. Serum tox negative.  Now with  worsening lactic
   acidosis.
   - Sepsis treatment as above, trend lactic acid
   - Continue IVFs given oliguria
   - Insulin as above
   .
   # Leukopenia: WBC 3.3 with 50% PMNs, 29% bands.  Not neutropenic.
   Likely suppresssed [**2-13**] acute infection.
   - Trend, follow-up diff, ? developing neutropenia
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Decreased since prior but last in [**2110**].  Could be
   [**2-13**] suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease with
   decreased thrombopoetin.
   - Trend
   - follow DIC labs
   .
   # Mild transaminitis / Elevated INR: Likely [**2-13**] infection, but could be
   med effect, chronic liver disease or poor flow. Serum tox negative.
   - Trend
   .
   # DM: On insulin.  Unclear prior dosing.
   - put on insulin gtt
   - FS QID
   .
   # Anemia:  HCT downward trending
   - trend
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   # Oliguria: Urine output minimal
   - consider CVVH
   .
   # Hypertension: Septic on admission with hypotension requiring
   Levophed.
   - Hold Atenolol
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: h/o [**Doctor Last Name 3691**] disease s/p ablation.
   - Continue Levoxyl IV (1/2 dose po)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia / CAD: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 449**].  On Atorvastatin,
   Aspirin and Atenolol as outpatient.
   - Hold medications until condition improves
   .
   # Elevated CK: Noted previously, but patient also found down for
   unclear duration of time.  Cr stable, has received 8L NS in ED, which
   should be appropriate hydration of any element of rhabdo.
   - Monitor CK trend, Cr
   .
   # FEN: IVF judiciously, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI / VAP bundle / Pneumoboots
   .
   # Access:
   18 Gauge - [**2113-3-27**] 09:49 PM
   Multi Lumen - [**2113-3-27**] 10:29 PM
   Arterial Line - [**2113-3-28**] 12:30 AM
   # Code:  Full, ICU consent signed by daughter
   # Communication: Patient / Daughter, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5199**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5200**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5201**] (home),
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5202**] (cell)
   # Disposition: Pending improvement
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia (PNA) and required invasive ventilation, multi-lumen catheter placement, and arterial line insertion. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory failure due to community-acquired pneumonia. She is on mechanical ventilation with a CMV mode and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 65.

2. Anion gap metabolic acidosis with lactic acidosis and ketones on urinalysis. She has received a substantial amount of normal saline in the ED, and her lactic acid levels are worsening.

3. Leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.3 and 50% bands. This may be suppressed due to acute infection.

4. Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 93, which could be due to infection or chronic liver disease.

5. Mild transaminitis with elevated INR, likely due to infection or medication effect.

6. Diabetes mellitus, with unclear prior dosing of insulin.

7. Anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 11.6 g/dL, which is downward trending.

8. Oliguria with minimal urine output.

9. Hypertension, which is septic in nature.

10. Hypothyroidism"

   # Sepsis: Likely source is PNA given clinical history, leukocytosis
   with bandemia and CXR findings.  Other possiblities include urine or
   bowel.  Patient given 8L NS in ED, CVP 20, SVO2 92, on Levophed.
   Basically, has recieved Early Goal Directed therapy in ED.  Lactate
   6.7, then 2.4 on transfer.  Hct 38.  Then required 3 pressor support
   for MAP > 65.

   # Respiratory failure [**2-13**] PNA: Community acquired.  Did recently have
   PNA in FL in [**11-19**] and was hospitalized at that time as well.
   Spirometry suggests a restrictive underlying lung disease in [**2111**], does
   have h/o tobacco but no current use per review of OMR.  Blood cultures
   in ED and receieved Vanc / Levo / Flagyl.  Transfered on CMV.  Patient
   did receive PNA in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   - Zosyn / Levo for HAP requiring ICU level of care
   - Sputum culture: GPC
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - VAP bundle
   - Consider Ipratroprium / Albuterol if poor ventilation given tobacco
   history
   - Esopagheal balloon for PEEP titration

   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With both lactic acidosis and ketones
   on UA.  No uremia or history of toxic ingestions.  Recieved substantial
   amount of NS in ED. Serum tox negative.  Now with  worsening lactic
   acidosis.
   - Sepsis treatment as above, trend lactic acid
   - Judicious IVF given oliguria
   - Insulin as above

   # Leukopenia: WBC 3.3 with 50% PMNs, 29% bands.  Not neutrapenic.
   Likely suppresssed [**2-13**] acute infection.
   - Trend, follow-up diff, ? developing neutrapenia
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Decreased since prior but last in [**2110**].  Could be
   [**2-13**] suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease with
   decreased thrombopoetin.
   - Trend

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with pneumonia and required intubation in the emergency department (ED). The patient has been receiving aggressive treatment for sepsis and respiratory failure, including multiple pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, hydrocortisone, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis due to pneumonia. It is crucial to continue aggressive treatment and monitor for signs of deterioration.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a history of restrictive lung disease. Monitoring for any changes in oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
3. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an ongoing lactic acidosis, which may be related to sepsis and inadequate tissue perfusion. Close monitoring of lactic acid levels and acid-base status is required.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to sepsis-induced suppression or chronic liver disease. Regular monitoring of platelet counts is necessary.
5. Leukopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count with a predominance of band cells, indicating a possible response to acute infection. Monitoring for further changes"

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 39.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 116/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 71%. The patient is unresponsive and has been intubated with an endotracheal tube. 

The patient is on multiple pressors including phenylephrine, vasopressin, and norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,632 mL and output of 90 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,442 mL. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.13, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 50 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 65 mEq/L. The patient's arterial oxygen saturation (PaO2) is 65, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%. The patient's respiratory support consists of a controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode on the ventilator.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with severe bilateral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis, who is intubated for respiratory distress. She is hypotensive with a blood pressure in the 60s and has been given intravenous fluids (8L IVF) due to low blood pressure. The patient has difficulty ventilating, so paralytics have been added. The esophageal balloon was dropped and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased to 18. Severe metabolic acidosis is being treated with bicarbonate. Initially, the patient was given vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl, but now she is on vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl. She is also on the maximum dose of levofloxacin, neo, and vaso.

24-hour events include the initiation of invasive ventilation, multi-lumen placement, arterial line placement, nasal swab and sputum culture. Blood cultures were also taken, as well as an EKG.

Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

Last dose of antibiotics:
Piperacillin was given at 04:00 AM on 03/28/2113.

Infusions:
Midazolam (Versed) - 6 mg/hour
Phenylephrine - 2 mcg/Kg/min

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with severe bilateral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. She has been intubated for respiratory distress and is on maximum ventilatory support with FiO2 1.0 and PEEP 20, along with esophageal balloon monitoring and paralysis. The patient is also on four pressors, steroids, and has a central venous catheter. She has persistent metabolic acidosis and oliguric renal failure. The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated since admission, with multi-organ failure from Influenza B pneumonia, possibly complicated by a strep superinfection. The patient's family has been updated on her poor prognosis and wishes to continue aggressive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests a severe infection leading to sepsis. If not appropriately managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's severe respiratory distress, along with the need for high levels of oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), indicate the possibility of ARDS. ARDS can lead to significant lung injury and impaired gas exchange.
3. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's decreased urine output indicates oliguric renal failure. If left untreated, renal failure can progress to anuria and further compromise overall"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Since admission, pt has rapidly deteriorated
   with multi-organ failure from Influenza B PNA, probably strep
   superinfection (Sputum GS +GPC prs) /sepsis. Currently, she has
   marginal oxygenation& ventilation, BP, persistent acidosis, and is in
   oliguric renal failure on maximal ventilatory support (FiO2 1.0, PEEP
   20 with esoph. Balloon monitoring & paralysis), 4 pressors, steroids.
   Xigris started this afternoon due to severity of sepsis. This was
   discussed ahead of time with her family, esp. with recent history of
   unwitnessed fall and no head CT- they were made aware of the increased
   risk of bleeding on this medicine and still desired that we proceed.
   Family has been updated of her poor prognosis and outlook, still desire
   aggressive measures. Continuing antibiotics and pressor/ventilator
   support.
   Pt is critically ill.
   Total time spent on pt: 140 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with severe bilateral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. She is intubated for respiratory distress and has been given paralytics. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 39.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 73%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 2.1 K/uL, decreased platelet count of 93 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with sodium level of 134 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas analysis reveals severe metabolic acidosis.

The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. The plan includes administering bicarbonate, hydrocortisone, and considering Xigris for sepsis. Antibiotics vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin are also continued. Esophageal balloon monitoring is continued, and the patient will remain on paralysis and pressors.

The patient's condition is described as critically ill with multi-organ failure. The family has been updated on the poor prognosis and desire for aggressive measures. The patient requires ICU care, including"

   Striking and rapid interval progression of bilateral patchy opacity
   with near complete opacification
   of the left hemithorax consistent with airway disease
   ECHO [**3-28**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. There is mild global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular hypokinesis with elevated
   estimated filling pressure.
   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERGLYCEMIA

   bowel.  Patient given 8L NS in ED, CVP 20, SVO2 92, on Levophed.
   Basically, has recieved Early Goal Directed therapy in ED.  Lactate
   6.7, then 2.4 on transfer from ED.  Hct 38.  Then required 3 pressor
   support for MAP > 65.
   - Monitor CVP goal > 12, bolus as needed
   - Trend HCT, transfuse > 30 PRN
   - Dobutamine, continue for improved SvO2
   - Levophed, Phenylephrine, Vasopressin, Dobutamine for MAP > 65
   - Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8
   - Follow-up blood / urine culture, daily blood cultures
   - Sputum culture: GPC on gram stain, no growth
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP / CVP monitoring
   - On bicarbonate gtt for profound acidemia
   - Continue Levo/Zosyn/Vanc
   - Continue volume resuscitation with 2L D5 Bicarb

   # Respiratory failure [**2-13**] PNA: Community acquired.  Did recently have
   PNA in FL in [**11-19**] and was hospitalized at that time as well.
   Spirometry suggests a restrictive underlying lung disease in [**2111**], does
   have h/o tobacco but no current use per review of OMR.  Blood cultures
   in ED and receieved Vanc / Levo / Flagyl.  Transfered on CMV.  Patient
   did receive PNA in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   - Vanc / Zosyn / Levo for HAP requiring ICU level of care
   - Sputum culture: GPC
   - Follow-up blood cultures

   - Consider Ipratroprium / Albuterol if poor ventilation given tobacco
   history
   - Esopagheal balloon for PEEP titration
   .
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With both lactic acidosis and ketones
   on UA.  No uremia or history of toxic ingestions.  Recieved substantial
   amount of NS in ED. Serum tox negative.  Now with  worsening lactic
   acidosis.
   - Sepsis treatment as above, trend lactic acid
   - Continue IVFs given oliguria
   - Insulin as above
   .
   # Leukopenia: WBC 3.3 with 50% PMNs, 29% bands.  Not neutropenic.
   Likely suppresssed [**2-13**] acute infection.
   - Trend, follow-up diff, ? developing neutropenia
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Decreased since prior but last in [**2110**].  Could be
   [**2-13**] suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease with
   decreased thrombopoetin.
   - Trend
   - follow DIC labs
   .
   # Mild transaminitis / Elevated INR: Likely [**2-13**] infection, but could be
   med effect, chronic liver disease or poor flow. Serum tox negative.
   - Trend
   .
   # DM: On insulin.  Unclear prior dosing.
   - put on insulin gtt
   - FS QID
   .
   # Anemia:  HCT downward trending
   - trend
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   # Oliguria: Urine output minimal
   - consider CVVH
   .
   # Hypertension: Septic on admission with hypotension requiring
   Levophed.
   - Hold Atenolol
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: h/o [**Doctor Last Name 3691**] disease s/p ablation.
   - Continue Levoxyl IV (1/2 dose po)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia / CAD: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 449**].  On Atorvastatin,
   Aspirin and Atenolol as outpatient.
   - Hold medications until condition improves
   .
   # Elevated CK: Noted previously, but patient also found down for
   unclear duration of time.  Cr stable, has received 8L NS in ED, which
   should be appropriate hydration of any element of rhabdo.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous pneumonia. She is currently intubated in the ICU due to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, and hyperglycemia. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza B viral infection. She requires multiple pressor agents for maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is currently at 73%. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with bandemia, elevated lactate levels, and thrombocytopenia. Imaging shows bilateral patchy opacity with near complete opacification of the left hemithorax consistent with airway disease. The patient's medical history includes community-acquired pneumonia, restrictive underlying lung disease, and previous hospitalization for pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's current condition of ARDS indicates severe lung dysfunction, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis has led to multiple organ dysfunctions, including respiratory, renal, and hematological abnormalities.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires continuous support with multiple pressor agents, indicating a risk of persistent hypotension and potential cardiovascular instability.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a suspected case of sepsis, likely caused by influenza with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This is supported by the presence of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal blood culture results. Treatment includes antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam), supportive fluids, and vasopressors.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status indicates severe ARDS. This is characterized by the need for mechanical ventilation, low oxygen saturation, and diffuse bronchial breath sounds. Treatment includes lung-protective ventilation strategy, optimization of PEEP, and consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

3. Hypotension: The patient exhibits hypotension, which may be related to sepsis. Close monitoring of stroke volume variation (SVV) is recommended, and fluid boluses may be given if SVV >15%. Vasopressor support with dobutamine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine may also be required.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled hyperglycemia, necessitating an insulin infusion for glycemic control.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a risk for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female admitted with influenza B pneumonia and sepsis, resulting in multi-organ failure. She is critically ill with respiratory failure, shock, acidosis, renal failure, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. The patient remains on pressor support and ARDS net ventilation with increased PEEP. Sputum cultures have grown Staphylococcus aureus, indicating a superinfection. Leukopenia is improving, but the patient remains oliguric (producing little urine).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis due to influenza B pneumonia and a possible bacterial superinfection (Staphylococcus aureus). Appropriate antibiotics should be administered, and close monitoring of vital signs and organ functions is necessary.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure indicates the development of ARDS. Continued mechanical ventilation with careful adjustment of PEEP and FiO2 is crucial. Monitoring arterial blood gases (ABGs) every 2-4 hours is essential.

3. Shock: The patient's hypotension requires ongoing pressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion. Frequent assessment of blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output is necessary.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PTT and low platelet count suggest coagulopathy. Regular monitoring of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is pneumonia, sepsis, and influenza. The note highlights several significant events over the past day, including changes in the patient's condition and treatment interventions.

1. Dialysis catheter placement: A dialysis catheter was inserted on 03/29/2113 at 01:42 PM.
2. Arterial line management: The arterial line was initially stopped at 04:34 PM, then restarted at 04:44 PM.
3. Cardiovascular issues: The patient experienced ST segment elevations in the inferolateral leads, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. This was confirmed by a 12-lead ECG. The patient also developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and required levo-floxacin (Levo) to control heart rate. Afterward, the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 60s, so Levo was temporarily stopped and later restarted.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status deteriorated, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. The FiO2 was gradually weaned to 80%. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was initiated but had to be stopped due to the patient's worsening condition. The pH dropped to 7.22, prompting the order for a stat"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with complaints of pneumonia, sepsis, and influenza. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 380 mL, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 25 cmH2O. FiO2 is set at 70%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 87/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 78% on a ventilator.

The patient's medical history includes previous pneumonia in Florida in November 2011 and hospitalization at that time. She also had a recent episode of pneumonia in March 2018. The patient has a history of tobacco use but is currently not smoking. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with bandemia, elevated lactate levels, and thrombocytopenia. Blood cultures have been negative so far, but sputum culture revealed gram-positive cocci.

The patient's current condition is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute kidney injury, hyperglycemia, and thrombocytopenia. She is receiving multiple pressors for hemodynamic support, including norepinephrine,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old female admitted with influenza B and Staphylococcus pneumoniae infection, resulting in sepsis and multi-organ failure.
- She developed inferolateral ST elevation during atrial fibrillation.
- The patient is critically ill, requiring multiple interventions to maintain vital signs and organ function.
- She is on mechanical ventilation, receiving sedation and analgesia, and requires vasopressor support.
- There are concerns about acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), anemia, renal failure, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.
- The patient's blood cultures grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
- The plan includes weaning off mechanical ventilation, lightening sedation, continuing steroids, narrowing antibiotic coverage to Nafcillin, and continuing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis due to MSSA pneumonia and influenza B infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ function is essential.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a bacterial PNA and influenza, which indicates an infection. Sepsis is a serious condition that can lead to organ dysfunction and can be life-threatening.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2), high plateau pressure (39 cmH2O), and low respiratory system compliance (31.7 cmH2O/mL) suggest ARDS. ARDS is a severe lung condition that causes difficulty in breathing and can be associated with high mortality rates.

3. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's elevated troponin levels indicate possible cardiac injury, which could be due to a NSTEMI. This is further supported by the presence of atrial fibrillation, a common arrhythmia associated with cardiac stress.

4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia, which may be secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage or bleeding). Further investigation is needed to determine the source of blood loss.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure. This could be due to various factors such as hypoperfusion, sepsis, or direct kidney injury.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with pneumonia and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hyperglycemia, and mild transaminitis. She also has a history of NSTEMI and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 87/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 23 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2) is 98%, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 65 mmHg.

The patient has received various treatments, including vasopressor support, hydrocortisone, antibiotics, and CVVH. She has been monitored closely with frequent lab tests and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and transfusion of platelets if necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient's hem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and subsequently developed sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient also had an episode of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with new-onset atrial fibrillation. She has been receiving aggressive treatment including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs and ongoing respiratory and renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), medication effects, or chronic liver disease.
2. Anemia: The patient has a decreasing hemoglobin level, indicating acute anemia likely secondary to blood loss from hemorrhage or bleeding.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Insulin therapy has been initiated to manage her blood sugar levels.
4. ARDS: The patient developed ARDS, which is a serious complication of pneumonia characterized by severe respiratory distress and impaired oxygenation.
5. AKI: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, indicated"

s note above, and would add: 73 yo female admitted with influenza
   B and MSSA PNA and sepsis resulting in multiorgan failure with acute
   respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure. Over the past
   day, fiO2 requirement has decreased slightly, still requiring high
   levels of ventilatory support. Down to 2 pressors, but hemodynamics
   have been too tenuous to remove fluid through CVVHD, resulting in net
   ~30 liters positive since hospitalization.  Plans are to continue
   ventilator but attempt to decrease PEEP, use of pressors to maintain
   MAP>65, pan culture (has rising WBC this morning). Remains on nafcillin
   for MSSA.
   Conference was held with pt
s daughters, [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 5199**], this
   afternoon, during which we discussed pt
s status and overall outlook.
   Even if she survives her hospitalization for severe sepsis,
   realistically the recovery process will be protracted, involving at
   best  trach/PEG and months in recovery, with unclear recovery of renal
   function and mental status. They felt that this scenario was not one
   that the patient would have been interested in, yet among the daughters
   there were differences in how ready they felt to change the goals of
   care, including the issue of resuscitation in case of a cardiac arrest.
   Will continue to support the family as they come to grips with her
   critically ill situation.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 85 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female admitted with influenza B and MSSA pneumonia, resulting in multiorgan failure with acute respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition remains critical, requiring high levels of ventilatory support and pressors to maintain blood pressure. Despite a slight decrease in FiO2 requirement, the patient still requires significant support. Fluid balance has been a challenge, with a net positive of approximately 30 liters since hospitalization. The plan is to continue ventilator support but attempt to decrease PEEP and monitor for any changes in white blood cell count. The patient remains on nafcillin for MSSA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with ongoing inflammation and infection. There is a risk of further deterioration in organ function and potential progression to septic shock.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS, which can lead to progressive respiratory failure and difficulty in oxygenation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of chronic renal impairment or the need for long-term dialysis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which can lead to further complications such as infections or poor wound healing.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. There is a mention of influenza and MSSA PNA, pancx, CXR, and albumin if SVV >15%. This indicates that the patient may have an infection causing sepsis, which needs to be managed promptly.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is diagnosed with ARDS, which is characterized by acute lung injury. The plan includes decreasing PEEP to 22, checking ABGs q6h, and restarting sedation at a lower level.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to blood loss and hemorrhage. This requires careful monitoring of kidney function and consideration for dialysis.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, indicating thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Anemia: The patient is also anemic, likely secondary to blood loss. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and possible transfusion may be necessary.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels. Glycemic control needs to be maintained through insulin therapy.

7. NSTEMI: Although the patient's cardiac enzyme trending down suggests improvement, ongoing monitoring for any cardiac complications"
