","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who is experiencing increased shortness of breath, pain, and worsening pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient has been taken off anticoagulation due to a malignant hemorrhagic right pleural effusion and concurrent chemotherapy with sorafenib. However, the oncology fellow mentioned that the patient has been off chemotherapy for three weeks. Due to the increased clot burden, it was decided to start heparin without a bolus. The patient has a pleurex catheter in place in case of hemorrhagic effusion. The patient is also being treated for pneumonia, hyponatremia, and metastatic HCC. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms and imaging findings indicate worsening PEs. This is a potential life-threatening complication that requires immediate attention and treatment.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has subjective fever, normal WBC count, but CXR findings of a left upper lobe (LUL) or possibly post-obstructive pneumonia. This could lead to further respiratory distress and complications.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which may be secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This can cause neurological symptoms and requires careful management.
4. Metastatic HCC: The patient's cancer has metast"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is increased shortness of breath (SOB) and pain. 

The patient is currently on heparin sodium infusion for pulmonary embolism (PE), which has been stable overnight. There are no signs of bleeding or worsening hemorrhagic pleural effusion. The patient will continue with home oxygen therapy, heparin sodium infusion, active treatment and counseling, two peripheral intravenous lines, and pain control with hydromorphone (Dilaudid).

The patient also has pneumonia in the left upper lobe, which is likely post-obstructive due to known metastatic disease. Antibiotic coverage has been initiated with vancomycin and levofloxacin, and follow-up sputum culture and blood cultures are planned. Nebulizer treatment with oxygen will be given as needed.

The patient has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 129 today from 128 following normal saline. This is likely secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The patient's intake and output are being monitored, and gentle intravenous fluid replacement with normal saline will be continued.

The patient has metastatic HCC and known metastases to the lung and abdomen. He recently completed cycle 4 of chemotherapy and is attempting the full regimen. A follow"

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 78 bpm with a range of 68-100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/59 mmHg to 120/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute with a range of 14-26 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received infusions of heparin sodium and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). They have been given several medications including vancomycin. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's flow sheet data shows that their maximum temperature recorded over the past 24 hours was 35.7°C (96.2°F), and the current temperature is 35.6°C (96°F). The patient's blood pressure readings have been within the normal range. Their respiratory rate and oxygen saturation levels are stable. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 413 mL and output of 280 mL through the total input of 504 mL and total output of 280 mL.

The patient's lab results indicate a blood glucose level of 105 mg/d"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 30-year-old male with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient's family members were informed about his critical condition.
- The patient's code status was changed to comfort measures only (CMO) due to poor prognosis and increasing pain.
- Palliative care was consulted, and pain medications were adjusted.
- The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating possible SIADH from lung metastasis.
- Fluid restriction is recommended, and IV fluids were discontinued.
- The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and Ativan for nausea.
- The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.
- Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the right base and no acute distress.
- Neurological examination shows the patient is alert, oriented, and follows simple commands.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and low hemoglobin levels.
- The patient's condition is complicated by hyponatremia, malnutrition, chronic pain, and acute PE.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: Low sodium levels can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and coma. It should be closely monitored and managed with fluid restriction and possibly hypertonic saline.
2. Malnutrition: The patient may be at risk for further nutritional deficiencies, which can impair wound healing, immune function, and overall recovery.
3. Chronic Pain"

   will d/c IVF
   -Sent Urine lytes for ? SIADH with hyponatremia
   -continuing Heparin gtt for now.
   -Took CXR at 8pm given 2pt Hct drop during day- looks unchanged. Pt sat
   99% on RA and no evidence of bleed currently.
   -On Zofran and Ativan prn for nausea
   -Pt continues to c/o pain now abd pain on Dilaudid PCA and Toradol prn
   -Pt fluid challenged with 1L NS to which Na went from 131-127. Likely
   has SIADH from lung mets. Pt not taking much PO so no need to fluid
   restrict at this time but should refrain from using additional IVF.

   30 man with metastatic HCC now with increased SOB, pain found to have
   worsening PE's.

   # Pulmonary Embolism: Hemodynamically stable overnight. O2 saturation
   stable. Continued on Heparin gtt without signs of bleeding or worsening
   of hemorrhagic pleural effusion.
   - Cont home O2 dose
   - Cont Heparin gtt
   - active T+C
   - 2 PIVs
   - Cont pain control with dilaudid.
   .
   # Pneumonia: Afebrile without leukocytosis overnight.  CXR findings of
   a LUL/?post-obstructive pneumonia.
   - HAP coverage with Vanc / Levo (Currently not double covering for Gram
   Negatives)
   - F/U sputum cx.
   - F/U bcx
   - Nebs/O2 prn.
   # Hyponatremia: 129 today from 128 following NS.  Likely secondary to
   SIADH.  Although pt with decreased PO, question tea and toast diet.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - Gentle IVF with NS

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 30-year-old male with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient's family members were informed about his condition and the seriousness of his illness.
- The patient has been started on palliative care and pain management with Dilaudid PCA and titrated up.
- Fluid restriction is recommended due to suspected SIADH, but the patient is not taking much by mouth.
- Heparin infusion has been continued for PE without signs of bleeding or worsening of hemorrhagic pleural effusion.
- Antibiotics have been prescribed for suspected pneumonia, and further investigations are planned.
- The patient's hyponatremia is likely secondary to SIADH, and gentle IV fluids with NS are advised.
- The patient has metastasis to the lung and abdomen and is undergoing chemotherapy.
- Pain control and follow-up with oncology are prioritized.
- ICU care includes regular diet, glycemic control with insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a suspected pneumonia, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent its progression and potential complications.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient already has a confirmed PE, and there is a risk of further embolic events. Close monitoring and anticoagulation therapy are essential to prevent complications.
