   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 73 yo male with NHL on Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**], ESRD
   on HD, here with fever, hypotension, and new LLL infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for pneumosepsis.
   .
   1. Pneumonia, Sepsis, Hypotension, Fever:  Chest CT with clear evidence
   of new LLL pneumonia.  RLL pneumonia appears improved compared with
   prior.  .  Most likely source of infection in patient is pneumonia
   given new LLL infiltrate. However, possibilty of other etiologies as
   well.  Patient denies viral symptoms.  He has both HD line and
   port-a-cath which could be sources of infection.  No dysuria, diarrhea,
   chest pain, abdominal pain, or any other localizing symptoms.  Patient
   has leukopenia rather than leukocytosis and no left shift, but this may
   be secondary to chemotherapy.  Immunosuppression secondary to
   chemotherapy raises the possibility of fungal infections or other
   uncommon infections.  Recurrent PNAs over the last month is suggestive
   of aspiration, though patient reportedly had dysphagia level 5 (mild
   dysphagia) on last admission.  Hypovolemia from over-diuresis at
   dialysis also a possibility.
   - sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - check glucan, galactomanna
   - consider chest CT to further elucidate pulmonary findings
   - vanco/zosyn/azithro to cover CAP
    Pneumonia.  Patient has had multpile recent admissions for pneumonias.
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patienthas BP's ranging from 50s to 120s.  However,
   given fever, there is concern for sepsis.  After developing flash
   pulmonary edema, will hold off on further fluids.  He appears to have
   gotten 3.5 L total in ED and in MICU.  Patient mentating well in spite
   of low BPs, however, this BP appears lower than outpatient readings of
   100s-110s systolic.
   - levophed to maintain MAPS>65
   - evaluate for infectious etiology with blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - consider unusual infectious etiologies such as fungal source given
   immunosupression secondary to chemotherapy
   - hold off on further fluid boluses for now
   - hold carvedilol, spironolactone, lisinopril
   .
   3.  Respiratory distress.  After arrival to MICU, after getting 3.5 L
   of IVF, patient developed acute respiratory distress, hypertension,
   tachycardia, diffuse wheezing, and blood-tinged sputum.  History was
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema, and responded with lasix 40IV,
   morphine 1 mg, lopressor 5 mg IV.  Unable to give nitrate due to
   hypotension.  Lung exam, respiratory distress, and O2 requirements
   improved with these interventions.  In addition, concern for PNA, so
   getting vanco/azithro/zosyn.
   - hold off on fluid bolus
   - wean O2 as possible
   - vanco/zosyn/azithro for PNA
   .
   4.  Syncope.  Syncope at dialysis likely secondary to cerbral
   hypoperfusion in setting of hypotension.  EKG has no ischemic changes.
   - ROMI
   - s/p IVFs, now on pressors to maintain MAPS > 65
   .
   5. CKD.  ESRD, on HD. Concern for fluid overload after getting 3.5 L of
   fluid, but no urgent HD needs.
   - continue nephrocaps, ca acetate
   - notify renal
   - renal diet
   .
   6.  Type 2 DM.
   - hold glipizide
   - HISS
   .
   7.  NHL.  S/p Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**]) which is an alkylating
   [**Doctor Last Name **].  It causes pancytopenia with [**Last Name (un) 6472**] at 3 weeks ([**2150-4-15**]).  Also
   can cause hypotension in 6% of patients.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) who has been on chemotherapy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and presents with fever, hypotension, and new left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. The patient has a recent history of multiple admissions for pneumonias and is immunosuppressed due to chemotherapy. The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a new LLL infiltrate on chest X-ray, which is concerning for pneumosepsis. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). There is also a possibility of fungal infections or other uncommon infections due to immunosuppression.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fever, and leukopenia raise concerns for sepsis, possibly secondary to pneumonia. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been obtained to identify the infectious etiology. Evaluation for unusual infectious etiologies, such as fungal sources, is also recommended considering the patient's immunosuppressed state.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are ranging from 50s to 120s, and there is concern for sepsis-related hypotension. Levophed has been started to maintain mean"

   which raises the concern for bacterial or fungal infection.
   2. Bronchovascular opacity and consolidation in the right lower lobe
   shows some interval improvement consistent with resolving right lower
   lobe pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 73 yo male with NHL on Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**], ESRD
   on HD, here with fever, hypotension, and new LLL infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for pneumosepsis.
   .
   1. Pneumonia, Sepsis, Hypotension, Fever:  Chest CT with clear evidence
   of new LLL pneumonia.  RLL pneumonia appears improved compared to
   prior, though given length of course, concerning for potential atypical
   process or fungal infection.  Low IgG likely related to therapy for NHL
   and may predispose patient to pneumonia.
   - Cont. Vanc & zosyn (D1 [**4-6**]), azithromycin stopped
   - Blood culture through HD catheter today
   - obtain induced sputum
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - f/u glucan, galactomannan (drawn 1 hr after 1^st dose of zosyn)
   - consider bronchoscopy if patient does not improve on vanc & zosyn
   - cont. levophed for BP support & wean as tolerated
   - hold carvedilol, spironolactone, lisinopril
   .
   2.  Respiratory distress:  Resolved.  After arrival to MICU, after
   getting 3.5 L of IVF, patient developed acute respiratory distress,
   hypertension, tachycardia, diffuse wheezing, and blood-tinged sputum.
   History was consistent with flash pulmonary edema, and responded with
   lasix 40IV, morphine 1 mg, lopressor 5 mg IV.  Unable to give nitrate
   due to hypotension.  Lung exam, respiratory distress, and O2
   requirements improved with these interventions.  In addition, concern
   for PNA, so getting vanco/azithro/zosyn.
   - hold off on fluid bolus
   - wean O2 as possible
   - vanco/zosyn for PNA

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He is currently admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, sepsis, hypotension, and fever. The patient's medical complications include respiratory distress, syncope, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a new left lower lobe pneumonia, which raises concerns for pneumosepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient is febrile and hypotensive, indicating a possible systemic infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating poor perfusion.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient had acute respiratory distress with wheezing and blood-tinged sputum, which resolved after receiving IV fluids, morphine, and lopressor.
5. Syncope: The patient experienced syncope during dialysis, likely due to cerebral hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension from pneumonia.
6. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient has ESRD and is on HD. Nephrology follow-up is recommended.
7. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia related to therapy for NHL.
8. Type 2 DM"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 73 yo male with NHL on Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**], ESRD
   on HD, here with fever, hypotension, and new LLL infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for pneumosepsis.
   .
   1. Fever.  Most likely source of infection in patient is pneumonia
   given new LLL infiltrate. However, possibilty of other etiologies as
   well.  Patient denies viral symptoms.  He has both HD line and
   port-a-cath which could be sources of infection.  No dysuria, diarrhea,
   chest pain, abdominal pain, or any other localizing symptoms.  Patient
   has leukopenia rather than leukocytosis and no left shift, but this may
   be secondary to chemotherapy.  Immunosuppression secondary to
   chemotherapy raises the possibility of fungal infections or other
   uncommon infections.  Recurrent PNAs over the last month is suggestive
   of aspiration, though patient reportedly had dysphagia level 5 (mild
   dysphagia) on last admission.  Hypovolemia from over-diuresis at
   dialysis also a possibility.
   - sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - check glucan, galactomanna
   - consider chest CT to further elucidate pulmonary findings
   - vanco/zosyn/azithro to cover CAP
    Pneumonia.  Patient has had multpile recent admissions for pneumonias.
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patienthas BP's ranging from 50s to 120s.  However,
   given fever, there is concern for sepsis.  After developing flash
   pulmonary edema, will hold off on further fluids.  He appears to have
   gotten 3.5 L total in ED and in MICU.  Patient mentating well in spite
   of low BPs, however, this BP appears lower than outpatient readings of
   100s-110s systolic.
   - levophed to maintain MAPS>65
   - evaluate for infectious etiology with blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - consider unusual infectious etiologies such as fungal source given
   immunosupression secondary to chemotherapy
   - hold off on further fluid boluses for now
   - hold carvedilol, spironolactone, lisinopril
   .
   3.  Respiratory distress.  After arrival to MICU, after getting 3.5 L
   of IVF, patient developed acute respiratory distress, hypertension,
   tachycardia, diffuse wheezing, and blood-tinged sputum.  History was
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema, and responded with lasix 40IV,
   morphine 1 mg, lopressor 5 mg IV.  Unable to give nitrate due to
   hypotension.  Lung exam, respiratory distress, and O2 requirements
   improved with these interventions.  In addition, concern for PNA, so
   getting vanco/azithro/zosyn.
   - hold off on fluid bolus
   - wean O2 as possible
   - vanco/zosyn/azithro for PNA
   .
   4.  Syncope.  Syncope at dialysis likely secondary to cerbral
   hypoperfusion in setting of hypotension.  EKG has no ischemic changes.
   - ROMI
   - s/p IVFs, now on pressors to maintain MAPS > 65
   .
   5. CKD.  ESRD, on HD. Concern for fluid overload after getting 3.5 L of
   fluid, but no urgent HD needs.
   - continue nephrocaps, ca acetate
   - notify renal
   - renal diet
   .
   6.  Type 2 DM.
   - hold glipizide
   - HISS
   .
   7.  NHL.  S/p Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**]) which is an alkylating
   [**Doctor Last Name **].  It causes pancytopenia with [**Last Name (un) 6472**] at 3 weeks ([**2150-4-15**]).  Also
   can cause hypotension in 6% of patients.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with fever, hypotension, and new left lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray, concerning for pneumosepsis. The patient has leukopenia and no localizing symptoms. Immunosuppression secondary to chemotherapy raises the possibility of fungal infections or other uncommon infections. The patient's vital signs are unstable with fluctuating blood pressures, and he developed acute respiratory distress after receiving IV fluids, consistent with flash pulmonary edema. He is currently on pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a new left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which could be bacterial or fungal in origin. Given his immunosuppressed state, there is a higher risk for atypical pathogens or opportunistic infections.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension suggest a possible septic state. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered to identify the causative organism.
3. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient developed acute respiratory distress and hypertension after receiving IV fluids, which responded to diuresis and morphine. This may be related to his underlying cardiac condition.

   73 yo male with ESRD and found to have signficiant pneumonia in LLL and
   likely this in combination with persistent and significant aortic
   stenosis may explain the findings of signficiant hypotension requiring

   NHL and immune compromised state at baseline.
   1)Sepsis--likely pulmonary source and new LLL opacity likely represents
   significan evidence of new bacteial pneumonia.

   -Continue to Rx for pulmonary source
   2)PNEUMONIA, OTHER-Is concerning for dense and new infiltrate in
   patient with modest immune compromise.  He has had some improvement in
   pressor requirement.  This is a new infiltrate but he has had transient
   LL opacities and compromise.  Is dense and with modest air
   bronchograms.
   -Will check total IgG level

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and immune compromised state. He was admitted to the ICU for sepsis, likely of pulmonary origin, and significant pneumonia in the left lower lobe (LLL). The patient requires pressor support and antibiotic therapy. He has been febrile and shows signs of hypotension. Laboratory results indicate leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, with elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and C-reactive protein. Imaging reveals evidence of LLL opacity/infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's septic state may lead to further organ dysfunction and potential complications such as septic shock, multi-organ failure, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia, particularly involving the LLL, could progress and cause respiratory distress, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or even lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. ESRD: The patient's underlying end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may exacerbate fluid and electrolyte imbalances, requiring careful management of renal replacement therapy and close monitoring of fluid status and electrolyte levels.
4. NHL: The patient's history of non-Hodgkin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who is currently on dialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient presented with fever, hypotension, and a new left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray, which is concerning for pneumonia. The patient's low immunoglobulin G (IgG) level may increase the risk of infection due to his ongoing treatment for NHL.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate ranging from 91-140 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/64-121/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at both lung bases, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs or rubs.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.1 thousand/mm3, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.6 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 62 mg/dL, creatinine of 4.7 mg/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 177 IU/L.

He was admitted to the ICU with fever, hypotension, and a new left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray, concerning for pneumonia. He also has anemia likely related to NHL therapy and low immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but remains febrile. His blood cultures are pending, and he has an inadequate induced sputum sample. The patient is on pressors for blood pressure support and is being weaned off levophed as tolerated. His respiratory distress has resolved, but he is still on supplemental oxygen. His syncope during dialysis is likely due to cerebral hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension from pneumonia. The patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESRD are being managed by nephrology, and his type 2 diabetes mellitus is being managed with insulin sliding scale. His NHL is being treated with Bendemustine, which can cause pancytopenia and hypotension. The patient's anemia is likely related to NHL therapy. His electrolytes are replete, and he is on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. The patient is on full code status and is currently receiving ICU care."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia. The patient has a history of malignancy and is currently undergoing dialysis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 104/64 mmHg to 121/83 mmHg, heart rate between 91-130 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,122 mL since 12 AM, with outputs totaling 490 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate low levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. Blood cultures were drawn due to concerns about a potential infection. The patient has been receiving treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), metoprolol, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include epo, levophed, and Neo-synephrine.

The patient's recent events include becoming tachycardic during hemodialysis, which was initially treated with metoprolol and later with levophed. The patient also experienced a spike in fever and repeated blood cultures were taken. The patient's induced sputum was not done earlier in the day.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of malignancy, anemia, and dialysis dependence. He presents with fever, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently in the ICU. He requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His vital signs are unstable, with persistent tachycardia and hypotension. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated lactate levels, and signs of renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels suggest a possible septic state, which can progress to sepsis and septic shock if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's renal dysfunction and respiratory failure indicate the potential for multi-organ dysfunction. The impaired kidney function may further complicate the management of his condition.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's need for mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent and treat this complication.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, particularly in critically ill patients. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to prevent DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 73 yo male with NHL on Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**], ESRD
   on HD, here with fever, hypotension, and new LLL infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for pneumosepsis.
   .
   1. Pneumonia, Sepsis, Hypotension, Fever:  Chest CT with clear evidence
   of new LLL pneumonia.  RLL pneumonia appears improved compared to
   prior, though given length of course, concerning for potential atypical
   process or fungal infection.  Low IgG likely related to therapy for NHL
   and may predispose patient to pneumonia. Awaiting culture data, sputum
   cx inadequate. Now neutropenic.
   - Cont. Vanc & zosyn (D1 [**4-6**]), azithromycin stopped
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - f/u glucan pending, galactomannan neg (drawn 1 hr after 1^st dose of
   zosyn)
   - consider bronchoscopy if patient does not improve on vanc & zosyn
   - cont. levophed for BP support & wean as tolerated
   - hold carvedilol, spironolactone, lisinopril
   .
   2.  Respiratory distress:  Resolved.  After arrival to MICU, after
   getting 3.5 L of IVF, patient developed acute respiratory distress,
   hypertension, tachycardia, diffuse wheezing, and blood-tinged sputum.
   History was consistent with flash pulmonary edema, and responded with
   lasix 40IV, morphine 1 mg, lopressor 5 mg IV.  Lung exam, respiratory
   distress, and O2 requirements improved with these interventions.  CT
   chest showed LLL consolidation c/w PNA, so getting vanco/zosyn. Appears
   to be typical organism, so Azithro d/c
   - wean O2 as possible
 now on 2L NC
   - vanco/zosyn for PNA
   .
   3.  Syncope.  Syncope at dialysis likely secondary to cerbral
   hypoperfusion in setting of hypotension from pneumonia.  EKG has no
   ischemic changes. Ruled out for AMI. Now on pressors to maintain MAPS >
   65. Tolerating OOB to chair w/o symptoms.
   .
   4. CKD.  ESRD, on HD. Nephrology following, their assistance
   appreciated.  [**Month (only) 51**] need to titrate up levophed during HD.
   - continue nephrocaps, Ca acetate
   - renal diet

   5.  Type 2 DM.  On ISS
   - hold glipizide
   .
   6.  NHL.  S/p Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**]) which is an alkylating
   [**Doctor Last Name **].  It causes pancytopenia with [**Last Name (un) 6472**] at 3 weeks ([**2150-4-15**]).  Also

The patient is a 73-year-old male with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) on chemotherapy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented with fever, hypotension, and new left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray, concerning for pneumosepsis. He also had respiratory distress, hypertension, tachycardia, diffuse wheezing, and blood-tinged sputum. The patient's past medical history includes anemia likely related to therapy for NHL and chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, hypotension, and new LLL infiltrate on chest X-ray, are concerning for pneumonia. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
2. Sepsis: Given the presence of fever, hypotension, and pneumonia, the patient is at risk for sepsis. Close monitoring and management are necessary.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient previously experienced respiratory distress, hypertension, tachycardia, diffuse wheezing, and blood-tinged sputum. This may indicate flash pulmonary edema, which has responded to treatment with lasix, morphine, and lopressor.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) on active chemotherapy. He is currently being treated for possible catheter-related or pulmonary source sepsis, with ongoing antibiotic therapy.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Chronic renal failure: The patient requires dialysis, and there have been issues with significant loss of consciousness (LOC) and concern for fluid shift-related hypotension.

2. Possible fungal source: The left lower lobe (LLL) opacity has persisted across time, which may represent a fungal source. However, alternative testing has been negative to date.

3. Atypical mycobacteria or nocaria: These are possible causes for the LLL opacity, and the approach to diagnosis will need to be considered if all cultures are negative.

4. Evolution to neutropenia: The patient's NHL treatment may lead to neutropenia, which is a concern.

5. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension, which may be related to fluid shifts or other factors.

6. Pneumonia: The patient has a new/acute left LLL infiltrate, suggesting pneumonia. Antibiotics have been changed to cover MRSA.

7. Dialysis: The patient requires hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow, preferably in an inpatient setting due to the possibility of recurrent LOC.

8. Lines and catheters: The patient has multiple"

   This is a 73 yo male with NHL on Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**], ESRD
   on HD, here with fever, hypotension, and new LLL infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for pneumosepsis.
   .
   1. Pneumonia, Sepsis, Hypotension, Fever:  Improving. Chest CT with
   clear evidence of new LLL pneumonia.  RLL pneumonia appears improved
   compared to prior, though given length of course, concerning for
   potential atypical process or fungal infection.  Low IgG likely related
   to therapy for NHL and may predispose patient to pneumonia. Awaiting
   culture data, sputum cx inadequate. Now with ANC of <500. Afebrile x
   24hrs. Off Levophed x24hrs, including during dialysis.
   - Cont. Vanc & zosyn (D1 [**4-6**]), azithromycin stopped, MRSA screen neg,
   but now neutropenic
   - Cont neutropenic precautions
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - f/u glucan pending, galactomannan neg (drawn 1 hr after 1^st dose of
   zosyn)
   - hold carvedilol, spironolactone, lisinopril for hypotension
   - ID recs: Try to obtain adequte sputum sample, BAL if worsens, hold on
   empiric fungal coverage
   .
   2.  Respiratory distress:  Resolved.  After arrival to MICU, after
   getting 3.5 L of IVF, patient developed acute respiratory distress,
   hypertension, tachycardia, diffuse wheezing, and blood-tinged sputum.
   History was consistent with flash pulmonary edema, and responded with
   lasix 40IV, morphine 1 mg, lopressor 5 mg IV.  Lung exam, respiratory
   distress, and O2 requirements improved with these interventions.  CT
   chest showed LLL consolidation c/w PNA, so getting vanco/zosyn. Appears
   to be typical organism, so Azithro d/c
   - wean O2 as possible
 now on 2-3L NC
   - vanco/zosyn for PNA
   .
   3.  Syncope.  Syncope at dialysis likely secondary to cerbral
   hypoperfusion in setting of hypotension from pneumonia.  EKG has no
   ischemic changes. Ruled out for AMI. Now on pressors to maintain MAPS >
   65. Tolerating OOB to chair w/o symptoms.
   .
   4. CKD. ESRD, on HD. Nephrology following, their assistance
   appreciated.  [**Month (only) 51**] need to titrate up levophed during HD.
   - continue nephrocaps, Ca acetate
   - regular diet, per nutrition recs

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 73 yo male with NHL on Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**], ESRD
   on HD, here with fever, hypotension, and new LLL infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for pneumosepsis.
   .
   1. Pneumonia, Sepsis, Hypotension, Fever:  Improving. Chest CT with
   clear evidence of new LLL pneumonia.  RLL pneumonia appears improved
   compared to prior, though given length of course, concerning for
   potential atypical process or fungal infection.  Low IgG likely related
   to therapy for NHL and may predispose patient to pneumonia. Awaiting
   culture data, sputum cx inadequate. Now with ANC of <500. Afebrile x
   24hrs. Off Levophed x24hrs, including during dialysis.
   - Cont. Vanc & zosyn (D1 [**4-6**]), azithromycin stopped, MRSA screen neg,
   but now neutropenic
   - Cont neutropenic precautions
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - f/u glucan pending, galactomannan neg (drawn 1 hr after 1^st dose of
   zosyn)
   - hold carvedilol, spironolactone, lisinopril for hypotension
   - ID recs: Try to obtain adequte sputum sample, BAL if worsens, hold on
   empiric fungal coverage
   .
   2.  Respiratory distress:  Resolved.  After arrival to MICU, after
   getting 3.5 L of IVF, patient developed acute respiratory distress,
   hypertension, tachycardia, diffuse wheezing, and blood-tinged sputum.
   History was consistent with flash pulmonary edema, and responded with
   lasix 40IV, morphine 1 mg, lopressor 5 mg IV.  Lung exam, respiratory
   distress, and O2 requirements improved with these interventions.  CT
   chest showed LLL consolidation c/w PNA, so getting vanco/zosyn. Appears
   to be typical organism, so Azithro d/c
   - wean O2 as possible
 now on 2-3L NC
   - vanco/zosyn for PNA
   .
   3.  Syncope.  Syncope at dialysis likely secondary to cerbral
   hypoperfusion in setting of hypotension from pneumonia.  EKG has no
   ischemic changes. Ruled out for AMI. Now on pressors to maintain MAPS >
   65. Tolerating OOB to chair w/o symptoms.
   .
   4. CKD. ESRD, on HD. Nephrology following, their assistance
   appreciated.  [**Month (only) 51**] need to titrate up levophed during HD.
   - continue nephrocaps, Ca acetate
   - renal diet
   .
   5.  Type 2 DM.  On ISS.
   - hold glipizide
   .
   6.  NHL.  S/p Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**]) which is an alkylating
   [**Doctor Last Name **].  It causes pancytopenia with [**Last Name (un) 6472**] at 3 weeks ([**2150-4-15**]).  Also
   can cause hypotension in 6% of patients.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with fever, hypotension, and new left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which is concerning for pneumonia. The patient's initial antibiotics were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin, and he also received azithromycin. His white blood cell count is low (<500), indicating neutropenia.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, sepsis, hypotension, and respiratory distress. He initially required mechanical ventilation but has since been weaned off it and is currently on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring vasopressors, and he has experienced episodes of syncope.

Other medical issues include chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and NHL treated with Bendemustine. The patient's anemia is likely related to his NHL therapy. He is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with subcutaneous heparin.

The patient's electrolytes are replete, and he is on a regular diet. His code status is full code. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires ongoing monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with altered mental status following dialysis. He has been treated for likely lower left lobe pneumonia and has shown an encouraging response. However, he is now experiencing a period of neutropenia following chemotherapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/53-74/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has a distant S2 heart sound. Physical examination findings include diminished breath sounds on the right side, symmetric chest expansion, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurologic examination reveals that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to lower left lobe pneumonia. This condition requires ongoing antibiotic therapy and close monitoring of vital signs.

2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of ESRD, which requires ongoing dialysis treatment. This will need to be continued throughout his stay in the ICU.

3. Lymphoma: The patient's diagnosis"
