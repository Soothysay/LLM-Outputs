","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU for poor mental status, worsening hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and new bacteremia. The patient had a previous mini-BMT (bone marrow transplant) and is currently experiencing worsening pneumonia with positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci (GPCs). The patient has developed atrial fibrillation (AF) and is unable to take rate-controlling agents. Additionally, the patient has guaiac positive stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding, and a falling hematocrit level, leading to the administration of a blood transfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and worsening pneumonia indicate an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt management.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The guaiac positive stool suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to be evaluated and managed promptly to prevent further blood loss and potential shock.
4. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates renal insufficiency. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting medications accordingly are important to prevent further deterioration.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's development of AF increases the risk of clot formation and embolic events"

   ====================
   Patient with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely a combination
   of pneumonia and volume overload exacerbated by low serum albumin.
   Adjusting vent now to increase PEEP in effort to raise PaO2 sufficient
   to allow us to reduce FIO2 to initial goal of 0.6. CXR shows collapse
   of left lung, likely due to a mucus plug. If this does not open with
   suctioning, will need bronchoscopy later today. Will need ongoing
   diuresis; restart lasix infusion as hemodynamics allow.
   AFib is chronic with poor rate control. I am concerned that the rapid
   rate is contributing to his CHF with inadequate filling time. Will
   start esmalol drip given failure to respond to diltiazem and oral beta
   blockers.
   Creat up slightly from yesterday. Electrolytes and acid-base status
   accpetable.
   On linezolid for possible VRE with gram positive bacteremia.
   Hct up with transfusion. Continue to monitor with hx of GI bleeding. GI
   service has said in recent past that they had nothing else to offer re:
   UGI source. Possible that some of the bleeding is coming from GVHD of
   colon.
   Continues on immunosuppression for GVHD.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, myeloma, pneumonia, bacteremia, chronic renal failure, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was initially on daptomycin for gram-positive bacteremia but was switched to linezolid. Their heart rate remained high throughout the night despite receiving IV diltiazem and metoprolol boluses. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) rose to the 20's, and their respiratory rate increased to the 20's as well. Lasix boluses were given, followed by a lasix infusion. Antibiotics were added for gram-negative coverage (Aztreonam) for pneumonia. Due to worsening oxygenation with saturation levels in the 70's-80's, the patient was intubated about an hour ago. The patient's blood pressure dropped with intubation, and fluids and phenylephrine were transiently given. The patient is now on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (VT) of 600, assist-control mode, 100% oxygen, rate of 16, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10.

The patient also received a blood transfusion last night for dropping hemoglobin concentration (Hct). The patient is unable to provide history due to being intubated. Allergies include penicillins, rash/anaphylaxis,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a complex medical history, including refractory multiple myeloma, who has undergone mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). He has been admitted multiple times and has developed various complications such as Parainfluenza pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) pneumonias and bacteremia, acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to gentamicin and contrast, right basilic vein thrombus, suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and duodenal ulcer.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with invasive ventilation and has shown signs of respiratory distress, possibly due to pneumonia. He has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR), including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). He has also been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia, hepatic abnormalities, and delirium. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he is currently being evaluated for delirium.

The patient's medical team is working on controlling his atrial fibrillation with RVR, managing his GPC bacteremia, treating his respiratory distress, addressing his anemia, and monitoring his hepatic function. They"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [2165-2-25] who underwent mini-allogeneic SCT. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by various medical conditions, including Parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin and contrast treated with HD (off since [5-4]), right basilic vein thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteremia.

The patient currently presents with atrial fibrillation with RVR, GPC bacteremia, respiratory distress with new infiltrate concerning for pneumonia, anemia, mental status changes, LFT abnormalities, and a history of refractory multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has known atrial fibrillation, and the recent development of RVR may be due to infection, anemia, or other factors. The patient is not being anticoagulated due to a duodenal ulcer caused by gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by gram-positive cocci, which could be a result of multiple sources including recent midline access, gut translocation, and indwelling lines.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress with new infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting the possibility of pneumonia. Given the prolonged hospital stay, the patient is at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped, indicating anemia. This could be secondary to chronic blood loss from a duodenal ulcer or other causes.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, suggesting delirium. Immunosuppression and multiple medical comorbidities may contribute to this condition. Meningitis is also a concern in an immunosuppressed host.
6. LFT Abnormalities: The patient's liver function tests show abnormalities, indicating a cholestatic pattern with transaminitis. The etiology is unclear, but medication effects or progression of GVHD to the liver are possibilities.
7. Refractory Multiple Myeloma: The patient's underlying condition of refractory multiple myeloma continues to be a concern, especially considering the increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be required to confirm the presence of these complications and guide appropriate management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with enterococcus and GNR bacteremia. 

Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is in septic shock, which is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection. The presence of enterococcus and GNR bacteremia indicates an ongoing infection that needs to be treated promptly. The patient is already on antibiotics, including daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), tobramycin for pseudomonas coverage, and amphotericin B for fungal infections. However, the antibiotics may need to be adjusted based on culture results. In addition, the patient requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is still requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His respiratory distress is likely due to the underlying sepsis and possible pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABGs) is necessary to evaluate oxygenation and ventilation. Adjustments to the ventilator settings and FiO2 may be required to maintain adequate oxygenation.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient remains tachycardic"

   We are making some headway with his oxygenation. Based on his body
   habitus, suspect that pleural pressures are elevated and we will
   probably need to continue with high levels of PEEP for now. Attempting
   to get FIO2 down to or below 60%.
   With increase in PEEP, will need ongoing volume resuscitation.
   Continues to be hypotensive and capillary refill is delayed today.
   Would like to stop Neo and try leveophed, with careful monitoring re:
   heart rate. If tachycardia worsens, will need to go back to
   phenylephrine. Goal is to maximize oxygen delivery.
   Tachycardia persists despite amiodarone drip. Replete potassium.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint includes acute respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, acute renal failure, and acidosis. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Oxygenation has been variable, with an increase in PEEP to 16 cmH2O resulting in improved oxygenation and a reduction in FiO2.

The patient continues to be hypotensive and requires vasopressor support. There is evidence of ongoing bleeding, as indicated by the presence of melena in the stool and a positive guaiac test. The patient has pancytopenia with low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count.

The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges, but there is a slight elevation in lactate levels, suggesting possible tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's cardiac troponin T level is normal, indicating no evidence of acute coronary syndrome.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, morphine, and linezolid. The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, including meropenem, tobramycin, acyclovir, and voriconazole.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 139 bpm, blood pressure of 112/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 60% FiO2. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37."

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and septic shock. The patient has enterococcus and GNR bacteremia. 

The assessment and plan include:

1. Septic shock:
- Continue daptomycin for VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus).
- Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (patient now desensitized).
- Continue Tobramycin for double pseudomonas coverage.
- Change neo to norepinephrine to increase perfusion.
- Continue IV fluids (IVF) as needed with a goal central venous pressure (CVP) of 20.
- Follow up cultures and speciation.

2. Respiratory distress:
- Continue on ventilator with FiO2 decreased to 60% this morning.
- Continue ABGs (arterial blood gases) to evaluate PaO2 (partial pressure of oxygen).
- Continue antibiotics as above.

3. Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
- Continue amiodarone.
- Cardiology consult to discuss alternatives.
- Monitor heart rate (HR).
- If HR increases on norepinephrine, will change back to phenylephrine.

4. Anemia:
- Hct checks every 6 hours until stable.
- Transfuse to keep Hct > 25.
- Continue PPI (proton pump inhibitor) IV.
- Guaiac stools.
- IR (interventional radiology) embolization pending improvement in clinical status (contact: [**Name (NI)**] [**Pager number 9262**]).

5. Mental status:
- Treat above and reassess.
- Haldol (haloperidol) prn (as needed) for agitation.
- NPO (nothing by mouth) for now.
- In this immunosuppressed host, meningitis on differential.
- Follow up with psych (psychiatry) for delirium.

6. Goals of care:
- Family meeting with family, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle)**] and ICU Team.
- 48-hour goal: improvement in respiratory status and decreased FiO2 requirement.
- 5-day goal: off pressors.

7. LFT abnormalities:
- Trend LFTs (liver function tests).

8. Refractory multiple myeloma:
- Admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p (status post) mini-allogeneic SCT (stem cell transplant).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock. The patient has enterococcus and GNR bacteremia. His respiratory distress requires ongoing ventilator support, and his FiO2 has been decreased to 60%. The patient also has anemia with an 8cm ulcer seen on EGD yesterday. He is being treated with PPI IV and transfused to maintain Hct > 25. The patient's mental status is described as waxing and non-focal, with suspected delirium in the setting of multiple medical comorbidities. The family is aware of the patient's condition and wishes to continue aggressive care. The goals of care include improvement in respiratory status and decreased FiO2 requirement within 48 hours, as well as being off pressors within 5 days. There are also abnormalities in liver function tests with a cholestatic picture and transaminitis, which may be due to medication effect, progression of GVHD to the liver, or other causes. The patient underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is now increasing immunosuppression for GVHD. The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer and is NPO for now due to bacteremia and lack of available central access. TPN will be initiated pending improvement in bacteremia and possible line placement."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who was admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He currently has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock. The patient has enterococcus and GNR bacteremia. He is receiving daptomycin for VRE, tobramycin for pseudomonas coverage, vasopressin, and norepinephrine to increase perfusion. The patient is also on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 decreased to 50%. His CXR shows persistent bilateral infiltrates with probable left lower lobe atelectasis. 

Other assessments and plans include:
- Anemia: The patient has an 8cm ulcer seen on EGD. He received 3 units of PRBCs yesterday and will continue to have Hct checks every 6 hours until stable. His Hct should be kept above 30. Proton pump inhibitor IV and guaiac stools are also part of the plan. IR embolization is pending improvement in clinical status.
- Oliguria/anuria: The patient's low urine output is likely due to pre-renal cause given low central venous pressures and Fena <1.

   ================
   Patient worse this AM than yesterday afternoon with respect to gas
   exchange and hemodynamics. He is repeatedly intravascularly volume
   depleted because of persistent capillary leak exacerbated by his low
   serum albumin. Urine output less than 20 cc/hr now, although renal
   function has not changed. Concern that he is pre-renal and possibly
   transitioning to ATN; however, we have been unsuccessful at keeping CVP
   up, even with transfusion of blood. Tracking tobramycin level.
    Mixed venous O2 sat is 60%; keep hct at 30 per sepsis protocol.
   Continues to be tachycardic although not any different on vs. off
   levophed.
   NG aspirate continues to show coffee grounds consistent with ongoing
   bleeding from ulcer.
   Platelet count remains low. Consider transfusion of platelets if there
   is evidence that bleeding has increased.
   Unable to start TPN because of venous access issues.
   Will have family meeting with wife today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include acute respiratory failure, hypotension, bacteremia, renal failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's condition has worsened since the previous day, with persistent capillary leak and low serum albumin contributing to intravascular volume depletion. The patient's urine output is less than 20 cc/hr, indicating potential pre-renal azotemia transitioning to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The mixed venous O2 saturation is 60%, indicating poor oxygen utilization by tissues.

The patient's hemodynamics show hypotension with a blood pressure of 85/55 mmHg, despite the use of vasopressin and norepinephrine. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 17 mmHg, which is high, indicating fluid overload.

The respiratory status is concerning with worsening oxygenation, requiring increased FIO2 and PEEP. The patient has persistent bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting ongoing lung injury.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by coffee grounds in the NG aspirate. The platelet count remains low, increasing the risk of bleeding.

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. Renal function tests indicate elevated creatinine levels. Liver enzymes are within normal range, while"

   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock: pt with enterococcus and GNR bacteremia
   -Continue daptomycin for VRE
   -Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)
   -Continue Tobramycin for double pseudomonas coverage
   -Continue vasopressin and levophed to increase perfusion as needed for
   MAP>60, but try and wean off levophed
   -continue IVF PRN with goal CVP = 20
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Pt continues on ventilator AC (Vt 600, RR 14,
   PEEP 16, FiO2 50%) with good saturation in high 90s.
   -change to FiO2 of 40%
   -Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.  Currently on digoxin
   with no improvement.
   -hold digoxin today, patient
s UOP is low and digoxin cannot be
   dialyzed
   -Monitor HR
 if increases on norepinephrine, will change back to
   phenylephrine

   # Thrombocytopenia
 Plt of 14 this AM.  Pt has had recent GI bleed
   which is at the moment resolved
   - tranfuse to goal of Plt > 10
   .
   # Oliguria/anuria:  Likely prenal cause of low UOP given low CVPs and
   Fena<1, will continue to bolus IVFs to maintain UOP>30 cc/hr.  Concern
   for possible ATN given periods of hypotension and septic shock.  Also
   worry about renal damage from tobramycin given previous renal failure
   from gentamicin.  Urine showed hyaline casts
   - monitor UOP, bolus IVF for UOP>30

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including septic shock, respiratory failure, upper gastrointestinal bleed, bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has enterococcus and GNR bacteremia, indicating a severe infection that has led to septic shock. He is receiving appropriate antibiotics, vasopressin, and norepinephrine to maintain perfusion. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and cultures is necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress. His current settings include Vt 600, RR 14, PEEP 16, and FiO2 50%. Regular ABG analysis will be required to evaluate oxygenation levels.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient remains tachycardic despite treatment with amiodarone, digoxin, and other rate/rhythm control methods. Monitoring of heart rate and adjusting medication doses will be essential.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 30.2% and an 8cm ulcer seen on EGD. Frequent Hct checks and blood transfusion may be necessary to maintain a stable hemoglobin level.

   Oxygenation improved over the past 24 hours. We have reduced FIO2 to
   40%; if O2 sats remain good, would reduce PEEP to 14. If O2 sats remain
   stable for several hours, try to reduce PEEP to 12.
   BP improved. Off levophed. Continue vasopressin for 24 hours after
   levophed stopped.
   Maintain present antibiotics.
   Creat stable, but urine output remains quite poor. Hold digoxin.
   Tobramycin being monitored closely.
   Will begin tube feedings. Hct stable for 2 days now. Not at transfusion

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, acute renal failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient requires mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and has reduced oxygenation requirements. There is evidence of left-sided alveolar infiltrates on the chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring the use of vasopressor medications. There is also a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by melena. The patient is septic and in shock. The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and signs of kidney dysfunction. Imaging studies reveal left-sided alveolar infiltrates, suggesting pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation. Complications may include further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, leading to increased risk of pneumonia or other respiratory infections.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite the use of vasopressor medications. This could indicate ongoing septic shock or inadequate cardiovascular response. Complications may include organ perfusion abnormalities and potential cardiovascular collapse.

3. Pneumonia: The presence of left-sided alveolar infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggests pneumonia. Complications may include worsening respiratory function, systemic infection, and potential septic shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock: Resolving. Pt with enterococcus and GNR bacteremia,
   still with 4/4 GPC on blood cx
   -Continue daptomycin for VRE
   -Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)
   -Continue holding Tobramycin for double pseudomonas coverage (hold
   until level <2)
   -Continue vasopressin to increase perfusion as needed for MAP>60
   -continue IVF PRN with goal CVP = 18
   -consider changing A. line as possibly colonized
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Pt continues on ventilator AC (Vt 600, RR 14,
   PEEP 12, FiO2 40%) with good saturation in high 90s.
   -change to PEEP to 10
   -Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.  Currently off digoxin
   as his renal function is poor and has difficultly clearing it.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with 8cm ulcer seen on EGD.
   - continue to check hct q6 hours
   - transfuse to keep Hct>30
   - guaiac stools
   - IR Embolization pending improvement in clinical status (contact:
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1313**] [**Pager number 9262**])
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 s/p 1 unit of plt yesterday.  Pt has had recent GI
   bleed which is at the moment resolved
   - tranfuse to goal of Plt > 20
   .
   # Renal failure:  Improving with increased BPs.  Creat up marginally
   from yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] have element of ATN or aminoglycoside toxicity.
   With improved hemodynamics, we hope that renal function will improve.
   Will diurese gently later today as he is massively volume overloaded.
   - monitor UOP, bolus IVF for UOP>30
   .
   # Goals of care: d/w family yesterday re: pt
s status. Family is aware
   of condition. Given that pt has survived through multiple prior
   episodes, family would like to continue aggressive care at this time.
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture with transaminitis.
   Unclear etiology though med effect, progression of GVHD to liver
   possibilities.
   - Trend LFTs
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
   - cont Methylpred 30 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number 1975**] mg IV BID, Atovaquone

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, septic shock, respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through a port.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is still at risk for septic shock due to the presence of enterococcus and GNR bacteremia. It is important to continue antibiotics, vasopressin, and fluid resuscitation as needed to maintain adequate perfusion.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjustment of ventilator settings may be necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's tachycardia needs to be closely monitored, and further rate/rhythm control methods may be required.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to chronic blood loss from his 8 cm ulcer seen on EGD. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed are necessary. Additionally, guaiac stool testing should be continued.
5. Thrombocytopenia"

","The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock. The patient has several medical complications including septic shock, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104 to 153 mmHg, respiratory rate of 1 breath per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with general appearance described as anasarca in NAD. Physical examination findings include soft S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs or gallops, atrial fibrillation with tachycardia, 4+ pitting edema diffusely, and warm extremities.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, elevated creatinine at 1.8 mg/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 14. Other lab abnormalities include elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's sputum culture shows sensitivity to tobramycin, while the blood culture is positive for GPC. The chest X-ray reveals bilateral infiltrates unchanged from yesterday, with probable left lower lobe atelectasis but no central mucus plug.

The patient's current plan includes continuing daptomycin for VRE, continuing tobra and vasopressin, weaning off levophed, maintaining CVP at 20, changing FiO2 to 40%, and continuing antibiotics as above for respiratory distress. For atrial fibrillation with RVR, the plan is to hold digoxin today, monitor heart rate, and change back to phenylephrine if the heart rate increases on norepinephrine. The patient's anemia will be monitored with Hct checks every six hours, and transfusions will be given to maintain Hct>30. The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 14, which will be treated with transfusions to achieve a platelet count >10. 

The patient's oliguria/anuria will be managed by bolus IVFs to maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, and there is concern for possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given periods of hypotension and septic shock. The patient's goals of care are to continue aggressive care as per family's wishes. Additionally, the patient has liver function test abnormalities, a sacral decubitus ulcer, and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   =======================
   Hemodyanamics have improved. Now off all vasopressors. Will begin

   Oxygenation stable on 40% supplemental O2.  Will decrease PEEP to 10
   now; if stable, reduce to 8 later today. Will probably need to achieve
   negative fluid balance for a number of days before contemplating
   extubation.
   Hct. Stable. No evidence of ongoing bleeding. With vasopressors off, we
   may have a port to start TPN and will hold on tube feedings. Continue
   on PPI.
   Creat up marginally from yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] have element of ATN or

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint includes acute respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition has shown some improvement as they are now off levophed and vasopressin, with improved urine output and oxygenation. However, the patient still requires respiratory support and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, necessitating mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Sepsis: The presence of pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bacteremia indicates a systemic infection, which may lead to sepsis or septic shock.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function, which may progress to acute renal failure.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, posing a risk of continued blood loss and potential need for transfusion.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can lead to an irregular heartbeat and potential complications such as stroke or clot formation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their critical condition, including respiratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] who now presents with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock. 

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, septic shock, gastrointestinal bleed (melena), bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation. 

The respiratory failure is indicated by the need for increased PEEP and FiO2 due to desaturation. The septic shock seems to be resolving but the patient still has enterococcus and GNR bacteremia, indicating ongoing infection. 

The gastrointestinal bleed is suggested by the presence of melena and the need for transfusion due to thrombocytopenia. 

The atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is refractory to multiple medications and rate/rhythm control methods. 

Other issues include anemia with an 8cm ulcer seen on EGD, renal failure with improved BPs and creatinine levels, and liver function test abnormalities with a cholestatic picture and transaminitis. 

The patient's goals of care are to continue aggressive care as per family preference. 

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing antibiotics, holding tobramycin for double pseudomonas coverage, vasopressin to increase perfusion, IVF PRN with goal CVP = 18, considering changing arterial line as possibly colonized, and adding gentamic"

   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.  Currently off digoxin
   as his renal function is poor and has difficultly clearing it.  Given
   better hemodynamics, can be tried on nodal agents.  Dilt drip in past
   has not been shown to be very effective, will try lopressor
   -Monitor HR
   - start metoprolol 5 mg IV q6

   # Renal failure:  Improving with increased BPs.  Creat up marginally
   from yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] have element of ATN or aminoglycoside toxicity.
   With improved hemodynamics, we hope that renal function will improve.
   Will diurese gently later today as he is massively volume overloaded.
   - monitor UOP
   - no IV fluids
   - diurese with lasix drip for goal of 1 L negative

   # Goals of care: d/w family yesterday re: pt
s status. Family is aware
   of condition. Given that pt has survived through multiple prior
   episodes, family would like to continue aggressive care at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock. The patient also has respiratory failure, upper gastrointestinal bleed, bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation.

Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently resolving from septic shock caused by enterococcus and GNR bacteremia. The plan is to continue daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), hold Tobramycin until blood culture results are below 2, continue vasopressin to increase perfusion, and continue IV fluids as needed to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 18.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator settings of Vt 600, RR 14, PEEP 12, and FiO2 40%. The plan is to change PEEP to 10 and continue antibiotics.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient remains tachycardic despite receiving amiodarone and other rate/rhythm control methods. The plan is to monitor the heart rate.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with an 8cm ulcer seen on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The plan is to transfuse blood products"

   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Patient's BP remains stable off of vasorpessors. Oxygenation was good
   on 50% supplemental oxygen. PEEPhad been  reduced to 10. This AM, OG
   tube became dislodeged. Patient had more secretions from ETT and O2
   sats dropped. PEEP raised again to 14.

   Hemodynamics remain stable. Starting to diurese. Renal function
   improving. Fluid goal should be 1-2L negative today.
   Oxygenation worsened today; possibly some aspiration around the tube vs
   new pneumonia. CXR shows improvement on the right. During rounds we did
   a recruitment maneuver and O2 sats improved to 99%. Will keep on PEEP
   14 for now. If sats remain good, reduce FIO2 to 40%. If still stable,
   reduce PEEP to 12. Would not go below 10 of PEEP until we have been
   able to diurese significantly.
   Hct stable. Not at transfusion threshold.
   Platelets up today post transfusion. WBC also up.

The patient's blood pressure remains stable off vasopressors, oxygenation is good on 50% supplemental oxygen, and PEEP has been reduced to 10. However, the patient's OG tube became dislodged, leading to increased secretions from the ETT and a drop in O2 saturation. PEEP was raised again to 14.

The patient's arterial line was stopped, and blood cultures were obtained. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide a history. Allergies include penicillins, rash/anaphylaxis, morphine, nausea/vomiting, and dilaudid-hp (hydromorphone Hcl/pf), nausea/vomiting, meropenem, and unknown.

The patient has received various antibiotics, including voriconazole, daptomycin, meropenem, acyclovir, and ciprofloxacin. Infusions include midazolam (versed) and fentanyl. Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix) and fentanyl. Other medications are also listed.

   # Septic shock: Resolving. Ventilation has improved and has been off
   vasopressin has been off since 8AM [**6-23**], levophed off since [**6-22**]. Pt with
   continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis recommended by ID to evaluate for bowel wall
   thickening as pt continuing to grow enterococcus. However, Due to
   ulcer, difficult to insert OG tube for PO contrast and no access for IV
   contrast. Thus, CT not helpful per radiology to evaluate bowel without
   contrast.
   -PICC placement discussed with IV team to replace subclavian given
   persistent bacteremia and concern for seeded CVL; PICC can only be
   double lumen so pt will only have access for TPN and antibiotics with
   no access for blood products if necessary. Thus, will keep current
   subclavian and continue surveillance cultures. If pt decompensates or
   becomes hemodynamically unstable, will place new CVL and remove current
   subclavian.
   -Change daptomycin to Linezolid for VRE as Enterococcus is sensitive to
   linezolid
   -Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He now has atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock. The patient continues to have enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. There are multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is still experiencing septic shock despite previous improvement. The continued presence of enterococcus bacteremia indicates an ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with improved oxygenation but still requires support. Weaning off the ventilator will depend on further improvement.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has an 8 cm duodenal ulcer, which may be contributing to the gastrointestinal bleed. Monitoring for melena or other signs of bleeding is important.
4. Bacteremia: The patient continues to have enterococcus bacteremia, which is resistant to vancomycin. Treatment with linezolid has been initiated.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR persists despite multiple rate/rhythm control methods. Monitoring the heart rate and continuing metoprolol are recommended.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to chronic disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed are necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He has atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed (melena), bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation. He is in the ICU and has been treated with various medications and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is still resolving from septic shock, and there is a risk of recurrence if proper infection control measures are not maintained.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilator support for respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator will depend on his ability to maintain oxygenation and adequate gas exchange.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has an ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleed, which may require further intervention such as endoscopy or embolization.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has enterococcus and GNR bacteremia, which needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient remains tachycardic despite treatment with amiodarone and other rate/rhythm control methods. Continued monitoring of heart rate and potential adjustment of medications is necessary.
6. Anemia: The patient has significant blood loss, leading to anemia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed are required.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include acute respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, and acute renal failure. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide a history.

From the progress note, the following assessments and plans can be summarized:

1. Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory function is improving. FiO2 has been reduced to 0.4 with PEEP set at 12. Diuresis has been initiated, resulting in a negative fluid balance.

2. Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is stable off vasopressors, indicating improvement in cardiovascular stability.

3. Renal function: The patient's renal function continues to improve.

4. Infection: Blood culture from 6/23 was positive for gram-positive cocci. The patient has recurrent positive cultures, suggesting ongoing infection. The central line may need to be changed if fever develops or more positive blood cultures are obtained.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has upper gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), possibly due to GI bleed or GIB.

6. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib, which is currently being monitored.

7. Nutrition: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids has been initiated.

8. Prophylaxis: Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots, stress ulcer prevention with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and"

   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on

   .
   # Septic shock: Resolving. Ventilation has improved and has been off
   vasopressin has been off since 8AM [**6-23**], levophed off since [**6-22**]. Pt with
   continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis recommended by ID to evaluate for bowel wall
   thickening as pt continuing to grow enterococcus. However, Due to
   ulcer, difficult to insert OG tube for PO contrast and no access for IV
   contrast. Thus, CT not helpful per radiology to evaluate bowel without

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock. He has several medical complications that require careful management. 

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which needs to be treated with appropriate wound care.
2. Septic shock: The patient is resolving from septic shock, but still has a persistent enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. A CT abdomen/pelvis is recommended to evaluate for bowel wall thickening as the patient continues to grow enterococcus. However, due to an ulcer, it is difficult to insert an OG tube for PO contrast and no access for IV contrast. Therefore, the CT will not be helpful per radiology to evaluate the bowel without contrast.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient remains on the ventilator but has been weaned to a tidal volume of 600, respiratory rate of 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% with good saturation in the high 90s.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He now presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock. The patient has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, upper gastrointestinal bleed, bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation. He has been diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory distress, edema, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and liver function test abnormalities. The patient underwent a mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation on [**2165-2-25**] and has increasing immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to sacral decubitus ulcer. This condition can lead to increased risk of infection and pressure ulcers.
2. Septic shock: The patient has septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection leads to dangerous changes in blood pressure and circulation. If not treated promptly, it can result in organ failure and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation support for respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to his underlying conditions.
4. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has upper gastrointestinal bleed, likely secondary to an 8 cm duodenal ulcer"

   Respiratory status improving. Placed on PSV 5, PEEP 5 this AM. O2 sats
   greater than 95%. Will give more lasix today to achieve negative fluid
   balance of [**11-15**].5 L. Will reduce sedation and determine if we can move
   to bolus sedation.
   Heart rate coming under better control with beta blocker.
   Hemodynamics remain stable; no hypotension off pressors for over 48
   hours.
   Hct has drifted down over several days. Will transfuse PRBCs today
   given the potential for large GI bleed from ulcer. Platelet count
   acceptable today.
   Renal function improving.
   Will try to place PICC line today. Adjusting meds to determine if we
   can get by with 2 ports and remove subclavian line.
   Continuing antibiotics for VRE in blood and gram negative rods in
   sputum.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include acute respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bacteremia, and acute renal failure. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide a history. Oxygenation is stable with the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV). Fluid balance remains positive despite the administration of lasix. An unsuccessful attempt was made at left internal jugular (IJ) line placement, resulting in platelet transfusion. Beta blockers have been increased for atrial fibrillation and tachycardia management. Renal function continues to improve, and hemodynamics are stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's critical condition may lead to pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.
2. Shock, septic: The presence of bacteremia and ongoing fluid resuscitation suggests a potential risk of septic shock.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is improving with the use of PSV and reduced PEEP, indicating progress away from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB): The patient has a history of anemia and thrombocytopenia, which could be related to an upper GI bleed.
5. Bacteremia:"

   CXR: poor quality
   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock: Resolving. Ventilation has improved and has been off
   vasopressin has been off since 8AM [**6-23**], levophed off since [**6-22**]. Pt with
   continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis recommended by ID to evaluate for bowel wall
   thickening as pt continuing to grow enterococcus. However, Due to
   ulcer, difficult to insert OG tube for PO contrast and no access for IV
   contrast. Thus, CT not helpful per radiology to evaluate bowel without
   contrast.
   -PICC placement discussed with IV team to replace subclavian given
   persistent bacteremia and concern for seeded CVL; PICC can only be
   double lumen so pt will only have access for TPN and antibiotics with
   no access for blood products if necessary. Thus, will keep current
   subclavian and continue surveillance cultures. IJ line placement
   attempted yesterday, with no success.  IR to place IJ line today.
   -Change daptomycin to Linezolid for VRE as Enterococcus is sensitive to
   linezolid
   -Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)
 increase to q6h dosing
   -Start gentamicin 250mg IV daily checking peak and trough on 4th dose
   as per ID
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Pt continues on ventilator AC, weaned to Vt
   600, RR 14, PEEP 8, FiO2 40% with good saturation in high 90s. RSBI
   this AM is 48.
   - Trial of pressure support today on [**3-19**].  Will continue to try and
   wean patient off ventilator
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Edema: Pt was +700cc yesterday.  Received Lasix 40mg IV yesterday
   with good UOP response, but pt is still currently in positive fluid
   balance.
   - Lasix 40 IV TID with goal of [**11-16**] L negative today
   - monitor UOP
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Continue metoprolol 7.5mg IV q4h now that BP has improved.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with 8cm duodenal ulcer seen on EGD.
   - check hct q12 hours
   - transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - ordered for 1 U pRBC, f/u repeat hct
   - guaiac stools
   - reserved 3 U of matched pRBC with blood bank for IR procedure today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 stable, received 1 U platelets yesterday for IJ
   access attempt.
   - Plt goal > 20
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] who now has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock. The patient continues to have enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications including respiratory distress, edema, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing bacteremia and septic shock indicate a potential risk for recurrent or worsening sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation suggest a risk for respiratory failure if weaning from the ventilator is unsuccessful.
3. Kidney Injury: The patient's renal failure and positive fluid balance indicate a risk for further kidney injury or deterioration in kidney function.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver function abnormalities, including elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, suggest a risk for ongoing liver dysfunction or progression to more severe liver damage.
5. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and recent massive gastrointestinal bleed indicate a risk for further bleeding episodes.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and positive fluid balance increase the risk of developing DVT.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Received 7 units RBCs, 1 FFP, 1 platelet, about 5
   L NS during massive transfusion for large GI bleed per rectum.  Area
   was embolized by IR and hct has been stable since.  BP briefly
   supported by neo drip during resuscitation but stabilized and off
   pressors since return to ICU.  Continues on the vent.  Plan to evaluate
   for possible end organ damage with EKG, cardiac enzymes, good neuro
   exam after sedation weaned and monitoring creatinine.
   -f/u EKG
   - maintain UOP>30cc/hr, hct>25, MAP>60, CVP 10-12
   - use LR for IVF needs as developed non-gap hyperchloremic met acidosis
   - maintain plt > 50 for removal of femoral artery sheath
   .
   # Bacteremia: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to
   vancomycin.  Central line was changed from R subclavian to R IJ by IR
   yesterday prior to GI bleed.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis recommended by ID to evaluate for bowel wall
   thickening as pt continuing to grow enterococcus. However, Due to
   ulcer, difficult to insert OG tube for PO contrast and no access for IV
   contrast. Thus, CT not helpful per radiology to evaluate bowel without
   contrast.
   - surveillance blood cx today
   - Linezolid for VRE
   -Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)
 increase to q6h dosing
   -Gentamicin 250mg IV daily checking peak and trough on 4th dose as per
   ID
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt continues on ventilator AC with good ABG.
   Was not breathing over the vent during this morning
s exam.
   - Continue AC vent
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Edema: Pt was +13 L yesterday after massive transfusions of blood
   products and crystalloids.  Will continue to provide these fluids (LR
   for IVF) and blood products to maintain parameters mentioned above.
   - no diuresis plans today
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt s/p IR embolization after massive GI bleed yesterday with
   likely source 8cm duodenal ulcer seen on previous EGD.  Hct stable over
   past 12 hours.
   - check hct q6 hours
   - transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 stable, received 1 unit platelets this AM for
   planned femoral sheath removal
   - Plt goal > 50
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - restart TPN today, nutrition increased insulin to 65 units
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Renal failure:  Creatinine stable after hemorrhagic shock yesterday
   but will continue to monitor for signs of ATN
   - monitor UOP, creatinine
   - maintain UOP>30 with LR and blood as needed
   .
   # Small gap metabolic acidosis present with concomitant nongap
   acidosis; likely due to massive volume resuscitation.
   -LR instead of NS for IVF
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.  DDx include hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med
   effect, progression of GVHD to liver.
   - Trend LFTs at this time.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock. The patient has had several medical complications since admission, including hemorrhagic shock, bacteremia, respiratory failure, edema, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, liver function abnormalities, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

The patient experienced a massive gastrointestinal bleed around 5 pm, which was embolized by interventional radiology (IR) and followed by a massive transfusion protocol with 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 1 unit of platelets. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been stable since then. The patient's blood pressure was briefly supported by norepinephrine during resuscitation but has stabilized and is no longer on pressors.

The patient has an ongoing enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) has been identified, and the central line was changed from the right subclavian to the right internal jugular by IR yesterday prior to the GI bleed. Surveillance blood cultures are pending, and the patient will be started on linezolid for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation in the ICU with good arterial blood gas (ABG) parameters. He was not breathing spontaneously over the ventilator this morning. The plan is to continue with the assisted control mode ventilation (ACV) and continue antibiotics as previously mentioned.

The patient has significant edema, with a positive fluid balance of 13 liters yesterday after massive transfusions of blood products and crystalloids. The plan is to continue providing these fluids and blood products to maintain the desired parameters of hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient remains tachycardic despite treatment with amiodarone and other rate/rhythm control methods for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Monitoring of the heart rate will continue.

The patient underwent IR embolization after a massive GI bleed yesterday, likely due to an 8 cm duodenal ulcer seen on previous esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient's hematocrit has been stable over the past 12 hours. The plan is to check hematocrit every 6 hours, transfuse as needed to keep hematocrit greater than 25%, and perform guaiac stool tests.

The patient's platelet count has stabilized after receiving 1 unit of platelets this morning for planned femoral sheath removal. The goal is to maintain a platelet count greater than 50,000/mm³.

The patient's hyperglycemia is being managed by restarting total parenteral nutrition (TPN)"

   =========================
   Hemodynamically stable since embolization of his bleeding ulcer.
   Concern about possible ATN, but creat okay this AM and urine output
   adequate. Platelets being repleted to minimize risk of rebleeding.
   Oxygenation acceptable. Patient not initiating sponataneous breaths
   when rate turned down on ventilator. Reduce sedation to assess
   ventilatory controller. Will likely need diuresis before we can
   consider extubation. Bronchospasm may represent interstitial and airway
   edema. Treat with bronchodilators.
   Blood pressure remains below baseline levels. Check ECG and cardiac
   enzymes given prolonged hypotension. Check CVP to assess intravascular
   volume status. Maintain urine output >30 cc/hr.
   Hct acceptable  now. Monitor for evidence of recurrent bleeding.
   Maintain platelets at > 40K.
   Continues on antibiotics for persistent bactermia. Right subclavian
   line removed yesterday. Substantial venous clot; concern for infected
   clot.
   Small gap metabolic acidosis present with concomitant nongap acidosis;
   likely due to massive volume resuscitation. Use lactated Ringers rather
   than NS for any volume needs.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They were admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, hypotension, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient had a massive GI bleed that required embolization and has been experiencing hypotension requiring vasopressors. They were weaned off vasopressors, and their urine output has been adequate. Oxygenation remains acceptable on 40% oxygen and PEEP=5. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins and morphine, as well as nausea/vomiting with certain medications. They have been receiving multiple antibiotics, including daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, and acyclovir. Other ICU medications include midazolam, fentanyl, furosemide, metoprolol, and pantoprazole. 

Physical examination shows the patient to be well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. Their eyes and conjunctiva are normal, but there is scleral edema. The cardiovascular examination reveals very soft heart sounds, and the respiratory/chest examination shows diffuse expiratory wheezes. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show 4+ edema in both lower extremities. Neurologically, the patient is"

   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Received 7 units RBCs, 1 FFP, 1 platelet, about 5
   L NS during massive transfusion for large GI bleed per rectum.  Area
   was embolized by IR and hct has been stable since.  BP briefly
   supported by neo drip during resuscitation but stabilized and off
   pressors since return to ICU.  Continues on the vent.  Plan to evaluate
   for possible end organ damage with EKG, cardiac enzymes, good neuro
   exam after sedation weaned and monitoring creatinine.
   -f/u EKG
   - maintain UOP>30cc/hr, hct>25, MAP>60, CVP 10-12
   - use LR for IVF needs as developed non-gap hyperchloremic met acidosis
   - maintain plt > 50 for removal of femoral artery sheath
   .
   # Bacteremia: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to
   vancomycin.  Central line was changed from R subclavian to R IJ by IR
   yesterday prior to GI bleed.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis recommended by ID to evaluate for bowel wall
   thickening as pt continuing to grow enterococcus. However, Due to
   ulcer, difficult to insert OG tube for PO contrast and no access for IV
   contrast. Thus, CT not helpful per radiology to evaluate bowel without
   contrast.
   - surveillance blood cx today
   - Linezolid for VRE
   -Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)
 increase to q6h dosing
   -Gentamicin 250mg IV daily checking peak and trough on 4th dose as per
   ID
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt continues on ventilator AC with good ABG.
   Was not breathing over the vent during this morning
s exam.
   - Continue AC vent
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Edema: Pt was +13 L yesterday after massive transfusions of blood
   products and crystalloids.  Will continue to provide these fluids (LR
   for IVF) and blood products to maintain parameters mentioned above.
   - no diuresis plans today
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt s/p IR embolization after massive GI bleed yesterday with
   likely source 8cm duodenal ulcer seen on previous EGD.  Hct stable over
   past 12 hours.
   - check hct q6 hours
   - transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 stable, received 1 unit platelets this AM for
   planned femoral sheath removal
   - Plt goal > 50
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - restart TPN today, nutrition increased insulin to 65 units
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Renal failure:  Creatinine stable after hemorrhagic shock yesterday
   but will continue to monitor for signs of ATN
   - monitor UOP, creatinine
   - maintain UOP>30 with LR and blood as needed
   .
   # Small gap metabolic acidosis present with concomitant nongap
   acidosis; likely due to massive volume resuscitation.
   -LR instead of NS for IVF
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.  DDx include hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med
   effect, progression of GVHD to liver.
   - Trend LFTs at this time.
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.

","The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a large gastrointestinal bleed that required embolization by interventional radiology (IR). He has received 7 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 platelet transfusion, and about 5 liters of normal saline (NS) during the massive transfusion. His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been stable since then.

2. Shock: The patient experienced hemorrhagic shock, which was initially supported by norepinephrine (NEO) during resuscitation. However, his blood pressure stabilized and he no longer requires pressors.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (vent) due to acute respiratory failure. His arterial blood gas (ABG) is within acceptable limits, and he is receiving appropriate antibiotics for his condition.

4. Bacteremia: The patient has enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. His central line was changed from the right subclavian to the right internal jugular (RIJ) by IR. Further evaluation is needed, including a CT abdomen/pelvis to assess for bowel wall thickening, as the"

   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Received 7 units RBCs, 1 FFP, 1 platelet, about 5
   L NS during massive transfusion for large GI bleed per rectum.  Area
   was embolized by IR and hct has been stable since.  BP briefly
   supported by neo drip during resuscitation but stabilized and off
   pressors since return to ICU.  Continues on the vent.  Plan to evaluate
   for possible end organ damage with EKG, cardiac enzymes, good neuro
   exam after sedation weaned and monitoring creatinine.
   -f/u EKG
   - maintain UOP>30cc/hr, hct>25, MAP>60, CVP 10-12
   - use LR for IVF needs as developed non-gap hyperchloremic met acidosis
   - maintain plt > 50 for removal of femoral artery sheath
   .
   # Bacteremia: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to
   vancomycin.  Central line was changed from R subclavian to R IJ by IR
   yesterday prior to GI bleed.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis recommended by ID to evaluate for bowel wall
   thickening as pt continuing to grow enterococcus. However, Due to
   ulcer, difficult to insert OG tube for PO contrast and no access for IV
   contrast. Thus, CT not helpful per radiology to evaluate bowel without
   contrast.
   - surveillance blood cx today
   - Linezolid for VRE
   -Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)
 increase to q6h dosing
   -Gentamicin 250mg IV daily checking peak and trough on 4th dose as per
   ID
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt continues on ventilator AC with good ABG.
   Was not breathing over the vent during this morning
s exam.
   - Continue AC vent
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Edema: Pt was +13 L yesterday after massive transfusions of blood
   products and crystalloids.  Will continue to provide these fluids (LR
   for IVF) and blood products to maintain parameters mentioned above.
   - no diuresis plans today
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt s/p IR embolization after massive GI bleed yesterday with
   likely source 8cm duodenal ulcer seen on previous EGD.  Hct stable over
   past 12 hours.
   - check hct q6 hours
   - transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 stable, received 1 unit platelets this AM for
   planned femoral sheath removal
   - Plt goal > 50
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - restart TPN today, nutrition increased insulin to 65 units
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Renal failure:  Creatinine stable after hemorrhagic shock yesterday
   but will continue to monitor for signs of ATN
   - monitor UOP, creatinine
   - maintain UOP>30 with LR and blood as needed
   .
   # Small gap metabolic acidosis present with concomitant nongap
   acidosis; likely due to massive volume resuscitation.
   -LR instead of NS for IVF
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.  DDx include hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med
   effect, progression of GVHD to liver.
   - Trend LFTs at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently experiencing several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleed, septic shock, respiratory failure, bacteremia, atrial fibrillation, hemorrhagic shock, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, liver function test abnormalities, and sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a history of massive gastrointestinal bleed, which has resulted in hemorrhagic shock. There is a risk of re-bleeding or further gastrointestinal complications.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is currently in septic shock, indicating a severe infection that may lead to organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to rely on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or further respiratory deterioration.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. There is a risk of spreading the infection or developing complications related to bacteremia.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, or heart failure.
6. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient experienced hemorrhagic shock due to the gastrointestinal bleed. There is a risk of recurrent hypot"

   GI bleed, not responsive to fluids, requiring levophed.  Received 7
   units RBCs, 1 unit platelets, 5 L IVF prior to IR embolization.
   Gastric lavage showed coffee grounds.  Patient had copious BRBPR.
   Blood loss on the order of [**12-18**] liters.  Embolization to be performed by
   IR.
   - consider sulcrulfate in patient because he now has OG tube
   - consider treatment for H. Pylori
   - bolus LR as needed for BP maintenance
   - maintain UOP>30, MAP>60, CVP 10-12

   - Gentamicin 250mg IV daily checking peak and trough on 4th dose as per
   ID.  (day 3 today)
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt had been doing well on PS, changed to AC in
   the setting of acute GI bleed.
   - Continue AC vent, wean down as tolerated
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Edema: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the acute
   bleed.  Will reassess fluid status.
   - diurese for goal MAP of 60-70

   # Anemia: Pt s/p IR second session of embolization after massive GI
   bleed today with likely source being duodenal ulcer.  Patient received
   a lot of pRBCs.
   - check hct q4 hours
   - transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - guaiac stools
   - check and trend Ca

   # Thrombocytopenia
 stable, received 1 unit platelets this AM for
   planned femoral sheath removal
   - Plt goal > 50 for acute bleed
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - restart TPN today, nutrition increased insulin to 65 units
   - continue ISS

   # Renal failure:  Creatinine stable after hemorrhagic shock yesterday
   but will continue to monitor for signs of ATN
   - monitor UOP, creatinine
   - maintain UOP>30 with LR and blood as needed
   .
   # Small gap metabolic acidosis present with concomitant nongap
   acidosis; likely due to massive volume resuscitation.
   -LR instead of NS for IVF
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.  DDx include hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently experiencing several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, septic shock, respiratory failure, bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient had an episode of hypotension due to an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which was not responsive to fluids. He required the use of levophed and has received 7 units of red blood cells, 1 unit of platelets, and 5 liters of intravenous fluids prior to interventional radiology (IR) embolization. Gastric lavage showed coffee grounds, and the patient had copious blood-tinged respiratory secretions (BRBPR). It is estimated that the patient has lost between 12-18 liters of blood. Embolization will be performed by IR.

The patient also has bacteremia with enterococcus that is resistant to vancomycin. Surveillance blood cultures will be done today, and the patient will be started on linezolid for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). Gentamicin will be administered at a dose of 250mg IV daily, with peak and trough levels checked on the fourth dose as per the infectious disease consultant.

The patient's respiratory status has been stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but has been changed to assist-control (AC) ventilation in the setting of acute gastrointestinal bleed. The plan"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. These potential medical complications include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to impaired respiratory function.

2. Hypotension: The patient has unresponsive hypotension that requires vasopressor support.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient has an irregular heart rhythm.

4. Bacteremia: The patient has a bloodstream infection, as indicated by positive blood cultures.

5. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The patient has significant GI bleeding, likely related to an ulcer. The bleeding has recurred and requires intervention in interventional radiology.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which poses a risk for further bleeding.

7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating ongoing blood loss.

8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a persistent metabolic acidosis, likely due to the ongoing bleeding and inadequate tissue perfusion.

9. Acute renal failure: The patient's initial renal function was compromised, but has since normalized.

10. Impaired skin integrity: There is a mention of impaired skin integrity, but no further details are provided.

It is important to note that these are potential complications based on the information provided in the progress note. The actual diagnosis and management plan should be determined by a healthcare professional after a thorough evaluation of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Patient had episode of hypotension due to upper
   GI bleed, not responsive to fluids, requiring levophed.  Received 7
   units RBCs, 1 unit platelets, 5 L IVF prior to IR embolization.
   Gastric lavage showed coffee grounds.  Patient had copious BRBPR.
   Blood loss on the order of [**12-18**] liters.  Embolization to be performed by
   IR.
   - consider sulcrulfate in patient because he now has OG tube
   - consider treatment for H. Pylori
   - bolus LR as needed for BP maintenance
   - maintain UOP>30, MAP>60, CVP 10-12
   .
   # Bacteremia: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to
   vancomycin.
   - surveillance blood cx today
   - Linezolid for VRE
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)
 increase to q6h dosing
   - Gentamicin 250mg IV daily checking peak and trough on 4th dose as per
   ID.  (day 3 today)
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt had been doing well on PS, changed to AC in
   the setting of acute GI bleed.
   - Continue AC vent, wean down as tolerated
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Edema: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the acute
   bleed.  Will reassess fluid status.
   - diurese for goal MAP of 60-70
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt s/p IR second session of embolization after massive GI
   bleed today with likely source being duodenal ulcer.  Patient received
   a lot of pRBCs.
   - check hct q4 hours
   - transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - guaiac stools
   - check and trend Ca
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 stable, received 1 unit platelets this AM for
   planned femoral sheath removal
   - Plt goal > 50 for acute bleed
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - restart TPN today, nutrition increased insulin to 65 units
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Renal failure:  Creatinine stable after hemorrhagic shock yesterday
   but will continue to monitor for signs of ATN
   - monitor UOP, creatinine
   - maintain UOP>30 with LR and blood as needed
   .
   # Small gap metabolic acidosis present with concomitant nongap
   acidosis; likely due to massive volume resuscitation.
   -LR instead of NS for IVF
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.  DDx include hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med
   effect, progression of GVHD to liver.
   - Trend LFTs at this time.
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
   - cont ppx with atovaquone, acyclovir & voriconazole
   .
   # Access
 patient
s triple lumen did not prove to be enough for
   resuscitative efforts this morning.  Will ask IR to place Lef PICC
   line.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Wound care
   .
   # Goals of care:
    -Made DNR yesterday. NOTE: when calling wife in middle of night - just
   inform her of situation. Do NOT ask if she wants to continue care.
   Goals of care should be addressed with team during daytime, not when
   she's just been woken up due to emergency.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently experiencing several medical complications, including hemorrhagic shock due to an upper gastrointestinal bleed, bacteremia with resistant enterococcus, respiratory failure, edema, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, liver function abnormalities, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), a heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 128/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and intravenous fluids due to the massive GI bleed. He also underwent interventional radiology embolization for the bleed but no source was found. The patient's hematocrit and platelet count are currently being monitored and adjusted accordingly.

The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), for which he is being treated with linezolid. His respiratory status has been complicated by the acute GI bleed, leading to the need for mechanical ventilation. The patient is currently on assisted control ventilation with a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a complex medical history, including refractory multiple myeloma, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, septic shock, hemorrhagic shock, bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, respiratory failure, edema, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and liver function test abnormalities. The patient underwent embolization for a massive gastrointestinal bleed and received blood products and intravenous fluids. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is critical, and his goals of care have been set to do not resuscitate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and received blood products. There is a risk of further bleeding, especially with a low platelet count.
2. Infection: The patient has bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and is on multiple antibiotics. There is a risk of developing new infections or complications related to the current infections.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function, especially with continued exposure to nephrotoxic drugs or further insults.
5. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has liver function test"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He now presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock. The patient has experienced two gastrointestinal bleeds in the past two days, both requiring interventional radiology embolization. He received 7 units of red blood cells, 1 unit of platelets, and 5 liters of intravenous fluids prior to the embolization on [**6-27**], and 2 units of packed red blood cells with 8 additional units crossmatched on [**6-28**]. The patient also has a history of refractory ulcer bleeding, bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, respiratory failure, edema, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, renal failure, and liver function abnormalities. He underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation and is currently in remission. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient experienced massive gastrointestinal bleeding leading to hypotension and required aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion. There is a risk of further bleeding, especially with his history of refractory ulcer bleeding and thrombocytopenia.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enter"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) that failed. He presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and respiratory failure. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which remains tachycardic despite failed digoxin and amiodarone trials. He also has a large duodenal ulcer and enterococcal bacteremia. The patient has been started on empiric coiling of the gastroduodenal artery, pantoprazole infusion, and various antibiotics including linezolid, gentamicin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving sedation and analgesia. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and normal oxygen saturation. He has ongoing fluid losses through various drains, nasogastric tube, and urine output. Laboratory results indicate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and other abnormal values. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory support and hemodynamic monitoring. He is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has multiple lines in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal: The patient has a large duodenal ulcer, which could lead to further"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleed (GIB), which can lead to significant blood loss and potential shock.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, increasing the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. This can be caused by prolonged immobility and poor perfusion.

3. Septic shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension and required pressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating possible septic shock. Infections should be closely monitored and treated promptly.

4. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and low tidal volume (Vt), indicating respiratory distress. This could be due to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or other lung complications.

5. Bacteremia: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and positive blood cultures, suggesting bacteremia. This requires aggressive antibiotic therapy and source control.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a new-onset atrial fibrillation, which can lead to poor cardiac output and embolic events. Rate control and rhythm management are necessary.

7. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) may indicate hepatic injury or dysfunction. Further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying cause.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Two GI bleeds in past two days both sent to IR
   for embolization.  Patient had episode of hypotension due to upper GI
   bleed, not responsive to fluids, requiring levophed.  Received 7 units
   RBCs, 1 unit platelets, 5 L IVF prior to IR embolization on [**6-27**], and 2
   units PRBCs with 8 additional units crossmatched on [**6-28**].  Gastric
   lavage showed coffee grounds.  Patient had copious BRBPR.  Blood loss
   on the order of [**12-18**] liters.  Embolization to be performed by IR.
   - consider sulcrulfate in patient because he now has OG tube
   - consider treatment for H. Pylori
   -Decreased methylprednisone to 20mg [**Hospital1 7**] in effort to decrease steroids
   to assist with ulcer healing
   - surgery reconsulted and he is not surgical candidate
   - bolus LR as needed for BP maintenance
   - maintain UOP>30, MAP>60, CVP 10-12
   .
   # Bacteremia: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to
   vancomycin.
   - surveillance blood cx today
   - Linezolid and gent for VRE
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)
 increase to q6h dosing for
   ESBL E.coli in urine
   - Cipro and [**Last Name (un) 614**] for pseudomonas in sputum and blood
   - Gentamicin 250mg IV daily checking peak and trough on 4th dose as per
   ID.  (day 3 today)
   - Decreased dose of gent to 220mg daily; Gent Peak/trough on [**6-29**]
   (ordered), [**7-1**]
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt had been doing well on AC in the setting of
   acute GI bleed.
   - Continue AC vent, wean down as tolerated
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Edema: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the acute
   bleed.  Will reassess fluid status.
   - holding diuresis for today given large amount of products he received
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization over past two days
   after massive GI bleed today with likely source being duodenal ulcer.
   Patient received 7 units pRBCs [**6-27**] and 2 units [**6-28**].
   - check hct q6 hours
   - transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - guaiac stools
   - check and trend Ca
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 stable, received 3 unit platelets yesterday to
   maintain plts > 50
   - Plt goal > 50 for acute bleed
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - restart TPN today, nutrition increased insulin to 65 units
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Renal failure:  Creatinine stable after hemorrhagic shock but will
   continue to monitor for signs of ATN
   - monitor UOP, creatinine
   - maintain UOP>30 with LR and blood as needed
   .
   # Small gap metabolic acidosis present with concomitant nongap
   acidosis; likely due to massive volume resuscitation.
   -LR instead of NS for IVF
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.  DDx include hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med
   effect, progression of GVHD to liver.
   - Trend LFTs at this time.
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
   - Hem/Onc: Start Foscarnet 90mg/kg [**Hospital1 7**] for empiric CMV treatment (based
   on ideal body weight)- 72 inches --> 80kg ==> 7200mg [**Hospital1 7**].--> will need
   [**Hospital1 7**] lytes. Med not started overnight given need for large fluid
   requirements prior to and during med infusion- awaiting ID opinion
   - cont ppx with atovaquone, acyclovir & voriconazole
   .
   # Access
 now has R PICC, A line, R IJ
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Wound care
   .
   # Goals of care:
    -Made DNR yesterday. NOTE: when calling wife in middle of night - just
   inform her of situation. Do NOT ask if she wants to continue care.
   Goals of care should be addressed with team during daytime, not when
   she's just been woken up due to emergency.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. Antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently being managed with assisted ventilation. Antibiotics are being continued for suspected infections in the sputum and blood.

4. Edema: The patient has received a significant amount of blood products and intravenous fluids, leading to edema. Fluid status is being reassessed.

5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient remains tachycardic despite attempts at rate/rhythm control.

6. Anemia: The patient has received multiple red blood cell transfusions due to massive gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing blood loss.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and they have received platelet transfusions to maintain a platelet count above 50.

8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, and efforts are being made to control them through insulin therapy and total parent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma, who was admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently experiencing hemorrhagic shock due to an acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which has resulted in massive blood loss. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and is being resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol. His condition is unstable, and surgery has been consulted as a last resort. The patient's wife is present and discussing possible palliative care options.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient is actively bleeding and has experienced significant blood loss, leading to hypotension. This condition can further worsen if the bleeding continues.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute GI bleed. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and weaning off the ventilator may be challenging.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has a continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. This infection needs to be treated promptly to prevent complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering his current hemorrhagic state.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating poor glycemic control. This can lead to complications such as infections and delayed wound healing.
6. Renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Massive GI bleed overnight [**6-29**] and through
   morning of [**6-30**] treated with massive transfusion protocol as well as
   two previous bleeds on [**6-27**] and [**6-28**] both sent to IR for embolization.
   Patient became hypotension due to upper GI bleed, not responsive to
   fluids, requiring levophed.  Received 7 units RBCs, 1 unit platelets, 5
   L IVF prior to IR embolization on [**6-27**], and 2 units PRBCs prior to
   embolization on [**6-28**].
   -Decreased methylprednisone to 20mg qAM and 10mg qPM in effort to
   decrease steroids to assist with ulcer healing
   - Family changed code status to DNR: no pressors, blood products, IR,
   surgery, chest compressions (no escalation of care)
   - ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis that may
   have caused 8 cm duodenal ulcer (bleeding source)
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to
   vancomycin.
   - Linezolid and gent for VRE
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)
 increase to q6h dosing for
   ESBL E.coli in urine
   - Cipro and [**Last Name (un) 614**] for pseudomonas in sputum and blood
   - checking Gent peak/trough on [**7-2**] to adjust dosing given renal
   failure
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC vent, wean down as tolerated
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr bumped to 1.4 from 1.2, likely from
   hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock.  Changed ganciclovir
   dosing to q24 from q12.  Suspect some component of ATN.
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the acute
   bleed.  Will reassess fluid status.
   - holding diuresis for today given large amount of products he received
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization over past two days
   after massive GI bleed today with likely source being duodenal ulcer.
   Patient received 7 units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - check cbc daily but will no longer receive blood products per family
   wishes
   - guaiac stools
   - check and trend ionized Ca
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 stable after receiving 5 units of platelets during
   massive transfusion protocol.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - on TPN with insulin
   - continue ISS
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.  DDx include hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med
   effect, progression of GVHD to liver.
   - Trend LFTs at this time.
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
   - cont ppx with atovaquone, ganciclovir & voriconazole
   .
   # Access
 now has R PICC, A line, R IJ
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Wound care
   .
   # Goals of care:
    -DNR with no pressors, blood products, chest compressions, IR,
   surgery.  No escalation of care.  If/when he starts bleeding again,
   will become comfort measures only with increased pain medication as
   needed.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient experienced massive gastrointestinal bleeding overnight on [**6-29**] and throughout the morning of [**6-30**]. He was treated with a massive transfusion protocol. He had two previous bleeds on [**6-27**] and [**6-28**], both sent to interventional radiology (IR) for embolization. The patient became hypotensive due to an upper GI bleed, not responsive to fluids, requiring levophed.

2. Sepsis: The patient has continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. He is being treated with linezolid and gentamicin for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli in urine, as well as pseudomonas in sputum and blood. Gentamicin peak/trough levels will be checked on [**7-2**] to adjust dosing due to renal failure.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has been doing well on assisted control (AC) ventilation. It is planned to continue AC vent, wean down as tolerated, and continue antibiotics as above.

   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Actively bleeding now (>5 L of blood loss via NG
   and rectum) and being resuscitated with blood products through massive
   transfusion protocol.  His wife is at the bedside and discussing
   possible palliative care.  IR willing to try to embolize one more time
   (final attempt to get last segment of GDA) but patient
s weight exceeds
   limit of table on this campus, and he is too unstable to be transported
   to [**Hospital Ward Name **].  Surgery being consulted as last resort.  Two previous
   GI bleeds in past few days both sent to IR for embolization.  Patient
   had episode of hypotension due to upper GI bleed, not responsive to
   fluids, requiring levophed.  Received 7 units RBCs, 1 unit platelets, 5
   L IVF prior to IR embolization on [**6-27**], and 2 units PRBCs with 8
   additional units crossmatched on [**6-28**].
   -Decreased methylprednisone to 20mg [**Hospital1 7**] in effort to decrease steroids
   to assist with ulcer healing
   - surgery reconsulted for possible emergent procedure
   - neo drip to maintain SBP and massive transfusion protocol
   .
   # Bacteremia: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to
   vancomycin.
   - surveillance blood cx today
   - Linezolid and gent for VRE
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now desensitized)
 increase to q6h dosing for
   ESBL E.coli in urine
   - Cipro and [**Last Name (un) 614**] for pseudomonas in sputum and blood
   - Gentamicin 250mg IV daily checking peak and trough on 4th dose as per
   ID.  (day 3 today)
   - Decreased dose of gent to 220mg daily; Gent Peak/trough on [**6-29**]
   (ordered), [**7-1**]
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt had been doing well on AC in the setting of
   acute GI bleed.
   - Continue AC vent, wean down as tolerated
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr bumped to 1.4 from 1.2, likely from
   hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock.  Changed ganciclovir
   dosing to q24 from q12.
   .
   # Edema: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the acute
   bleed.  Will reassess fluid status.
   - holding diuresis for today given large amount of products he received
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization over past two days
   after massive GI bleed today with likely source being duodenal ulcer.
   Patient received 7 units pRBCs [**6-27**] and 2 units [**6-28**].
   - check hct q6 hours
   - transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - guaiac stools
   - check and trend Ca

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He currently has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and septic shock. The patient is actively bleeding and receiving massive transfusion protocol. The family is discussing palliative care, and surgery has been consulted as a last resort. The patient has received multiple blood products and is experiencing several complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient is actively bleeding and has lost more than 5 liters of blood, leading to hemorrhagic shock. He is being resuscitated with blood products through a massive transfusion protocol.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had been doing well on assisted ventilation (AC) but now requires continuous mechanical ventilation due to acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin and is being treated with linezolid and gentamicin for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, necessitating platelet transfusions to maintain platelet levels above 50,000/mL.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels and requires increased insulin dosing.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. The patient now presents with sepsis and massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is receiving mechanical ventilator support. The patient also has severe GI bleed attributed to duodenal ulcer (DU), with no further intervention planned. The patient continues to have enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin, for which linezolid and gentamicin are being used as treatment. The patient is anemic due to GI blood loss. Nutritional support in the form of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is planned. The patient is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and liver function test (LFT) abnormalities. A sacral decubitus ulcer requires wound care. The patient's disposition includes no escalation of care, including no blood products, and a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. In the event of clinical decline, transition to comfort care will be made.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, which requires ongoing mechanical ventilator support. This indicates a critical need for careful monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status.

2. GI Bleeding: The patient has experienced massive GI bleeding, likely due to a duodenal ulcer. This places the patient at risk for continued blood loss and subsequent"

   Assessment and Plan
   61yom refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], and now with
   sepsis and massive GI bleeding.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Continue mechanical ventilator
   support.
   GI BLEED -- severe bleed, attributed to DU.  No further intervention.
   No plans for escalation of care, including no blood products.
   BACTEREMIA -- Continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin
   --> Linezolid and gent for VRE, continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now
   desensitized), Cipro
   ANEMIA -- attributed predominately to GI blood loss.  No further
   escalation of care, including no blood products.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN
   RENAL FAILURE -- monitor creatitine.  At risk for ATN.
   LFT abnormalities -- likely cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.
   SACRAL DECUBITUS ULCER -- Wound care
   DISPOSITION -- Per discussion with wife, no escalation of care
   (incuding no blood products) and DNR (no CPR).  In the event of
   clinical decline, transition to comfort care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma, sepsis, and massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.
- The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.
- The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and morphine.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/81 mmHg to 155/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving multiple medications including sedatives, analgesics, antibiotics, and nutritional support.
- Laboratory results indicate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, and liver function test abnormalities.
- The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer and is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- The patient's family has decided against escalation of care, including no blood products, and has chosen a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status with transition to comfort care if the patient's condition declines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure requires continued mechanical ventilator support.
2. GI Bleeding: The severe gastrointestinal bleed has been attributed to duodenal ulcers, and further intervention or escalation of care, including"

   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Massive GI bleed overnight [**6-29**] and through
   morning of [**6-30**] treated with massive transfusion protocol as well as
   two previous bleeds on [**6-27**] and [**6-28**] both sent to IR for embolization.
   Patient became hypotension due to upper GI bleed, not responsive to
   fluids, requiring levophed.  Received 7 units RBCs, 1 unit platelets, 5
   L IVF prior to IR embolization on [**6-27**], and 2 units PRBCs prior to
   embolization on [**6-28**].
   - continue methylprednisone at 10mg qPM in effort to decrease steroids
   to assist with ulcer healing
   - no escalation of care - no pressors, blood products, IR, surgery,
   chest compressions
   - patient is DNR/DNI
   - continue ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis
   that may have caused 8 cm duodenal ulcer (bleeding source)
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to
   vancomycin.  ID following.
   - Continue Linezolid
   - Decrease dosing of merepenem for ESBL E.coli (pt now desensitized)
   for worsening renal functions as per ID recs
   - Decrease cipro and [**Last Name (un) 614**] for pseudomonas in sputum and blood
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC vent, wean down as tolerated
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Acute renal failure: increased to 1.6 today, likely from hypotensive
   episodes during hemorrhagic shock but also suspecting some component of
   ATN
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the acute
   bleeds.
   - consider diuresis
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Monitor HR
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently experiencing several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleed, septic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anasarca, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and liver function test abnormalities. The patient is in remission from mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation but has increasing immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He has a DNR/DNI status and his current care goals are focused on comfort measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has had multiple episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, including a massive bleed overnight and in the morning. This can lead to hemorrhagic shock and may require further interventions such as embolization or surgery.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is also experiencing septic shock due to an ongoing enterococcus bacteremia that is resistant to vancomycin. This can further compromise his organ function and increase the risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure and is on assisted ventilation. Weaning down the assisted ventilation should be done cautiously due to the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and potential respiratory distress.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs"

   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on

   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Massive GI bleed overnight [**6-29**] and through
   morning of [**6-30**] treated with massive transfusion protocol as well as
   two previous bleeds on [**6-27**] and [**6-28**] both sent to IR for embolization.
   Patient became hypotension due to upper GI bleed, not responsive to
   fluids, requiring levophed.  Received 7 units RBCs, 1 unit platelets, 5
   L IVF prior to IR embolization on [**6-27**], and 2 units PRBCs prior to
   embolization on [**6-28**].
   - continue methylprednisone at 10mg qPM in effort to decrease steroids
   to assist with ulcer healing
   - no escalation of care - no pressors, blood products, IR, surgery,
   chest compressions
   - patient is DNR
   - continue ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis
   that may have caused 8 cm duodenal ulcer (bleeding source)
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to
   vancomycin.  ID following, antibiotic regimen adjusted as per ID
   recommendations
   - Continue Linezolid
   - Decrease dosing of merepenem for ESBL E.coli and pseudomonas coverage
   to 500 mg IV q8h (day 13/14) for worsening renal functions
   - Decrease cipro for pseudomonas in sputum and blood to 400 mg IV daily
   (day [**8-29**]) for worsening renal functions
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC vent, wean down as tolerated
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine increased to 1.6 today from 1.4
   yesterday, likely from hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock
   but also suspecting some component of ATN.  Gentamicin toxicity may
   also be a cause.
   - hold gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the acute
   bleeds.
   - diurese with lasix for net fluid balance of -1 L today
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization over past two days
   after massive GI bleed today with likely source being duodenal ulcer.
   Patient received 7 units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - trend CBC daily
   - no blood products as per family wishes
   - check and trend ionized Ca
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets decreased to 23 today.  Patient
s wife
   has agreed to no further blood products, but the overall impression is
   for us not to perform massive transfusion in setting of another massive
   acute bleed.  Patient is NOT comfort measures only, wife only agreed to
   no escalation of care.  By allowing platelets to continue its downward
   trend, it would precipitate the next massive bleeding episode.  For
   now, will transfuse to goal of plt >20 until further goals of care are
   discussed with family.
   - Check PM platelets
   - Transfuse platelets for goal of plt >20
   - Family meeting for goals of care
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - on TPN with insulin
   - continue ISS
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.  DDx include hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med
   effect, progression of GVHD to liver.
   - Trend LFTs at this time.

   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs

   been moved.  Repeat CXR was obtained which showed that catheter ended
   in SVC.  Is still OK to be used.

   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Massive GI bleed overnight [**6-29**] and through
   morning of [**6-30**] treated with massive transfusion protocol as well as
   two previous bleeds on [**6-27**] and [**6-28**] both sent to IR for embolization.
   Patient became hypotension due to upper GI bleed, not responsive to
   fluids, requiring levophed.  Received 7 units RBCs, 1 unit platelets, 5
   L IVF prior to IR embolization on [**6-27**], and 2 units PRBCs prior to
   embolization on [**6-28**].
   - continue methylprednisone at 10mg qPM in effort to decrease steroids
   to assist with ulcer healing
   - no escalation of care - no pressors, blood products, IR, surgery,
   chest compressions
   - patient is DNR/DNI
   - continue ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis
   that may have caused 8 cm duodenal ulcer (bleeding source)
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to
   vancomycin.  ID following, antibiotic regimen adjusted as per ID
   recommendations
   - Continue Linezolid
   - Decrease dosing of merepenem for ESBL E.coli and pseudomonas coverage
   to 500 mg IV q8h (day 13/14) for worsening renal functions
   - Decrease cipro for pseudomonas in sputum and blood to 400 mg IV daily
   (day [**8-29**]) for worsening renal functions
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC vent, wean down as tolerated
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine increased to 1.6 today from 1.4
   yesterday, likely from hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock
   but also suspecting some component of ATN
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the acute
   bleeds.
   - consider diuresis
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic s/p amniodarone
   drip and many other rate/rhythm control methods.
   -Monitor HR
   .
   # Anemia: Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization over past two days
   after massive GI bleed today with likely source being duodenal ulcer.
   Patient received 7 units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - trend CBC daily
   - no blood products as per family wishes
   - check and trend ionized Ca
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets decreased to 23 today
   - no blood products
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - on TPN with insulin
   - continue ISS
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.  DDx include hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med
   effect, progression of GVHD to liver.
   - Trend LFTs at this time.
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
   - cont ppx with atovaquone, ganciclovir & voriconazole
   .
   # Access
 Has R PICC, A line, R IJ
   - issue with PICC, might have been moved, needs to be reassessed today
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Wound care
   .
   # Goals of care:
    -DNR with no pressors, blood products, chest compressions, IR,
   surgery.  No escalation of care.  If/when he starts bleeding again,
   will become comfort measures only with increased pain medication as
   needed.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now with atrial fibrillation with RVR and septic shock. The patient has experienced several medical complications including hemorrhagic shock due to massive GI bleed, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, bacteremia, and anemia.

The patient's current condition is critical, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has had multiple episodes of GI bleeding, including a massive bleed overnight on [**6-29**] and through the morning of [**6-30**]. This has resulted in hemorrhagic shock and required massive transfusion protocol. There is a risk of further bleeding episodes, which could lead to hypotension and require additional interventions.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on assisted ventilation (AC) and has been doing well. However, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, especially if the patient develops pneumonia or other respiratory infections. Close monitoring and adjustment of the ventilator settings will be necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased to 1.6 today from 1.4 yesterday, likely due to hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, and careful monitoring of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU. He currently has respiratory failure, severe gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, liver function test abnormalities, sacral decubitus ulcer, and is on comfort care with a DNR status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, increased risk of pneumonia, and potential need for tracheostomy or long-term mechanical ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The severe gastrointestinal bleed could recur, leading to hypotension, shock, and further blood loss anemia. There is a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the underlying cause is not addressed.
3. Bacteremia: The continued presence of bacteremia increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate production. This may lead to tissue hypoxia, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially if invasive procedures are required. Platelet transfusion may be necessary to maintain platelet levels above 20,000/microliter"

   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] with atrial fibrillation with RVR and hemorragic shock due to
   large duodenal ulcer.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Stable. No episdoes of bleeding since [**6-30**] and
   SBP stable in 110s. Due to 8cm bleeding duodenal ulcer, possibly due to
   CMV duodenitis.
   - continue methylprednisone at 10mg qPM and 20mg qAM in effort to
   decrease steroids to assist with ulcer healing
   - continue ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis
   - no pressors, blood products, IR, surgery, chest compressions
   .
   # Sepsis: Resolving. BCx [**6-26**] negative and [**Date range (1) 9544**] still pending. SBP
   stable in 100s. ID following, antibiotic regimen adjusted as per ID
   recommendations
   - Continue Linezolid for VRE as this is known source. Pt will likely
   need prolonged abx course.
   - Meropenem 500mg IV q8h (day 14/14)
 has been adjusted for renal
   function
   - Continue Cipro 400mg IV daily (day [**9-29**]) for pseudomonas in sputum
   and blood
has been adjusted for renal function  -d/w ID possibility of
   stopping this.
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely due to volume overload, decreased
   chest compliance given anasarca. Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC ventilator
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine stable at 1.6 today. Likely from
   hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock but also suspecting some
   component of ATN.  Gentamicin toxicity may also be a cause.
   - hold gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the shock
   and acute bleeds. Still positive overnight despite lasix drip.
   - diurese with lasix for net fluid balance of negative every hour.
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic. Not currently
   written for any rate control medications.
   -Will add beta blocker once pt is absorbing POs again.
   -Monitor HR
 may consider diltiazem IV
   .
   # Anemia: Due to massive GI bleed. Hct currently stable. No bleeds
   since [**6-30**]. Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization after massive GI
   bleeds with likely source being duodenal ulcer.  Patient received 7
   units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - trend CBC daily
   - no blood products as per family wishes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets stable at 60 today.  Patient
s wife has
   agreed to no further blood products, but the overall impression is for
   us not to perform massive transfusion in setting of another massive
   acute bleed.  Patient is NOT comfort measures only, wife only agreed to
   no escalation of care.  By allowing platelets to continue its downward
   trend, it would precipitate the next massive bleeding episode.
   - For now, will transfuse to goal of plt >20 until further goals of
   care are discussed with family.
   - Check PM platelets
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - on TPN with insulin
   - continue ISS
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture. DDx include
   hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med effect (gancyclovir gives
   transaminitis), progression of GVHD to liver.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
 have decreased steroids in effort to help
   ulcer healing
   - cont ppx with atovaquone, ganciclovir & voriconazole, although pt not
   currently getting PO meds due to poor absorption.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Wound care
   .
   # Goals of care:
    -DNR with no pressors, blood products, chest compressions, IR,
   surgery.  No escalation of care.  If/when he starts bleeding again,
   will become comfort measures only with increased pain medication as
   needed.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleed (GI Bleed): The patient has a large duodenal ulcer causing significant bleeding. The source of bleeding may be CMV duodenitis. The plan includes continuing methylprednisone to decrease steroids and ganciclovir to treat possible CMV duodenitis.

2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is resolving with negative blood cultures and stable blood pressure. The antibiotic regimen has been adjusted based on ID recommendations.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload and decreased chest compliance caused by anasarca. The patient is currently doing well on assisted ventilation, so continuing AC ventilator support is recommended.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable at 1.6 today. The renal failure is likely due to hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock, ATN, and possible gentamicin toxicity. Holding gentamicin until levels <2 is advised.

5. Anasarca: The patient has developed significant edema due to receiving a lot of blood products and IV fluids. Lasix diuresis has been initiated to manage fluid balance.

6. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:"

   - Meropenem 500mg IV q8h (day 14/14)
 has been adjusted for renal
   function
   - Continue Cipro 400mg IV daily (day [**9-29**]) for pseudomonas in sputum
   and blood
has been adjusted for renal function  -d/w ID possibility of
   stopping this.
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely due to volume overload, decreased
   chest compliance given anasarca. Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC ventilator
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine stable at 1.6 today. Likely from
   hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock but also suspecting some
   component of ATN.  Gentamicin toxicity may also be a cause.
   - hold gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the shock
   and acute bleeds. Still positive overnight despite lasix drip.
   - diurese with lasix for net fluid balance of negative every hour.
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic. Not currently
   written for any rate control medications.
   -Will add beta blocker once pt is absorbing POs again.
   -Monitor HR
 may consider diltiazem IV
   .
   # Anemia: Due to massive GI bleed. Hct currently stable. No bleeds
   since [**6-30**]. Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization after massive GI
   bleeds with likely source being duodenal ulcer.  Patient received 7
   units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - trend CBC daily
   - no blood products as per family wishes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets stable at 60 today.  Patient
s wife has
   agreed to no further blood products, but the overall impression is for
   us not to perform massive transfusion in setting of another massive
   acute bleed.  Patient is NOT comfort measures only, wife only agreed to
   no escalation of care.  By allowing platelets to continue its downward
   trend, it would precipitate the next massive bleeding episode.
   - For now, will transfuse to goal of plt >20 until further goals of
   care are discussed with family.
   - Check PM platelets
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - on TPN with insulin
   - continue ISS

   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture. DDx include
   hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med effect (gancyclovir gives
   transaminitis), progression of GVHD to liver.
   - trend LFTs

   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
 have decreased steroids in effort to help
   ulcer healing
   - cont ppx with atovaquone, ganciclovir & voriconazole, although pt not
   currently getting PO meds due to poor absorption.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who was admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He currently has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock. The patient has several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, bacteremia, and anemia.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is being managed with medications to decrease steroids and treat possible CMV duodenitis, which may have caused the bleeding source. The patient is also being treated for sepsis with an adjusted antibiotic regimen based on ID recommendations. He is on linezolid, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin, with gentamicin levels being monitored and held until below 2.

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with assisted controlled ventilation, and there are plans to wean down as tolerated. The patient's acute renal failure is stable with a creatinine level of 1.6, likely due to hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock and possible ATN. Gentamicin toxicity is also a concern.

The patient has anasarca, which is likely due to receiving a lot of blood products and IV fluids. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance. The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is being managed with amiodarone and other rate/rhythm control methods.

The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 60. The family"

   Assessment and Plan
   61yom refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], and now with
   sepsis and massive GI bleeding.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Continue mechanical ventilator
   support.
   GI BLEED -- severe bleed, attributed to large DU.  No further
   intervention.  No plans for escalation of care, including no massive
   blood products. Plan to wean steroids, continue nutritional support.
   No
   plans for surgery.
   BACTEREMIA -- Continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin
   --> Linezolid and gent for VRE, continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now
   desensitized), Cipro
   ANEMIA -- attributed predominately to GI blood loss.  No further
   escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood
   products.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse to maintain plts >20
   FLUIDS -- total body overloaded due to ressusitation .  Desire net
   negative if tolerates.  Maximally concentrate all iv meds.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   RENAL FAILURE -- monitor creatinine.  At risk for ATN.
   LFT abnormalities -- likely cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.
   SACRAL DECUBITUS ULCER -- Wound care.
   DISPOSITION -- Per discussion with wife, no escalation of care
   (incuding no blood products) and DNR (no CPR).  In the event of
   clinical decline, transition to comfort care.  Continue current level
   of care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], who is now experiencing sepsis and massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has persistent respiratory failure and continues to require mechanical ventilator support. The severe GI bleed is attributed to a large duodenal ulcer and no further intervention is planned. There are no plans for surgery or massive blood product transfusion.

The patient also has bacteremia caused by enterococcus, which is resistant to vancomycin. The treatment involves using linezolid and gentamicin for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and the patient has been desensitized to ciprofloxacin. The anemia is primarily due to GI blood loss, and there will be no escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood products.

Thrombocytopenia is present, and platelet transfusion will be given to maintain platelet count above 20,000. The patient has fluid overload due to resuscitation, and there is a desire for net negative fluid balance if tolerated. Medications will be maximally concentrated. Nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is planned.

Renal failure is monitored with serial creatinine levels, as the patient is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are observed, showing"

   Assessment and Plan
   61yom refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], and now with
   sepsis and massive GI bleeding.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Continue mechanical ventilator
   support.
   GI BLEED -- severe bleed, attributed to large DU.  No further
   intervention.  No plans for escalation of care, including no massive
   blood products. Plan to wean steroids, continue nutritional support.
   No
   plans for surgery.
   BACTEREMIA -- Continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin
   --> Linezolid and gent for VRE, continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now
   desensitized), Cipro
   ANEMIA -- attributed predominately to GI blood loss.  No further
   escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood
   products.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse to maintain plts >20
   FLUIDS -- total body overloaded due to ressusitation .  Desire net
   negative if tolerates.  Maximally concentrate all iv meds.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   RENAL FAILURE -- monitor creatinine.  At risk for ATN.
   LFT abnormalities -- likely cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.
   SACRAL DECUBITUS ULCER -- Wound care.
   DISPOSITION -- Per discussion with wife, no escalation of care
   (incuding no blood products) and DNR (no CPR).  In the event of
   clinical decline, transition to comfort care.  Continue current level
   of care.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], now presenting with sepsis and massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient is currently in respiratory failure and is being mechanically ventilated. The patient's condition is complicated by bacteremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fluid overload, renal failure, liver function test abnormalities, sacral decubitus ulcer, and a do not resuscitate (DNR) order.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and requires continuous mechanical ventilator support. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to worsening respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. There is a risk of progression of sepsis and development of septic shock.

3. GI bleeding: The patient has had a massive GI bleed attributed to a large duodenal ulcer. There is a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing bleeding, which could lead to further blood loss and hemodynamic instability.

4. Anemia: The patient is anemic, primarily due to GI blood loss. If the bleeding continues or recurs, the anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.

5. Thrombocytopenia:"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] with atrial fibrillation with RVR and hemorragic shock due to
   large duodenal ulcer.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Stable. No episdoes of bleeding since [**6-30**] and
   SBP stable in 110s. Due to 8cm bleeding duodenal ulcer, possibly due to
   CMV duodenitis.
   - continue methylprednisone at 10mg qPM and 20mg qAM in effort to
   decrease steroids to assist with ulcer healing
   - continue ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis
   - no pressors, blood products, IR, surgery, chest compressions
   .
   # Sepsis: Resolving. BCx [**6-26**] negative and [**Date range (1) 9544**] still pending. SBP
   stable in 100s. ID following, antibiotic regimen adjusted as per ID
   recommendations
   - Continue Linezolid for VRE as this is known source. Pt will likely
   need prolonged abx course.
   - Meropenem 500mg IV q8h (day 14/14)
 has been adjusted for renal
   function
   - Continue Cipro 400mg IV daily (day [**9-29**]) for pseudomonas in sputum
   and blood
has been adjusted for renal function  -d/w ID possibility of
   stopping this.
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely due to volume overload, decreased
   chest compliance given anasarca. Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC ventilator
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine stable at 1.6 today. Likely from
   hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock but also suspecting some
   component of ATN.  Gentamicin toxicity may also be a cause.
   - hold gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the shock
   and acute bleeds. Still positive overnight despite lasix drip.
   - diurese with lasix for net fluid balance of negative every hour.
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic. Not currently
   written for any rate control medications.
   -Will add beta blocker once pt is absorbing POs again.
   -Monitor HR
 may consider diltiazem IV
   .
   # Anemia: Due to massive GI bleed. Hct currently stable. No bleeds
   since [**6-30**]. Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization after massive GI
   bleeds with likely source being duodenal ulcer.  Patient received 7
   units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - trend CBC daily
   - no blood products as per family wishes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets stable at 60 today.  Patient
s wife has
   agreed to no further blood products, but the overall impression is for
   us not to perform massive transfusion in setting of another massive
   acute bleed.  Patient is NOT comfort measures only, wife only agreed to
   no escalation of care.  By allowing platelets to continue its downward
   trend, it would precipitate the next massive bleeding episode.
   - For now, will transfuse to goal of plt >20 until further goals of
   care are discussed with family.
   - Check PM platelets
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - on TPN with insulin
   - continue ISS
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture. DDx include
   hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med effect (gancyclovir gives
   transaminitis), progression of GVHD to liver.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
 have decreased steroids in effort to help
   ulcer healing
   - cont ppx with atovaquone, ganciclovir & voriconazole, although pt not
   currently getting PO meds due to poor absorption.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Wound care
   .
   # Goals of care:
    -DNR with no pressors, blood products, chest compressions, IR,
   surgery.  No escalation of care.  If/when he starts bleeding again,
   will become comfort measures only with increased pain medication as
   needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] with atrial fibrillation with RVR and hemorragic shock due to
   large duodenal ulcer.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Stable. No episdoes of bleeding since [**6-30**] and
   SBP stable in 110s. Due to 8cm bleeding duodenal ulcer, possibly due to
   CMV duodenitis.
   - continue methylprednisone at 10mg qPM and 20mg qAM in effort to
   decrease steroids to assist with ulcer healing
   - continue ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis
   - no pressors, blood products, IR, surgery, chest compressions
   .
   # Sepsis: Resolving. BCx [**6-26**], [**6-27**], [**6-28**] all negative. SBP stable. ID
   following, antibiotic regimen adjusted as per ID recommendations
   - Continue Linezolid for VRE as this is known source. Pt will likely
   need prolonged abx course.
   - completed 14 day course of Meropenem yesterday for ESBL E. coli in
   his urine
   - Continue Cipro 400mg IV daily (day [**10-29**]) for pseudomonas in sputum
   and blood
has been adjusted for renal function  -d/w ID possibility of
   stopping this.
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely due to volume overload, decreased
   chest compliance given anasarca. Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC ventilator
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine stable at 1.7 today. Likely from
   hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock but also suspecting some
   component of ATN.  Gentamicin toxicity may also be a cause.
   - hold gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the shock
   and acute bleeds. Still positive overnight despite lasix drip.
   - diurese with lasix for net fluid balance of negative every hour.
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic. Not currently
   written for any rate control medications.
   -Will add beta blocker once pt is absorbing POs again.
   -Monitor HR
 may consider diltiazem IV
   .
   # Anemia: Due to massive GI bleed. Hct currently stable. No bleeds
   since [**6-30**]. Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization after massive GI
   bleeds with likely source being duodenal ulcer.  Patient received 7
   units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - trend CBC daily
   - no blood products as per family wishes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets down to 26 this AM.  Patient
s wife has
   agreed to no further blood products, but the overall impression is for
   us not to perform massive transfusion in setting of another massive
   acute bleed.  Patient is NOT comfort measures only, wife only agreed to
   no escalation of care.  By allowing platelets to continue its downward
   trend, it would precipitate the next massive bleeding episode.
   - For now, will transfuse to goal of plt >20 until further goals of
   care are discussed with family.
   - Check PM platelets
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - on TPN with insulin
   - continue ISS
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture. DDx include
   hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med effect (gancyclovir gives
   transaminitis), progression of GVHD to liver.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
 have decreased steroids in effort to help
   ulcer healing
   - cont ppx with atovaquone, ganciclovir & voriconazole, although pt not
   currently getting PO meds due to poor absorption.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Wound care
   .
   # Goals of care:
    -DNR with no pressors, blood products, chest compressions, IR,
   surgery.  No escalation of care.  If/when he starts bleeding again,
   will become comfort measures only with increased pain medication as
   needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hemorrhagic shock due to a large duodenal ulcer. He was admitted on [**2165-2-25**] and has been experiencing various complications since then. The patient has been doing well on assisted ventilation and has stable vital signs. He is still positive for fluid overload, and diuresis goal has not been met. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and immunosuppressants. He has a history of anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's current condition is stable, but he remains at high risk for bleeding and infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient previously experienced hemorrhagic shock due to a large duodenal ulcer. There is a risk of recurrent bleeding, especially with the ongoing use of anticoagulants and immunosuppressive medications. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and adjusting the medication regimen accordingly is important.
2. Sepsis: The patient had a recent episode of sepsis, but currently, his blood cultures are negative. However, due to his immunocompromised state and ongoing use of invasive lines, there is a risk of developing another infection. Regular assessment of vital signs and monitoring of laboratory parameters is necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is most likely due to volume overload and decreased chest compliance given anasarca. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is required, and adjustments in fluid management should be made accordingly.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, but there is a concern for further deterioration in renal function. Holding gentamicin until levels are below 2 and regular monitoring of renal parameters are important.
5. Anasarca: The patient has fluid retention and anasarca. Diuretic therapy should be continued to achieve a negative fluid balance, and electrolyte disturbances should be monitored.
6. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient remains tachycardic, and rate control medications may need to be initiated once the patient is absorbing oral medications again. Monitoring of heart rate and consideration of diltiazem IV should be considered.
7. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are due to massive GI bleeding. Regular monitoring of blood counts and consideration of transfusions based on the patient's goals of care are important.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, and insulin therapy should be continued. Monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to maintain tight glycemic control.
9. LFT abnormalities: The patient has liver function abnormalities, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. Trend"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] with atrial fibrillation with RVR and hemorragic shock due to
   large duodenal ulcer.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Stable. No episdoes of bleeding since [**6-30**] and
   SBP stable in 110s. Due to 8cm bleeding duodenal ulcer, possibly due to
   CMV duodenitis.
   - continue methylprednisone at 10mg qPM and 20mg qAM in effort to
   decrease steroids to assist with ulcer healing
   - continue ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis
   - no pressors, blood products, IR, surgery, chest compressions
   .
   # Sepsis: Resolving. BCx [**6-26**], [**6-27**], [**6-28**] all negative. SBP stable. ID
   following, antibiotic regimen adjusted as per ID recommendations
   - Continue Linezolid for VRE as this is known source. Pt will likely
   need prolonged abx course.
   - completed 14 day course of Meropenem yesterday for ESBL E. coli in
   his urine
   - Continue Cipro 400mg IV daily (day [**10-29**]) for pseudomonas in sputum
   and blood
has been adjusted for renal function  -d/w ID possibility of
   stopping this.
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely due to volume overload, decreased
   chest compliance given anasarca. Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC ventilator
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine stable at 1.7 today. Likely from
   hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock but also suspecting some
   component of ATN.  Gentamicin toxicity may also be a cause.
   - hold gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the shock
   and acute bleeds. Still positive overnight despite lasix drip.
   - diurese with lasix for net fluid balance of negative every hour.
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic. Not currently
   written for any rate control medications.
   -Will add beta blocker once pt is absorbing POs again.
   -Monitor HR
 may consider diltiazem IV
   .
   # Anemia: Due to massive GI bleed. Hct currently stable. No bleeds
   since [**6-30**]. Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization after massive GI
   bleeds with likely source being duodenal ulcer.  Patient received 7
   units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - trend CBC daily
   - no blood products as per family wishes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets down to 26 this AM.  Patient
s wife has
   agreed to no further blood products, but the overall impression is for
   us not to perform massive transfusion in setting of another massive
   acute bleed.  Patient is NOT comfort measures only, wife only agreed to
   no escalation of care.  By allowing platelets to continue its downward
   trend, it would precipitate the next massive bleeding episode.
   - For now, will transfuse to goal of plt >20 until further goals of
   care are discussed with family.
   - Check PM platelets
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - on TPN with insulin
   - continue ISS
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture. DDx include
   hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med effect (gancyclovir gives
   transaminitis), progression of GVHD to liver.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
 have decreased steroids in effort to help
   ulcer healing
   - cont ppx with atovaquone, ganciclovir & voriconazole, although pt not
   currently getting PO meds due to poor absorption.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Wound care
   .
   # Goals of care:
    -DNR with no pressors, blood products, chest compressions, IR,
   surgery.  No escalation of care.  If/when he starts bleeding again,
   will become comfort measures only with increased pain medication as
   needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

- Hemorrhagic shock: The patient had a large duodenal ulcer that led to hemorrhagic shock. He has been stable since [**6-30**], with no further episodes of bleeding. The source of bleeding is suspected to be CMV duodenitis.
- Sepsis: The patient had sepsis, but it is now resolving. Blood cultures from [**6-26**], [**6-27**], and [**6-28**] were negative. Antibiotic regimen has been adjusted based on ID recommendations.
- Respiratory failure: The patient likely has respiratory failure due to volume overload and decreased chest compliance caused by anasarca. He is currently doing well on AC ventilator.
- Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.7. It is believed to be caused by hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock and possibly some component of ATN. Gentamicin toxicity may also be a factor.
- Anasarca: The patient has generalized edema, possibly due to receiving a lot of blood products and IV fluids for shock and acute bleeds. Despite diuresis with Lasix, the patient remains positive overnight.

   Assessment and Plan
   61yom refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], and now with
   sepsis and massive GI bleeding.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial.  Continue
   mechanical ventilator support.  Hope to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial -- main obstacles to extubation include volume overload,
   sedation.
   GI BLEED -- severe bleed, attributed to large DU.  No further
   intervention.  No plans for escalation of care, including no massive
   blood products. Plan to wean steroids, continue nutritional support.
   No plans for surgery.  Continue gancyclovir for possible CMV
   duodenitis.
   BACTEREMIA -- Continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin
   --> Linezolid and gent for VRE, continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now
   desensitized), Cipro
   ANEMIA -- attributed predominately to GI blood loss.  No further
   escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood
   products.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse to maintain plts >20
   FLUIDS -- total body overloaded due to ressusitation .  Desire net
   negative if tolerates.  Maximally concentrate all iv meds.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   GVHD -- continue usual meds.  Now on lower dose steroids.
   RASH -- on hands --> ?sloughing of skin vs active GVHD
   RENAL FAILURE -- monitor creatinine.  At risk for ATN.
   LFT abnormalities -- likely cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.
   SACRAL DECUBITUS ULCER -- Wound care.
   DISPOSITION -- Per discussion with wife, no escalation of care
   (incuding no blood products) and DNR (no CPR).  In the event of
   clinical decline, transition to comfort care.  Continue current level
   of care.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], and now presenting with sepsis and massive gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has persistent respiratory failure, severe gastrointestinal bleed attributed to large duodenal ulcer, bacteremia with enterococcus resistant to vancomycin, anemia due to GI blood loss, thrombocytopenia, fluid overload, and renal failure. There are also abnormalities in liver function tests, sacral decubitus ulcer, and rash on hands.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilator support, and the main obstacles to extubation include volume overload and sedation.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had a severe bleed from a large duodenal ulcer, with no further intervention planned.
3. Bacteremia: The patient continues to have enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin, for which Linezolid and gentamicin have been started.
4. Anemia: This is attributed to GI blood loss, and no further escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood products, is planned.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient requires transfusion to maintain platelet count above 20,000/mL.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has total body overload due to resuscitation efforts. Net negative fluid balance"

   Assessment and Plan
   61yom refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], and now with
   sepsis and massive GI bleeding.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial.  Continue
   mechanical ventilator support.  Hope to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial -- main obstacles to extubation include volume overload,
   sedation.
   GI BLEED -- severe bleed, attributed to large DU.  No further
   intervention.  No plans for escalation of care, including no massive
   blood products. Plan to wean steroids, continue nutritional support.
   No plans for surgery.  Continue gancyclovir for possible CMV
   duodenitis.
   BACTEREMIA -- Continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin
   --> Linezolid and gent for VRE, continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now
   desensitized), Cipro
   ANEMIA -- attributed predominately to GI blood loss.  No further
   escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood
   products.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse to maintain plts >20
   FLUIDS -- total body overloaded due to ressusitation .  Desire net
   negative if tolerates.  Maximally concentrate all iv meds.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   GVHD -- continue usual meds.  Now on lower dose steroids.
   RASH -- on hands --> ?sloughing of skin vs active GVHD
   RENAL FAILURE -- monitor creatinine.  At risk for ATN.
   LFT abnormalities -- likely cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.
   SACRAL DECUBITUS ULCER -- Wound care.
   DISPOSITION -- Per discussion with wife, no escalation of care
   (incuding no blood products) and DNR (no CPR).  In the event of
   clinical decline, transition to comfort care.  Continue current level
   of care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, sepsis, and massive gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to persistent respiratory failure. The main obstacles to extubation include volume overload and sedation.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient experienced a severe bleed attributed to a large duodenal ulcer. No further intervention is planned, and there are no plans for surgery. Nutritional support will be continued, and gancyclovir will be continued for possible cytomegalovirus duodenitis.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. Treatment includes Linezolid and gentamicin for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), along with ciprofloxacin.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is attributed primarily to gastrointestinal blood loss. There will be no escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood products.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count will be managed by transfusion to maintain platelets above 20,000.

6. Fluid Overload: The patient has total body fluid overload due to resuscitation. The goal is to achieve a net negative fluid"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -ID: continue linezolid; if WBC continues to decrease - will change
   back to daptomycin. d/c gancyclovir b/c decreasing WBC correlates with
   time course. will continue linezolid for now b/c VRE not as responsive
   to dapto in past.
   -Hem Onc: If leukopenia worse in AM, d/c gancyclovir; also, change
   linezolid to daptomycin if leukopenia worse; rash on hands not felt to
   be GVHD. Decrease methylprednisone to 10mg IV BID.
   -OGT replaced; in good location
   -Diuresis: approx even at 1800. Increased lasix to 20mg/hr at 2200 ->

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR and hemorrhagic shock due to a large duodenal ulcer, possibly caused by CMV duodenitis. The patient has been doing well on AC (assisted ventilation) and is currently stable. However, he has several ongoing medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient had a massive GI bleed resulting in hemorrhagic shock. Although he is currently stable, there is a concern for another episode of bleeding due to a known duodenal ulcer, possibly caused by CMV duodenitis. The patient is receiving methylprednisolone to aid in ulcer healing and ganciclovir empirically to treat possible CMV duodenitis. Pressors, blood products, IR (interventional radiology), surgery, and chest compressions are not being used.

2. Sepsis: The patient had sepsis, which is now resolving. Blood cultures from [**6-26**], [**6-27**], and [**6-28**] were negative. The antibiotic regimen has been adjusted based on ID (infectious disease) recommendations. Linezolid will be continued for VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus), as this is a known source.

   Assessment and Plan
   61yom refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], and now with
   sepsis and massive GI bleeding.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including volume
   resussitation overload/anasarca, sedation.  Continue mechanical
   ventilator support.  Hope to work towards SBT and extubation trial --
   main obstacles to extubation include volume overload, sedation.  Need
   to discuss possible trach to continue current level of care
   (anticipating prolonged mechanical ventilation).
   GI BLEED -- severe bleed, attributed to large DU.  No further
   intervention.  No plans for escalation of care, including no massive
   blood products. Plan to wean steroids, continue nutritional support.
   No plans for surgery.  Now off gancyclovir, as no evidence for CMV
   infection.
   BACTEREMIA -- Continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin
   --> Linezolid and gent for VRE, continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now
   desensitized), Cipro
   ANEMIA -- attributed predominately to GI blood loss.  No further
   escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood
   products.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse to maintain plts >20
   FLUIDS -- total body overloaded due to ressusitation .  Desire net
   negative if tolerates.  Maximally concentrate all iv meds.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   GVHD -- continue usual meds.  Now on lower dose steroids.
   RASH -- on hands --> ?sloughing of skin vs active GVHD.  Monitor
   RENAL FAILURE -- Continues with good response to lasix.  Monitor
   creatinine.  At risk for ATN.
   LFT abnormalities -- likely cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.
   SACRAL DECUBITUS ULCER -- Wound care.
   DISPOSITION -- Per discussion with wife, no escalation of care
   (incuding no blood products) and DNR (no CPR).  In the event of
   clinical decline, transition to comfort care.  Continue current level
   of care.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], and now presenting with sepsis and massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient's respiratory failure persists due to multifactorial reasons, including volume resuscitation overload/anasarca and sedation. Mechanical ventilator support will continue, and the medical team hopes to work towards a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation trial. However, the main obstacles to extubation include volume overload and sedation. There is also a discussion regarding the possibility of tracheostomy to continue the current level of care, anticipating prolonged mechanical ventilation.

The patient experienced severe GI bleeding attributed to a large duodenal ulcer. No further intervention or plans for escalation of care, including no massive blood product transfusion, will be done. The plan is to wean steroids and continue nutritional support. Surgery is not planned at this time.

The patient has continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin, for which Linezolid and gentamicin for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) will be used. Additionally, the patient has been desensitized to ciprofloxacin.

The patient's anemia is attributed primarily to GI blood loss. No further escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood products, will be done.

   Assessment and Plan
   61yom refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**], and now with
   sepsis and massive GI bleeding.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including volume
   resussitation overload/anasarca, sedation.  Continue mechanical
   ventilator support.  Hope to work towards SBT and extubation trial --
   main obstacles to extubation include volume overload, sedation.  Need
   to discuss possible trach to continue current level of care
   (anticipating prolonged mechanical ventilation).
   GI BLEED -- severe bleed, attributed to large DU.  No further
   intervention.  No plans for escalation of care, including no massive
   blood products. Plan to wean steroids, continue nutritional support.
   No plans for surgery.  Now off gancyclovir, as no evidence for CMV
   infection.
   BACTEREMIA -- Continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin
   --> Linezolid and gent for VRE, continue [**Name (NI) 9261**] (pt now
   desensitized), Cipro
   ANEMIA -- attributed predominately to GI blood loss.  No further
   escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood
   products.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse to maintain plts >20
   FLUIDS -- total body overloaded due to ressusitation .  Desire net
   negative if tolerates.  Maximally concentrate all iv meds.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   GVHD -- continue usual meds.  Now on lower dose steroids.
   RASH -- on hands --> ?sloughing of skin vs active GVHD.  Monitor
   RENAL FAILURE -- Continues with good response to lasix.  Monitor
   creatinine.  At risk for ATN.
   LFT abnormalities -- likely cholestatic picture with transaminitis of
   unclear etiology.
   SACRAL DECUBITUS ULCER -- Wound care.
   DISPOSITION -- Per discussion with wife, no escalation of care
   (incuding no blood products) and DNR (no CPR).  In the event of
   clinical decline, transition to comfort care.  Continue current level
   of care.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   Extensive discussion with wife, updated medical progress and answered
   all questions.  Plan to continue at current level of care.  Remains
   DNR.  Transfusion of blood products OK, but massive transfusion in the
   event of hemodynamically compromising hemorrhage will not be pursued.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma who was admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. The patient now presents with sepsis and massive gastrointestinal bleeding. The main concerns and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, which is multifactorial including volume resuscitation overload/anasarca, sedation. Mechanical ventilator support will continue, and the hope is to work towards a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation trial. However, obstacles to extubation include volume overload and sedation.

2. GI bleeding: The patient has severe gastrointestinal bleeding attributed to a large duodenal ulcer. No further intervention is planned, and there are no plans for escalation of care or surgery. Nutritional support will be continued, and steroids will be weaned.

3. Bacteremia: The patient continues to have enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin. Linezolid and gentamicin for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) will be continued, along with ciprofloxacin.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is attributed predominantly to gastrointestinal blood loss. No further escalation of care, including no massive transfusion with blood products, is planned.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia will be managed by"

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] with atrial fibrillation with RVR and hemorragic shock due to
   large duodenal ulcer.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Patient found to have melenotic stools this
   morning and new blood from OG tube.  Hemodynamics have been stable
   since the finding of new GI bleeding this AM so far.   Likely bleeding
   from the same 8cm duodenal ulcer.  Family notified
   - as per family wishes, no blood products in setting of large GI bleed
   - continue methylprednisone at 10mg [**Hospital1 7**] (decreased from 20/10
   yesterday) in effort to decrease steroids to assist with ulcer healing
   - s/p ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis (stopped
   [**12-17**] lowering WBC count)
   - no pressors, blood products, IR, surgery, chest compressions
   - will check PM CBC and coags if bleeding subsides
   .
   # Sepsis: Resolving. BCx [**6-26**], [**6-27**], [**6-28**] all negative. SBP stable. ID
   following, antibiotic regimen adjusted as per ID recommendations
   - Continue Linezolid for VRE as this is known source. Pt will likely
   need prolonged abx course.
   - Continue Cipro 400mg IV daily (day 13/15) for pseudomonas in sputum
   and blood
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   - completed 14 day course of Meropenem for ESBL E. coli in his urine
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely due to volume overload, decreased
   chest compliance given anasarca. Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC ventilator
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine stable at 1.7 today. Likely from
   hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock but also suspecting some
   component of ATN.  Gentamicin toxicity may also be a cause.
   - hold gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the shock
   and acute bleeds. Finally negative this AM on lasix drip.
   - diurese with lasix for net fluid balance of negative every hour.
   - if not negative, will consider starting diurel to help with diuresis
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic. Not currently
   written for any rate control medications.
   -Will add beta blocker once pt is absorbing POs again.
   -Monitor HR
 may consider diltiazem IV
   .
   # Anemia: Due to massive GI bleed. Hct currently stable. No bleeds
   since [**6-30**]. Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization after massive GI
   bleeds with likely source being duodenal ulcer.  Patient received 7
   units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - trend CBC daily
   - no blood products as per family wishes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets down to 18 this AM (with 1 unit of
   platelets ordered).  Patient
s wife has agreed to no further blood
   products, but the overall impression is for us not to perform massive

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with RVR and hemorrhagic shock due to a large duodenal ulcer. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with increased anasarca and edema. He is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis (resolved), respiratory failure, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's family has made it clear that they do not want blood products to be administered in the setting of large GI bleeding. The patient's goals of care are to provide comfort and avoid any aggressive measures such as pressors, blood transfusions, chest compressions, interventional radiology procedures, or surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient continues to experience gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from the same 8cm duodenal ulcer. The family's decision against blood products may increase the risk of further bleeding episodes.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is still a risk of infection due to his immunocompromised state from multiple myeloma and ongoing immunosuppressive therapy.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload and decreased chest compliance resulting from anasarca. Continued monitoring and management of fluid balance will"

   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] with atrial fibrillation with RVR and hemorragic shock due to
   large duodenal ulcer.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Patient found to have melenotic stools this
   morning and new blood from OG tube.  Hemodynamics have been stable
   since the finding of new GI bleeding this AM so far.   Likely bleeding
   from the same 8cm duodenal ulcer.  Family notified
   - as per family wishes, no blood products in setting of large GI bleed
   - continue methylprednisone at 10mg [**Hospital1 7**] (decreased from 20/10
   yesterday) in effort to decrease steroids to assist with ulcer healing
   - s/p ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis (stopped
   [**12-17**] lowering WBC count)
   - no pressors, blood products, IR, surgery, chest compressions
   - will check PM CBC and coags if bleeding subsides
   .
   # Sepsis: Resolving. BCx [**6-26**], [**6-27**], [**6-28**] all negative. SBP stable. ID
   following, antibiotic regimen adjusted as per ID recommendations
   - Continue Linezolid for VRE as this is known source. Pt will likely
   need prolonged abx course.
   - Continue Cipro 400mg IV daily (day 14/15) for pseudomonas in sputum
   and blood
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   - completed 14 day course of Meropenem for ESBL E. coli in his urine
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely due to volume overload, decreased
   chest compliance given anasarca. Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC ventilator
   - hold lasix drip for now in light of recurrent GI bleed
   - if GI bleed resolves, will continue with plan to diurese
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine trending up to 1.9 today. Likely from
   hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock but also suspecting some
   component of ATN.  Gentamicin toxicity may also be a cause.
   - hold gentamicin until levels <2
   - continue to monitor creatinine
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the shock
   and acute bleeds. Finally negative this AM on lasix drip.
   - hold lasix due to GI bleeding
   - if bleeding resolves, plan to diurese with lasix for net fluid
   balance of negative every hour.
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic. Not currently
   written for any rate control medications.
   -Will add beta blocker once pt is absorbing POs again.
   -Monitor HR
 may consider diltiazem IV
   .
   # Anemia: Due to massive GI bleed. Will follow hct and VS closely today
   because of recurrent GI bleed. Prior to today, pt has not had bleeding
   since [**6-30**]. Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization after massive GI
   bleeds with likely source being duodenal ulcer.  Patient received 7
   units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - no blood products as per family wishes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets at 24 this AM. Patient
s wife has agreed
   to no further blood products, but the overall impression is for us not
   to perform massive transfusion in setting of another massive acute
   bleed.  Patient is NOT comfort measures only, wife only agreed to no
   escalation of care.  By allowing platelets to continue its downward
   trend, it would precipitate the next massive bleeding episode.
   - No platelets today in light of recurrent GI bleed
   - if bleeding resolves, will continue to transfuse to goal of plt >20
   - Check PM platelets
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - on TPN with insulin
   - continue ISS
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture. DDx include
   hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med effect (gancyclovir gives
   transaminitis), progression of GVHD to liver.
   - trend LFTs

   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
 have decreased steroids in effort to help
   ulcer healing
   - cont acyclovir

   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage 3.

   # Goals of care:
    -DNR with no pressors, blood products, chest compressions, IR,

   become comfort measures only with increased pain medication as needed.

The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] with atrial fibrillation, rapid ventricular response, and hemorrhagic shock due to a large duodenal ulcer. The patient has multiple complications including gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, renal failure, respiratory failure, bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's current status shows hemodynamic stability but with ongoing GI bleeding. The family has declined blood products in the setting of large GI bleed. The patient is on methylprednisolone to decrease steroids and assist with ulcer healing, ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis, and antibiotics for sepsis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.9. The patient also has anasarca, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's multiple myeloma course has been complicated, and he is currently in remission post mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The patient's goals of care include do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and no escalation of care."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   61 year old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on
   [**2165-2-25**] with atrial fibrillation with RVR and hemorragic shock due to
   large duodenal ulcer.
   .
   # Hemorrhagic shock:  Stable. No episdoes of bleeding since [**6-30**] and
   SBP stable in 110s. Due to 8cm bleeding duodenal ulcer, possibly due to
   CMV duodenitis.
   - continue methylprednisone at 10mg [**Hospital1 7**] (decreased from 20/10
   yesterday) in effort to decrease steroids to assist with ulcer healing
   - s/p ganciclovir to empirically treat possible CMV duodenitis (stopped
   [**12-17**] lowering WBC count)
   - no pressors, blood products, IR, surgery, chest compressions
   .
   # Sepsis: Resolving. BCx [**6-26**], [**6-27**], [**6-28**] all negative. SBP stable. ID
   following, antibiotic regimen adjusted as per ID recommendations
   - Continue Linezolid for VRE as this is known source. Pt will likely
   need prolonged abx course.
   - Continue Cipro 400mg IV daily (day 13/15) for pseudomonas in sputum
   and blood
   - HOLD gentamicin until levels <2
   - completed 14 day course of Meropenem for ESBL E. coli in his urine
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely due to volume overload, decreased
   chest compliance given anasarca. Pt has been doing well on AC.
   - Continue AC ventilator
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine stable at 1.7 today. Likely from
   hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock but also suspecting some
   component of ATN.  Gentamicin toxicity may also be a cause.
   - hold gentamicin until levels <2
   .
   # Anasarca: Pt received a lot of blood products and IVF for the shock
   and acute bleeds. Finally negative this AM on lasix drip.
   - diurese with lasix for net fluid balance of negative every hour.
   - if not negative, will consider starting diurel to help with diuresis
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic. Not currently
   written for any rate control medications.
   -Will add beta blocker once pt is absorbing POs again.
   -Monitor HR
 may consider diltiazem IV
   .
   # Anemia: Due to massive GI bleed. Hct currently stable. No bleeds
   since [**6-30**]. Pt s/p two IR sessions of embolization after massive GI
   bleeds with likely source being duodenal ulcer.  Patient received 7
   units pRBCs [**6-27**], 2 units [**6-28**], 19 units [**2072-6-28**].
   - trend CBC daily
   - no blood products as per family wishes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets down to 18 this AM (with 1 unit of
   platelets ordered).  Patient
s wife has agreed to no further blood
   products, but the overall impression is for us not to perform massive
   transfusion in setting of another massive acute bleed.  Patient is NOT
   comfort measures only, wife only agreed to no escalation of care.  By
   allowing platelets to continue its downward trend, it would precipitate
   the next massive bleeding episode.
   - For now, will transfuse to goal of plt >20 until further goals of
   care are discussed with family.
   - Check PM platelets
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - on TPN with insulin
   - continue ISS
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: With e/o cholestatic picture. DDx include
   hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, med effect (gancyclovir gives
   transaminitis), progression of GVHD to liver.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma - admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT:
   His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing
   immunosuppression for GVHD.  Per BMT, currently in remission.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants
 have decreased steroids in effort to help
   ulcer healing
   - cont ppx with atovaquone, ganciclovir & voriconazole, although pt not
   currently getting PO meds due to poor absorption.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage 3.
   - Wound care
   .
   # Goals of care:
    -DNR with no pressors, blood products, chest compressions, IR,
   surgery.  No escalation of care.  If he starts bleeding again, will
   become comfort measures only with increased pain medication as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [date] with atrial fibrillation, hemorrhagic shock due to a large duodenal ulcer, and other comorbidities. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a history of large duodenal ulcer, which may lead to recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has developed sacral decubitus ulcer, indicating impaired skin integrity.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has stable creatinine levels at 1.7, suggesting acute renal failure, possibly due to hypotensive episodes during hemorrhagic shock or a component of acute tubular necrosis.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to volume overload and decreased chest compliance caused by anasarca.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection indicated by the previous administration of antibiotics for suspected CMV duodenitis and bacteremia.
6. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient remains tachycardic and has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which needs rate control medication.

Please note that this is a summary and there may be additional information or complexities in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 rebleeding today.
   Plan was to not reintiate massive transfusion protocol if patient were
   to have massive GIB (ie. Hemorrhagic shock)
 we had been transfusing
   with blood products for other parameters.  Lasix gtt stopped.  Family
   called and is now at bedside. Patient appears comfortable and is still
   maintaining pressure.  Plan to transfuse in current clinical setting.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 stage 3 sacral decub
 very impaired
   healing ability given hypoalbuminemia and co-morbidities and relative
   volume overload. Wound care.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 continues to
   worsen. Likely ATN from repeated hypotensive episodes with each bleed
   and massive transfusions. Could have also been secondary to gent
   toxicity. Urine output good on lasix gtt, but holding for now given
   bleed.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 difficult to wean given
   massive volume overload. We were attempting to diurese to optimize
   respiratory mechanics. No evidence of active infection at this time.
   Can restart if bleeding stops.
 BACTEREMIA
 no further positive blood cultures. Approaching end of
   antibiotic course. Remains afebrile.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 very difficult to rate control. Monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a complicated multiple myeloma patient who has undergone one failed bone marrow transplant (BMT) and one successful allogeneic BMT. They have been admitted to the hospital for over 120 days, with six admissions in total. The patient's current condition includes gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), respiratory failure, massive volume overload, resolving septic shock, and atrial fibrillation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient is experiencing recurrent GIB, which has resulted in significant blood loss. This can lead to hemorrhagic shock and may require massive transfusions.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to massive volume overload. This can make it difficult to wean off mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening renal failure, possibly due to repeated hypotensive episodes and massive transfusions. This can further complicate the management of the patient's condition.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a stage 3 sacral decubitus ulcer, indicating impaired healing ability. This is likely due to hypoalbuminemia, co-morbidities, and relative volume overload.
5. Bacteremia: Although the patient's blood cultures are now negative, there is a history of bacteremia, which can increase the risk of infections.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has very difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation"

","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient experienced a massive gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) this morning, which has resulted in hematemesis and melena. The patient's vital signs are stable at present. 

The patient has several allergies, including penicillins causing anaphylaxis, morphine causing nausea and vomiting, and meropenem with unknown allergic reaction. 

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, fentanyl, midazolam, and others. They are also receiving TPN with lipids, insulin for glycemic control, and multiple IV fluids.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent GIB. The patient's flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid administration and output, as well as respiratory support through mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances and elevated levels of lactate and troponin T.

The patient's assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 rebleeding today.
   Plan was to not reintiate massive transfusion protocol if patient were
   to have massive GIB
 we had been transfusing with blood products for
   other parameters up until today. Lasix gtt stopped. Family called and
   is now at bedside. Patient appears comfortable and is still maintaining
   pressure. We will gear our efforts towards comfort if he continues to
   bleed out.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 stage 3 sacral decub
 very impaired
   healing ability given hypoalbuminemia and co-morbidities and relative
   volume overload. Wound care.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 continues to
   worsen. Likely ATN from repeated hypotensive episodes with each bleed
   and massive transfusions. Could have also been secondary to gent
   toxicity. Urine output good on lasix gtt, but holding for now given
   bleed.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 difficult to wean given
   massive volume overload. We were attempting to diurese to optimize
   respiratory mechanics. No evidence of active infection at this time.
   Can restart if bleeding stops.
 BACTEREMIA
 no further positive blood cultures. Approaching end of
   antibiotic course. Remains afebrile.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 very difficult to rate control. Monitor
   on tele.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a complicated multiple myeloma patient who has been admitted to the ICU for over 120 days with six hospital admissions. The patient has a history of graft-versus-host disease, bacteremia with septic shock, and four massive gastrointestinal bleeds. The patient's current chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), respiratory failure, and massive volume overload, which is resolving septic shock.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/62 mmHg to 139/136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient has been intubated and sedated, with movements to tactile stimuli. Physical examination findings include hematemesis draining from the orogastric tube, melena from the bottom, massive anasarca, and diffuse expiratory wheezing and palpable rhonchi in the lungs. The abdomen is described as obese with no bowel sounds.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 24,000 K/uL, platelet count of 60,000/mm3, creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 113 mg/dL, sodium level of 119 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride level of 25.3%, and magnesium level of 1.3 K/uL. Other lab values are also provided, including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, elevated lactate acid level, and elevated levels of liver enzymes and lipase.

The patient's assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleeding, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, bacteremia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is on various medications such as pantoprazole, fentanyl, midazolam, lasix, carafate, mycophenolate, chlorhexidine, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, and protonix.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to massive volume overload, further gastrointestinal bleeding, progression of acute renal failure, and complications related to impaired skin integrity."
