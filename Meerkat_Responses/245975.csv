","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone procedures such as dual antiplatelet stenting of the right internal carotid artery (RICA) and left ICA stent. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing difficulty weaning off life support.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 53 bpm with sinus bradycardia, blood pressure ranging from 97/52 to 80/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving phenylephrine infusion to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention, carotid bruits bilaterally, a soft systolic murmur at the upper sternal border, enlarged anteroposterior diameter of the lungs, and no peripheral edema or femoral bruits. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves, normal strength in the upper and lower extremities, and equal sensory exam bilaterally.

Laboratory results indicate leukocyte count of 10.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 27.6%, platelet count of 296 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for carotid stenosis. The patient tolerated the procedure well but required phenylephrine post-operatively due to low blood pressure in the 70s. The patient is currently in the ICU and unable to wean off the ventilator. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/52-80/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals a well-appearing male with no acute distress, oriented and with appropriate mood and affect. There are no carotid bruits or femoral bruits noted. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves and normal strength in both upper and lower extremities. The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated white blood cell count of 10.8 K/uL. The patient's medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and others as per the plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is unable to wean off the ventilator, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo male with h/o CAD s/p DES to RCA, R ICA stent, L ICA stenosis s/p
   L ICA stent.
   .
   #Carotid Stenosis-  now s/p PCI, pt tolerated procedure well. Requiring
   Phenylephrine post op due to SBP in 70s.  Thought to be [**2-12**] vagal
   stimulation from stent.
   -q4 neuro checks
   -Maintain SBP 100-160 using Phenylephrine.  Will attempt to wean as
   tolerated.  Encourage ambulation.
   -asa, plavix, statin
   - will check lipids
   -Neuro has evaluated pt, no neurologic deficits appreciated post
   procedure.
   .
   # CAD: Continue aspirin, plavix, statin. Holding BB, ACE pending BP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, telemetry
   .
   # BPH- Hold flomax pending BP, continue finasteride
   .
   # GERD- Continue home PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for carotid stenosis. The patient tolerated the procedure well but required Phenylephrine post-op due to low blood pressure in the 70s, which was thought to be vagal stimulation from the stent.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/55 mmHg to 126/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and well-hydrated. His lungs are clear, and his abdomen is soft with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. His extremities have good pulses, and his neurologic exam is normal.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 121 mg/dL. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium at 3.4 mEq/L. The patient's renal function is normal, with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL.

The patient has several medications"
