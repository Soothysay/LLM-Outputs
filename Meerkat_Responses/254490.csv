   67 yo man with extensive disease of the Left Main and LCx and
   restenosis of the LAD despite 2x PCI with stenting of distal LAD
   lesion, as well as a totally occluded RCA, and ESRD s/p renal
   transplant, here with STEMI.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Extensive stenosis in LM/LAD/LCx including restenosis in
   distal LAD, s/p balloon angioplasty today. IABP inserted for support of
   coronary diastolic perfusion. Per surgery, will plan on 5x bypass
   surgery on [**5-18**], giving time for plavix level to decline from dose in
   ED. Will remain on integrillin until surgery but D/C plavix. Echo
   scheduled for tomorrow.
   - Continue ASA, beta-blocker, atorvastatin, lisinopril
   - Echo tomorrow
   - Repeat EKG
   - Anticoagulation with integrillin.
   - follow tele for PVCs or onset of arrhythmia and treat as necessary
   - Nitro drip as needed for CP
   - Monitor BPs and treat as necessary.
   - Maintain IABP at 1:1 until CABG.
   .
   # PUMP: History of Systolic CHF, with an EF of 35%. Currently takes
   Metoprolol, Lasix, and Lisinopril at home. Will continue beta-blocker,
   diuresis and ACE-I, and will re-evaluate pump function after STEMI with
   echo.
   - Presently appears euvolemic; continue home dose of lasix and
   maintenance fluids. Follow daily Is/Os.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR so far but h/o AF with RVR s/p cardioversion, still on
   Coumadin daily at home.
   - d/c coumadin (INR=2), maintain anticoagulation with integrillin.
   - Continue rate control with metoprolol
   - Follow rhythm on tele
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:  The patient has a history of DM2,
   for which he takes a RISS and Glipizide daily. Continued RISS
   and Glipizide
   - daily FSBG, insulin per SSI
   .
   # s/p renal transplant:
   - Renal Function: Concern for ARF due to likely renal hypoperfusion in
   setting of STEMI. Admission labs show Cre 1.7, which is within the
   1.2-1.8 range of his measured creatinines this year. Will follow
   BUN/Cre and UOP for signs of ARF.
   - Immunosuppression: We will continue him on his tacrolimus and his
   prednisone at his current dose. Will inform transplant team of his
   admission.
   - PTH: We will continue him on his calcitriol and sensipar.
   - Erythropoiesis: Low Hct=32.9 on admission, likely related to
   procedure and IABP placement and will likely recover; will trend Hct
   and consider erythropogenic agents if necessary.
   .
   # Recent Fall: Large L thigh ecchymosis, c/f further bleeding in
   setting of integrellin. Outlined borders on admission, will monitor for
   changes. Will monitor pain and control with APAP and fentanyl as
   needed. No need for plain film at this time as pt was comfortable at
   home and walking on his legs.
   - Monitor thight girth for signs of expanding hematoma
   .
   # Gout: The patient has a history of gout, for which he takes
   Allopurinol. Continue allopurinol 150mg daily.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia,
   for which he takes Atorvastatin. Continue atorvastatin at 80 mg PO
   daily.
   .
   # Spinal Stenosis:  The patient has a history of spinal
   stenosis, for which he takes Oxycodone q6h prn, which we will continue
   here as appropriate.
   .
   # Sciatica.  On chronic fentanyl therapy at home. Will continue here.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with extensive disease of the left main and LCx arteries, as well as restenosis in the LAD artery. He underwent balloon angioplasty today. The patient also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-renal transplant and presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 136/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. He is receiving eptifibatide and heparin infusions.

Physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, and unassessed skin and neurologic status.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, mildly elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and troponin-T levels. The patient's electrolytes and other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes systolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, type 2 diabetes mellitus, renal transplant, spinal stenosis, gout, hyperlipidemia, and sciatica. He is currently taking multiple medications for his conditions.

Plan:
The patient will remain on integrillin until surgery, at which point it will be discontinued"

   67 yo man with extensive disease of the Left Main and LCx and
   restenosis of the LAD despite 2x PCI with stenting of distal LAD
   lesion, as well as a totally occluded RCA, and ESRD s/p renal
   transplant, here with STEMI.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Extensive stenosis in LM/LAD/LCx including restenosis in
   distal LAD, s/p balloon angioplasty. IABP inserted for support of
   coronary diastolic perfusion. Per CT surgery, will plan on 5x bypass
   surgery on [**5-18**], giving time for plavix level to decline from dose in
   ED. Will remain on integrillin until surgery but D/C plavix..
   - plan for CT surgery tomorrow (NPO after midnight)
   - Continue ASA, beta-blocker, atorvastatin, lisinopril
   - f/u Echo and CXR
   - Repeat EKG
   - Anticoagulation with integrillin and heparin
   - follow tele for PVCs or onset of arrhythmia and treat as necessary
   - Nitro drip as needed for CP
   - Monitor BPs and treat as necessary.
   - Maintain IABP at 1:1 until CABG.
   .
   # PUMP: History of Systolic CHF, with an EF of 35%. Currently takes
   Metoprolol, Lasix, and Lisinopril at home. Will continue beta-blocker,
   diuresis and ACE-I, and will re-evaluate pump function after STEMI with
   echo.
   - currently euvolemic; continue home dose of lasix and maintenance
   fluids. Follow daily Is/Os.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR so far but h/o AF with RVR s/p cardioversion, still on
   Coumadin daily at home.
   - d/c coumadin (INR=2), maintain anticoagulation with integrillin.
   - Continue rate control with metoprolol
   - Follow rhythm on tele
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt with Hct of 32 on admission and drop to 26.8 today.  Pt
   s/pngioplasty.  He also had a fall with left thigh ecchymosis.  No
   active sings of bleeding, but he is on anti-cogulation.  Concern for
   hematoma in thigh (either from fall or from cath site, although
   currently stable on exam)
   - monitor q8 Hct
   - CT abd/pelvis for eval fo RP bleed.
   - T&S
   - will transfuse 2U pRBC
   - check post-transfusion Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:  The patient has a history of DM2,
   for which he takes a RISS and Glipizide daily. Continued RISS
   and Glipizide
   - daily FSBG, insulin per SSI
   .
   # s/p renal transplant:
   - Renal Function: Concern for ARF due to likely renal hypoperfusion in
   setting of STEMI. Admission labs show Cre 1.7, which is within the
   1.2-1.8 range of his measured creatinines this year. Currently trending
   down. Will monitor Cr/BUN and UOP for signs of ARF.
   - Immunosuppression: We will continue him on his tacrolimus and his
   prednisone at his current dose.
      -will alert transplant team that patient is in house.
   - PTH: We will continue him on his calcitriol and sensipar.
   - Erythropoiesis: Low Hct=32.9 on admission, likely related to
   procedure and IABP placement and will likely recover; will trend Hct
   and consider erythropogenic agents if necessary.
   .
   # Recent Fall: Large L thigh ecchymosis, c/f further bleeding in
   setting of integrellin. See above management for anemia. Outlined
   borders on admission, will monitor for changes. Will monitor pain and
   control with APAP and fentanyl as needed. No need for plain film at
   this time as pt was comfortable at home and walking on his legs.
   - anemia workup as above
   - Monitor thigh girth for signs of expanding hematoma
   .
   # Gout: The patient has a history of gout, for which he takes
   Allopurinol. Continue allopurinol 150mg daily.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia,
   for which he takes Atorvastatin. Continue atorvastatin at 80 mg PO
   daily.
   .
   # Spinal Stenosis:  The patient has a history of spinal
   stenosis, for which he takes Oxycodone q6h prn, which we will continue
   here as appropriate.
   .
   # Sciatica.  On chronic fentanyl therapy at home. Will continue here.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with extensive coronary artery disease and end-stage renal disease post renal transplant, presenting with STEMI. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting but has restenosis in the distal LAD and a totally occluded RCA. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted for support of coronary diastolic perfusion. The patient is scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on [**5-18**]. The patient has a history of systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 35%, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gout, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, and sciatica. The patient is anemic with a Hct drop from 32.9 to 26.8, likely related to the procedure and IABP placement. There is concern for hematoma in the left thigh due to a fall or catheter site, although currently stable on exam. The patient is on anticoagulation with integrillin and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped significantly from 32.9 to 26.8, indicating anemia. This may be related to the procedure and IABP placement. Monitoring of Hct levels, consideration of erythropoietic agents, and transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of renal transplant, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperparathyroidism, hypertension, and bone marrow transplant. He presented with acute coronary syndrome and was found to have mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anteroseptum akinesis and severe hypokinesis of the distal 12-17 of the ventricle. His left ventricular ejection fraction is 40%. He also has a history of allergies to penicillins and iodine.

24-hour events include a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 32.9% to 26.8%, for which he received 2 units of packed red blood cells. His Hct increased to 32.4 after the transfusion. CT scans of the abdomen/pelvis and head showed no signs of bleeding or acute processes. He is being treated with tacrolimus (tac) and prednisone, with a goal range of 3-20 ng/mL for tacrolimus. His current tacrolimus level is 2.7, and his renal specialist plans to adjust the dose and recheck the level in the morning. A carotid ultrasound showed less than 40% stenosis bilaterally. An echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and regional systolic dysfunction consistent with mid LAD disease.

The patient's allergies include penicillins,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of renal transplant, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, gout, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis/sciatica, and hypomaniasis. The patient presented with anemia, epistaxis, and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) but experienced a further drop in hemoglobin from 32.4% to 30.3%. The patient's renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 1.5. Tacrolimus levels are low and will be monitored. The patient's ejection fraction (LVEF) improved from 35% to 40% according to the latest echocardiogram. He has mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anteroseptum akinesis and severe hypokinesis of the distal 12-17 of the ventricle. The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable with a reading of 116/27 mmHg. He is currently on eptifibatide, heparin, omeprazole, and fentanyl. The patient's wounds are healing well without any signs of infection. He is scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery tomorrow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, there are several significant events that have occurred within the past 24 hours.

Firstly, the patient experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 32.9 to 26.8, which prompted a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Despite the transfusion, the Hct level remains at 32.4.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no signs of retroperitoneal bleeding, while a CT scan of the head revealed no acute processes. The patient's renal transplant is being managed with tacrolimus (Tac) and prednisone, with a goal Tac level between 3-20.

Carotid ultrasound results indicate less than 40% stenosis on both sides. An echocardiogram (ECHO) showed mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, along with akinesis in the mid to distal anteroseptum and severe hypokinesis of the distal 12-17 of the ventricle. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated at 40%. There is also mild left ventricular hypertrophy and regional systolic dysfunction consistent with mid left anterior descending (LAD) disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of renal transplantation, diabetes mellitus type 2, gout, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis/sciatica, and a fall with leg ecchymosis. The patient presented to the ICU with acute coronary syndrome, resulting in an inferior wall myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient was successfully resuscitated and intubated.

Overnight, the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding, and a CT scan of the head revealed no acute processes. The patient's renal function remains stable with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL.

The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, and he is hemodynamically stable. However, there is concern for left ventricular dysfunction as indicated by the echocardiogram showing mild to moderate regional systolic dysfunction and akinesis in the mid-distal anteroseptum. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reported at 40%.

The patient continues to experience episodes of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT), but remains in sinus rhythm. The patient's coagulation profile is improving, and the International Normalized"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with a chief complaint of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an unstable angina episode. The patient has a history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, renal transplant, and bone marrow transplant. They also have hyperparathyroidism and allergies to penicillins and iodine.

24-hour events include a drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 32.9 to 26.8, which led to the administration of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), resulting in a post-transfusion Hct of 32.4. CT scans of the abdomen/pelvis and head showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed or acute processes, respectively. The patient's renal transplant is being managed with tacrolimus (Tac) and prednisone, with a target Tac level of 3-20 ng/mL. The current Tac level is 2.7, and the renal recipient will follow up with a recheck level in the morning. A carotid ultrasound revealed less than 40% stenosis bilaterally. An echocardiogram demonstrated mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mid to distal anteroseptum akinesis, severe hypokinesis of the distal 12-17 of the ventricle, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%, and mild left ventricular hypertrophy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of epistaxis (nosebleed) and is currently in the ICU. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including the discontinuation of integrillin, continuous heparin infusion, and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The ENT consultant recommended saline nasal spray, bacitracin, humidifying shovel mask, and afrin for any bleeding episodes. The patient's Hct level is 30, and no transfusion was given. The patient's renal function is monitored, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. The patient's INR is 1.7, and an additional dose of vitamin K was administered. The patient is scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: Despite the resolution of epistaxis, there is still a risk of further bleeding due to the patient's low platelet count and ongoing use of anticoagulant medications.
2. Infection: The presence of an IABP line and the use of antibiotics for stress ulcers increase the risk of infection, particularly in the bloodstream or lungs.
3. Renal impairment: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates potential renal dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure readings show fluctuations, indicating the need for close"
