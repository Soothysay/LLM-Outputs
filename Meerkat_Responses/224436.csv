   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: The patient is a 28 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse,
   necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures, who
   presents from rehab facility with anemia, fevers, and hypotension,
   concerning for an acute bleed.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt was given 2 [**Location 392**] yesterday, and his Hct did not
   bump appropriately.  CT-abdomen prelim did not show any evidence of
   bleeding.  Hemolysis labs are currently pending.  DDx includes acute
   bleed (GI v. retroperitoneal v. bleeding into pseudocysts) v.
   hemolysis.
    - F/U Tbili, haptoglobin, LDH to evaluate for hemolysis
    - F/U Fe studies, B12, and folate
    - Transfuse one U now of PRBCs
    - F/U final CT-abdomen read
   .
   # Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive upon arrival the the ICU
   this evening, and he was reportedly hypotensive at [**Hospital 25**] rehab.  He
   has been given 500 cc NS each hour in order to obtain 50 cc UOP/h.
    - NS continuously at 500 cc/h until UOP increases to 50 cc/h
   .
   # Fevers:  The patient has had persistent fevers for the past three
   days, accompanied with an increasing leukocytosis.  Blood cultures at
   rehab were negative to date.  DDx includes infection v. central process
   v. intra-abdominal hematoma.
    - Hold on antibiotics for now, as patient's blood cultures have been
   negative.  If needed, may restart Tobramycin and Ceftax (may be abx
   failure)
    - IVFs for insensible losses
    - F/U abdominal CT for possible hematoma.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Sugars on arrival were 307.
    - Continue HISS and FSBG qid
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Continue vitamin D twice weekly for 3 more weeks and
   then recheck Ca and Vit D levels.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: He was recently started on Levothyroxine, and his
   dose was increased to 50 mcg daily.
    - Continue Levoxyl 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis
   complicated by known necrosis and pseudocytst.  His lipase was elevated
   at [**Hospital3 **], and most recent CT scan showed enlargement of
   pseudocysts.
    - Recheck amylase/lipase tomorrow
    - F/U abdominal U/S
   .
   # Nutrition:  Continue with concentrated TFs.
   .
   # FEN:
    - IVFs at 500 cc/h to UOP goal of 50 cc/h
    - Replete electrolytes

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of ethanol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He presents with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, which are concerning for an acute bleed. The assessment includes anemia, hypotension, and fevers. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute bleed: There is a possibility of gastrointestinal, retroperitoneal, or bleeding into pseudocysts. This could be due to ongoing bleeding from the pancreas or other sources.
2. Hemolysis: The patient's hemoglobin level did not improve with blood transfusion, and hemolysis labs are pending. This could indicate intravascular hemolysis, possibly related to blood transfusion or another underlying cause.
3. Infection: The patient has had persistent fevers for the past three days, along with increasing leukocytosis. Blood cultures were negative, but there is still a possibility of infection, including central line-associated bloodstream infection or intra-abdominal infection.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocysts. Enlargement of pseudocysts on recent CT scan suggests ongoing complications related to pancreatitis.

Overall, the patient's condition is unstable, and close monitoring and management are required to address these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He presents with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed. The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but his hemoglobin concentration did not improve, indicating a potential ongoing bleed or hemolysis. The patient's blood cultures have been negative, and he is being given intravenous fluids (NS) to maintain urine output at 50 cc/h. The patient's recent CT scan showed enlargement of pseudocysts related to his history of pancreatitis. He also has hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, and requires nutrition support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute bleed: The patient may be experiencing an acute bleed, either from the gastrointestinal tract, retroperitoneal area, or bleeding into pseudocysts. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of bleeding.
2. Hemolysis: The patient's anemia did not improve despite receiving PRBCs, suggesting the possibility of hemolysis. Hemolysis labs are pending to evaluate this condition.
3. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers and increasing leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection. Blood cultures have been negative so far, but further evaluation is needed.
4. Pancreatitis complications: The patient has a history of"

   fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed.
   # Posterior thigh hematomas: Pt was given 3 [**Location 392**] with hct change
   from 20 -> 24, now stable.  Initial concern for acute bleed from GI v.
   retroperitoneal v. bleeding into pseudocysts v. hemolysis but now clear
   that bleeding is secondary to posterior thigh hematomas in setting of
   lovenox.  No evidence of compartment syndrome though patient unable to
   answer questions related to paresthesias; DP pulses good.
   - monitor hct q8h
   - transfuse for Hct > 21
   - ortho aware of patient but will not consult at this time given
   stabilization of hct and thigh tautness
   - will not restart lovenox
   # Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive upon arrival the the ICU,
   and he was reportedly hypotensive at [**Hospital 25**] rehab.  He was given 500
   cc NS each hour in order to obtain 50 cc UOP/h, but boluses now stopped
   with stable BP.
   - continue to follow BPs
   - LR boluses if needed given hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
   # Fevers:  The patient has had persistent fevers for the past four
   days, accompanied with an increasing leukocytosis.  Blood cultures at
   rehab were negative to date.  DDx includes infection v. central
   process.  Also with urethral discharge.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now, as patient's blood cultures have been
   negative.  If needed, may restart Tobramycin and Ceftax (may be abx
   failure)
   - IVFs prn for insensible losses
   - f/u cx data from [**Hospital1 25**]

   # Chronic respiratory failure:  was on and off pressure support and has
   been doing well with trach mask.  Has baseline episodes of tachypnea,
   likely related to pain vs fever vs anxiety.
   - continue trach mask
   - continue fentanly boluses for pain
   - APAP and cooling blanket for fever
   # Hyperglycemia:  Sugars on arrival were 307.
    - Continue HISS and FSBG qid
   # Hypercalcemia: Continue vitamin D twice weekly for 3 more weeks and
   then recheck Ca and Vit D levels.
   # Hypothyroidism: He was recently started on Levothyroxine, and his
   dose was increased to 50 mcg daily.
    - Continue Levoxyl 50 mcg daily

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Infection: The patient has had persistent fevers for the past four days, accompanied by increasing leukocytosis. Blood cultures at rehab were negative to date. The differential diagnosis includes infection versus central process. The presence of purulent urethral discharge also raises concern for a possible urinary tract infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was on and off pressure support and has been doing well with a tracheostomy mask. However, there are baseline episodes of tachypnea, likely related to pain, fever, or anxiety. Continuous monitoring and management of respiratory function is crucial to prevent further complications.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis complicated by known necrosis and pseudocysts. His lipase levels were elevated at [**Hospital3 **], and recent imaging showed enlargement of the pseudocysts. Close monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and follow-up imaging studies are necessary to assess the progression of pancreatitis and potential complications.

4. Thrombosis: The patient was given Lovenox, a form of low molecular weight heparin, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The presence of posterior thigh hematomas suggests a possible complication related to the use of Lovenox. Continuous monitoring of hematocrit levels and assessment for signs of bleeding or thrombosis are important.

5. Hypotension: The patient was"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He presents with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, which is concerning for an acute bleed. The patient has been diagnosed with posterior thigh hematomas and is currently stable with a hematocrit (Hct) change from 20 to 24. The initial concern was acute bleed from gastrointestinal (GI) or retroperitoneal bleeding into pseudocysts or hemolysis. However, it is now clear that the bleeding is secondary to the posterior thigh hematomas in the setting of Lovenox (lovenox is a medication). There is no evidence of compartment syndrome, although the patient is unable to answer questions related to paresthesias; distal pulses (DP) are good.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from the provided information:

1. Thigh hematomas: The patient has developed posterior thigh hematomas, which may require further evaluation and management to prevent any complications such as infection or additional bleeding.

2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive upon arrival at the ICU and had been reportedly hypotensive at the rehab facility. He received normal saline (NS) boluses to maintain adequate urine output but is now stable. Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential to prevent hypoperfusion and organ damage.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain
   injury, and seizures, who presents from rehab facility with anemia,
   fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed.
   # Posterior thigh hematomas: Pt was given 3 [**Location 392**] with hct change
   from 20 -> 24, now stable.  Initial concern for acute bleed from GI v.
   retroperitoneal v. bleeding into pseudocysts v. hemolysis but now clear
   that bleeding is secondary to posterior thigh hematomas in setting of
   lovenox.  No evidence of compartment syndrome though patient unable to
   answer questions related to paresthesias; DP pulses good.
   - monitor hct q8h
   - transfuse for Hct > 21
   - ortho aware of patient but will not consult at this time given
   stabilization of hct and thigh tautness
   - will not restart lovenox
   # Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive upon arrival the the ICU,
   and he was reportedly hypotensive at [**Hospital 25**] rehab.  He was given 500
   cc NS each hour in order to obtain 50 cc UOP/h, but boluses now stopped
   with stable BP.
   - continue to follow BPs
   - LR boluses if needed given hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
   # Fevers:  The patient has had persistent fevers for the past four
   days, accompanied with an increasing leukocytosis.  Blood cultures at
   rehab were negative to date.  DDx includes infection v. central
   process.  Also with urethral discharge.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now, as patient's blood cultures have been
   negative.  If needed, may restart Tobramycin and Ceftax (may be abx
   failure)
   - IVFs prn for insensible losses
   - f/u cx data from [**Hospital1 25**]
   - f/u urine cx, GC/chlamydia/herpes
   - stool studies pending
   # Chronic respiratory failure:  was on and off pressure support and has
   been doing well with trach mask.  Has baseline episodes of tachypnea,
   likely related to pain vs fever vs anxiety.
   - continue trach mask
   - continue fentanly boluses for pain
   - APAP and cooling blanket for fever
   # Hyperglycemia:  Sugars on arrival were 307.
    - Continue HISS and FSBG qid
   # Hypercalcemia: Continue vitamin D twice weekly for 3 more weeks and
   then recheck Ca and Vit D levels.
   # Hypothyroidism: He was recently started on Levothyroxine, and his
   dose was increased to 50 mcg daily.
    - Continue Levoxyl 50 mcg daily
   # Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis
   complicated by known necrosis and pseudocytst.  His lipase was elevated
   at [**Hospital3 **], and most recent CT scan showed enlargement of
   pseudocysts.
    - Recheck amylase/lipase tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He presented with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including hypotension, fevers, anemia, chronic respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, and pancreatitis. He is currently on various medications and treatments in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's initial concern was an acute bleed, which was later determined to be secondary to posterior thigh hematomas caused by Lovenox. There is a risk of further bleeding complications, especially if the patient's hematocrit levels drop below 21.
2. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers and increasing leukocytosis, suggesting a possible infection. Blood cultures have been negative so far, but there is a possibility of developing a central or respiratory process, especially given the presence of purulent urethral discharge.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis with necrosis and pseudocysts. His lipase levels were elevated at the previous hospital, and recent CT scans showed enlargement of the pseudocysts. Monitoring amylase/lipase levels and follow-up abdominal ultrasound are planned.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and requires"

","The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of ethanol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He presents to the ICU with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed. The patient has had posterior thigh hematomas, which have been treated with transfusions. His hypotension is attributed to blood loss, and his blood pressure has been stable after stopping fluid boluses. He has persistent fevers for the past four days accompanied by increasing leukocytosis, most likely a central process. Blood cultures at rehab were negative. The patient also has chronic respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, hypothyroidism, and a history of severe pancreatitis complicated by known necrosis and pseudocyst. His lipase levels were elevated at another hospital, and his most recent CT scan showed enlargement of pseudocysts. The patient is currently on multiple medications including fentanyl for pain management, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. He has a PICC line and one PIV line. The patient is receiving nutritional support through NovaSource Renal (Full) at 30 mL/hour and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. His code status is full code, and his disposition is pending further evaluation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He presents with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed. The patient has been diagnosed with posterior thigh hematomas, which were initially thought to be caused by acute bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or retroperitoneal vein bleeding into pseudocysts or hemolysis. However, it is now clear that the bleeding is secondary to the posterior thigh hematomas in the setting of Lovenox (lovenox-induced bleeding). There are no signs of compartment syndrome, but the patient's hct (hematocrit) has stabilized at 24%. 

The patient was hypotensive upon arrival in the ICU and had received NS (normal saline) boluses to maintain a stable blood pressure. His fever has persisted for four days, accompanied by increasing leukocytosis. Blood cultures at the rehab facility were negative. The differential diagnosis includes infection versus central process. The patient has a history of necrotizing pancreatitis and known pseudocysts, which may be contributing to his chronic respiratory failure. 

Other medical issues include hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including fentanyl boluses for pain, APAP (acetaminophen) and a cooling blanket for fever, HISS"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He was admitted to the ICU with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, which raised concerns for an acute bleed. The patient has since been stabilized, and the cause of bleeding has been identified as posterior thigh hematomas in the setting of Lovenox therapy. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/78 to 142/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.5 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level of 22.2 g/dL, platelet count of 569 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 158 mg/dL, and elevated levels of lactic acid and LDH. 

The patient's medical history includes necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, seizures, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, and previous hospitalizations for these conditions. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Posterior thigh hematomas: The patient received three units of packed red blood cells with an improvement in hemoglobin level from 20 to "

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain
   injury, and seizures, who presents from rehab facility with anemia,
   fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed.
   # Posterior thigh hematomas: Pt was given 3 [**Location 392**] with hct change
   from 20 -> 24, now stable.  Initial concern for acute bleed from GI v.
   retroperitoneal v. bleeding into pseudocysts v. hemolysis but now clear
   that bleeding is secondary to posterior thigh hematomas in setting of
   lovenox.  No evidence of compartment syndrome though patient unable to
   answer questions related to paresthesias; DP pulses good.
   - monitor hct q8h
   - transfuse for Hct > 21
   - ortho aware of patient but will not consult at this time given
   stabilization of hct and thigh tautness
   - will not restart lovenox
   # Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive upon arrival the the ICU,
   and he was reportedly hypotensive at [**Hospital 25**] rehab.  He was given 500
   cc NS each hour in order to obtain 50 cc UOP/h, but boluses now stopped
   with stable BP.
   - continue to follow BPs
   - LR boluses if needed given hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
   # Fevers:  The patient has had persistent fevers for the past four
   days, accompanied with an increasing leukocytosis.  Blood cultures at
   rehab were negative to date.  DDx includes infection v. central
   process.  Also with urethral discharge.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now, as patient's blood cultures have been
   negative.  If needed, may restart Tobramycin and Ceftax (may be abx
   failure)
   - IVFs prn for insensible losses
   - f/u cx data from [**Hospital1 25**]
   - f/u urine cx, GC/chlamydia/herpes
   - stool studies pending
   # Chronic respiratory failure:  was on and off pressure support and has
   been doing well with trach mask.  Has baseline episodes of tachypnea,
   likely related to pain vs fever vs anxiety.
   - continue trach mask
   - continue fentanly boluses for pain
   - APAP and cooling blanket for fever
   # Hyperglycemia:  Sugars on arrival were 307.
    - Continue HISS and FSBG qid
   # Hypercalcemia: Continue vitamin D twice weekly for 3 more weeks and
   then recheck Ca and Vit D levels.
   # Hypothyroidism: He was recently started on Levothyroxine, and his
   dose was increased to 50 mcg daily.
    - Continue Levoxyl 50 mcg daily
   # Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis
   complicated by known necrosis and pseudocytst.  His lipase was elevated
   at [**Hospital3 **], and most recent CT scan showed enlargement of

","Summary:
The patient is an unresponsive individual with a history of respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, and fever of unknown origin. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on multiple medications, including pain medication. The patient has allergies to meropenem and has experienced skin blisters as a result. Their vital signs show sinus tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit levels, and increased platelet count. There are also abnormalities in kidney function, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers. The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake and output discrepancy, with more fluid being given than what is accounted for in urine output. The patient is receiving nutritional support through NovaSource Renal and is being monitored for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line and a 20-gauge line. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and ongoing need for respiratory support indicate that they may be at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or worsening hypoxia.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of necrotizing pancreatitis and multiple complications, including multiple episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests. He presents to the ICU from rehab with severe anemia and large hematomas in his lower extremities. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which is currently being managed with tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory distress is essential.

2. Hypotension: The patient has stable blood pressure but has a history of fluid-responsive hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.

3. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia due to acute blood loss from large bilateral thigh hematomas. Blood transfusions may be required to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.

4. Fever: The patient has low-grade fevers, which may be due to hematomas, medications, or a new infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

5. Possible Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has purulent tracheal secretions and a possible retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray. Repeating the chest X-ray and obtaining sputum cultures are necessary to rule out VAP.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of necrotizing pancreatitis and multiple complications, including PEA arrests.
- He presents with severe anemia, very large hematomas in the lower extremities, and encephalopathy.
- The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, fever of unknown origin, and status epilepticus.
- His vital signs show tachycardia, tachypnea, and a fever.
- The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
- He has an NG tube, OG/NT tube, and is on mechanical ventilation.
- His blood work shows anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis.
- Imaging reveals a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray.
- The patient's condition has been stable with improvement, but new developments include purulent sputum and possible pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and purulent sputum suggests the possibility of an infection leading to sepsis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings may indicate the development of pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain
   injury, and seizures, who presents from rehab facility with anemia,
   fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed.
   # Posterior thigh hematomas: Pt was given 3 [**Location 392**] with hct change
   from 20 -> 24, now stable.  Bleeding is secondary to posterior thigh
   hematomas in setting of lovenox.
   - hold lovenox
   - monitor thigh
   # Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive upon arrival the the ICU,
   and he was reportedly hypotensive at [**Hospital 25**] rehab.  He was given 500
   cc NS each hour in order to obtain 50 cc UOP/h, but boluses now stopped
   with stable BP. Attributed to blood loss. Currently BP has been stable.
   # Fevers:  The patient has had persistent fevers for the past four
   days, accompanied with an increasing leukocytosis.  Blood cultures at
   rehab were negative to date.  Most likely this is a central process.
   Also with urethral discharge with yeast growing.  GC/chlamydia negative
   and herpes pending.   Respiratory cultures likely to demonstrate
   persistence of GNRs but may be colonization.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now, as patient's blood cultures have been
   negative.  If needed, may restart Tobramycin and Ceftax (may be abx
   failure)
   - f/u urine cx, herpes
   - stool studies pending
   # Chronic respiratory failure:  was on and off pressure support and has
   been doing well of PS.  Has baseline episodes of tachypnea, likely
   related to pain vs fever vs anxiety. Increased secretions overnight on
   [**8-20**] with ? infection.    Respiratory cultures likely to demonstrate
   persistence of GNRs but may be colonization.
   - monitor wbcs, secretions, repeat CXR, f/u sputum cultures
   - continue fentanly boluses for pain
   # Hyperglycemia:  Sugars on arrival were 307.
    - Continue HISS and FSBG qid
   # Hypothyroidism: He was recently started on Levothyroxine, and his
   dose was increased to 50 mcg daily.
    - Continue Levoxyl 50 mcg daily
    - should recheck TSH/FT4 as outpatient in 2 weeks as outpatient
   # Seizure D/O: Dilantin level this morning was therapeutic this
   morning.  Continue current regimen.
   # Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis
   complicated by known necrosis and pseudocytst.  His lipase was elevated
   at [**Hospital3 **], and most recent CT scan showed enlargement of
   pseudocysts.
   # Prophylaxis: Hold on Lovenox for now; has pneumoboots
   # Access: PICC and one PIV

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of ethanol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He presents from a rehabilitation facility with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed. The patient has been diagnosed with posterior thigh hematomas, hypotension, and persistent fevers with increasing leukocytosis. Blood cultures have been negative to date. The patient also has chronic respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, and a history of severe pancreatitis complicated by known necrosis and pseudocysts. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute bleed: The patient's presentation with anemia, fevers, and hypotension suggests a possible acute bleed, possibly secondary to posterior thigh hematomas in the setting of lovenox use. Immediate intervention is required to stabilize the patient's condition.

2. Central infection: The patient's persistent fevers and increasing leukocytosis indicate a potential central infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.

3. Respiratory infection: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and increased secretions overnight, which could indicate a respiratory infection. Monitoring white blood cell counts, secretions, repeating chest X-ray, and following up with sputum cultures are recommended.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocysts. Monitoring lipase"

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be monitored and managed. These include:

1. Posterior thigh hematomas: The patient has bleeding secondary to posterior thigh hematomas, possibly due to low-molecular-weight heparin (lovenox). The plan is to hold lovenox and monitor the thigh area.

2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive upon arrival in the ICU and at the rehab facility. His blood pressure has stabilized after receiving normal saline boluses to maintain a urine output of 50 cc per hour. Boluses have been stopped now that his blood pressure is stable.

3. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers for the past four days, accompanied by increasing leukocytosis. Blood cultures from the rehab facility were negative. The most likely cause of the fever seems to be a central process. There is also urethral discharge with yeast growing, but other infections such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes are negative or pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, prolonged hospitalization, and recent re-admission to the MICU after experiencing a dramatic drop in hematocrit due to large thigh hematomas while on systemic anticoagulation. The patient is currently off anticoagulation with a stable hematocrit level. He has persistent fevers without a clear source, which may be attributed to resolving hematomas. Other potential sources of fever include the PICC line and pneumonia, although blood cultures have been negative and the chest X-ray did not reveal any new infiltrates. Antibiotics have been withheld due to the possibility of contamination in the blood cultures, and further follow-up cultures will be conducted. The patient's improving mental status is encouraging.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers could indicate an ongoing infection, potentially leading to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's history of necrotizing pancreatitis and anoxic brain injury puts him at risk for organ dysfunction, including kidney and liver impairment.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of large thigh hematomas increases the risk of developing DVT, especially considering the patient was on systemic anticoagulation.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and the potential for pneumonia or complications related to mechanical ventilation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and prolonged hospitalization. He was recently readmitted to the MICU after experiencing a significant drop in hematocrit due to large thigh hematomas caused by systemic anticoagulation. The patient's condition has improved, and he is now off anticoagulation with a stable hematocrit level. 

The patient presents with persistent fevers without a clear source. Potential sources of fever include resolving hematomas, the picc line, and pneumonia. Blood cultures have been negative, and chest X-ray has not shown any new infiltrates. Antibiotics have been withheld, and further follow-up cultures will be done.

The patient's mental status is improving, which is encouraging. Rehabilitation services will be contacted for a more complete sign-off and transfer of care. The rest of the plan is per the resident's notes.

ICU care includes NovaSource Renal (Full) nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and appropriate prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers could indicate an underlying infection. The negative blood cultures and lack of new infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest that the source of infection may be resolving hematomas or the picc line.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain
   injury, and seizures, who presents from rehab facility with anemia,
   fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed.
   # Posterior thigh hematomas: Pt was given 3 [**Location 392**] with hct change
   from 20 -> 24, now stable.  Bleeding is secondary to posterior thigh
   hematomas in setting of lovenox.
   - hold lovenox
   - monitor thigh
   # Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive upon arrival the the ICU,
   and he was reportedly hypotensive at [**Hospital 25**] rehab.  He was given 500
   cc NS each hour in order to obtain 50 cc UOP/h, but boluses now stopped
   with stable BP. Attributed to blood loss. Currently BP has been stable.
   # Fevers:  The patient has had persistent fevers for the past four
   days, accompanied with an increasing leukocytosis.  Blood cultures at
   rehab were negative to date.  Most likely this is a central process.
   Also with urethral discharge with yeast growing.  GC/chlamydia negative
   and herpes pending.   Respiratory cultures likely to demonstrate
   persistence of GNRs but may be colonization.  PICC pulled and may have
   had bacteria but no evidence of bacteremia at this time.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now, as patient's blood cultures have been
   negative and PICC line has been pulled.  If needed, may restart
   Tobramycin and Ceftax (may be abx failure)
   - f/u urine cx, herpes
   - stool studies pending
   # Chronic respiratory failure:  was on and off pressure support and has
   been doing well of PS.  Has baseline episodes of tachypnea, likely
   related to pain vs fever vs anxiety. Increased secretions overnight on
   [**8-20**] with ? infection.    Respiratory cultures likely to demonstrate
   persistence of GNRs but may be colonization.
   - monitor wbcs, secretions, f/u sputum cultures
   - continue fentanly boluses for pain
   # Hyperglycemia:  Sugars on arrival were 307.
    - Continue HISS and FSBG qid
   # Hypothyroidism: He was recently started on Levothyroxine, and his
   dose was increased to 50 mcg daily.
    - Continue Levoxyl 50 mcg daily
    - should recheck TSH/FT4 as outpatient in 2 weeks as outpatient
   # Seizure D/O: Dilantin level was therapeutic on [**2131-8-21**].  Continue
   current regimen.
   # Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis
   complicated by known necrosis and pseudocytst.  His lipase was elevated
   at [**Hospital3 **], and most recent CT scan showed enlargement of
   pseudocysts.
   # Prophylaxis: heparin sc; has pneumoboots

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He presented with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, and is now in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thigh hematoma: The patient has posterior thigh hematomas, which led to bleeding and required holding of lovenox and monitoring of the thigh.
2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive upon arrival and during rehabilitation. It was attributed to blood loss, but now the blood pressure has stabilized.
3. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers for four days, accompanied by increasing leukocytosis. Blood cultures at the rehab facility were negative, and there may be a central or urinary source of infection.
4. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient required pressure support and has episodes of tachypnea, likely related to pain, fever, or anxiety. Increased secretions were observed, indicating a possible infection.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient had elevated sugars on arrival, and continues to require monitoring and management of blood glucose levels.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient was started on Levothyroxine and his dose was increased. He will need ongoing monitoring of thyroid function.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient requires ongoing management of his seizure disorder with Dilation therapy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of ethanol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He presents with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, which are concerning for an acute bleed. The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Thigh hematoma: The patient has posterior thigh hematomas, which may lead to further bleeding and potentially require surgical intervention.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive upon arrival in the ICU and at the rehab facility. This could be attributed to blood loss from the thigh hematomas or another underlying cause.

3. Persistent fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers for the past four days, accompanied by increasing leukocytosis. Blood cultures at the rehab facility were negative. This suggests a possible central infection, and further investigation is needed.

4. Urinary tract infection: The patient has urethral discharge with yeast growing. Gram stain of the discharge revealed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. This indicates a yeast infection, and appropriate antifungal treatment should be initiated.

5. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient has episodes of tachypnea likely related to pain, fever, or anxiety. Increased secretions overnight suggest a possible infection. Monitoring white blood cell count, secretions, repeating chest X-ray, and following up with sputum cultures are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain
   injury, and seizures, who presents from rehab facility with anemia,
   fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed.
   # Posterior thigh hematomas: Pt was given 3 [**Location 392**] with hct change
   from 20 -> 24, now stable.  Bleeding is secondary to posterior thigh
   hematomas in setting of lovenox.
   - hold lovenox
   - monitor thigh
   # Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive upon arrival the the ICU,
   and he was reportedly hypotensive at [**Hospital 25**] rehab.  He was given 500
   cc NS each hour in order to obtain 50 cc UOP/h, but boluses now stopped
   with stable BP. Attributed to blood loss. Currently BP has been stable.
   # Fevers:  The patient has had persistent fevers for the past four
   days, accompanied with an increasing leukocytosis.  Blood cultures at
   rehab were negative to date.  Most likely this is a central process.
   Also with urethral discharge with yeast growing.  GC/chlamydia negative
   and herpes pending.   Respiratory cultures likely to demonstrate
   persistence of GNRs but may be colonization.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now, as patient's blood cultures have been
   negative.  If needed, may restart Tobramycin and Ceftax (may be abx
   failure)
   - f/u urine cx, herpes
   - stool studies pending
   # Chronic respiratory failure:  was on and off pressure support and has
   been doing well of PS.  Has baseline episodes of tachypnea, likely
   related to pain vs fever vs anxiety. Increased secretions overnight on
   [**8-20**] with ? infection.    Respiratory cultures likely to demonstrate
   persistence of GNRs but may be colonization.
   - monitor wbcs, secretions, repeat CXR, f/u sputum cultures
   - continue fentanly boluses for pain
   # Hyperglycemia:  Sugars on arrival were 307.
    - Continue HISS and FSBG qid
   # Hypothyroidism: He was recently started on Levothyroxine, and his
   dose was increased to 50 mcg daily.
    - Continue Levoxyl 50 mcg daily
    - should recheck TSH/FT4 as outpatient in 2 weeks as outpatient
   # Seizure D/O: Dilantin level this morning was therapeutic this
   morning.  Continue current regimen.
   # Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis
   complicated by known necrosis and pseudocytst.  His lipase was elevated
   at [**Hospital3 **], and most recent CT scan showed enlargement of
   pseudocysts.
   # Prophylaxis: Hold on Lovenox for now; has pneumoboots
   # Access: PICC and one PIV

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, necrotizing pancreatitis, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He presented to the ICU with anemia, fevers, and hypotension, concerning for an acute bleed. The patient has posterior thigh hematomas, which are likely causing the bleeding. His blood pressure is stable after receiving fluid resuscitation. He has persistent fevers and increasing leukocytosis, indicating a possible central infection. Blood cultures have been negative so far. The patient also has chronic respiratory failure and requires pressure support. His blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is on multiple medications including antiepileptic drugs, thyroid hormone replacement, and prophylactic heparin. The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis with known necrosis and pseudocysts.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding is secondary to posterior thigh hematomas in the setting of low molecular weight heparin (lovenox). Heparin should be held, and the hematomas should be monitored.
2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive upon arrival in the ICU and at the rehabilitation facility. Hypotension is likely due to blood loss, but it has been stabilized with fluid resuscitation.
3. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers and increasing leukocytosis, indicating a possible central infection. Blood cultures have been negative so far. There"

   hematomas while on full anticoagulation, now stable off full
   anticoagulation, slowly-improving mental status. Mr [**Known lastname 6420**] remains
   tachycardic and febrile. His sputum culture is growing previously known
   resistant pseudomonas, and peripheral blood cultures from have been
   negative. We are holding off on antibiotics given stable clinical
   status and no signs of active pulmonary or blood stream infection. Will
   proceed with transfer back to [**Hospital1 25**] with close communication with
   staff at [**Hospital1 25**] for aggressive monitoring for signs of worsening
   infection:
   positive blood cultures
   -follow-up cultures over the last several day; will communicate with
   new providers
   -hold off on new picc line unless necessary
   -hold off on empiric abx; if necessary prefer linezolid
   -monitor thigh hematomas for signs of infection
   positive sputum cultures; secretions
   -holding off on antibiotics
   -would need meropenem if shows signs of active pulmonary infection
   -MIE, though cough if excellent

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with necrotizing pancreatitis and a history of several PEA arrests and anoxic brain injury. He has been in the ICU with acute hematoma and hct drop while on full anticoagulation, but is now stable off full anticoagulation and showing slowly improving mental status. The patient's vital signs include tachycardia and fever. He has sputum culture growing previously known resistant pseudomonas, but peripheral blood cultures are negative. Antibiotics have been withheld due to stable clinical status. The patient is planned to be transferred back to Hospital1 with close communication for aggressive monitoring of signs of worsening infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's sputum culture is growing resistant pseudomonas, indicating a potential pulmonary infection. Close monitoring for signs of active infection and consideration of appropriate antibiotics, such as meropenem, may be necessary.
2. Thigh hematomas: The patient has thigh hematomas, which can potentially lead to infection. Monitoring these hematomas for signs of infection is essential.
3. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, which could be due to pain, infection, or centrally driven causes. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
4. Seizure: The patient had a seizure, and appropriate doses of antiepileptic drugs should"
