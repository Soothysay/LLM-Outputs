   =================
   Patient with evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis. Had fever with symptoms
   of urinary tract infection, although UA not impressive. Would treat for
   UTI at this time. CXR clear; no acute ECG changes. Patient still with
   evidence of volume depletion by exam and labs (blood sugar > 500). Need
   to increase fluids (at least 4L down) and increase insulin (bicarb has
   dropped from admission to ED). Would bolus with 7 units of insulin and
   continue insulin infusion. [**Month (only) 60**] be somewhat insulin resistant with
   possible infection. Would begin to replete potassium now along with
   magnesium. No need to give bicarbonate now. Contact [**Name (NI) 276**] team later
   today.
   Hct down chronically. No evidence of active bleeding. Will probably
   drop with volume resuscitation. Not at transfusion threshold.
   Try to place PIC line later today and remove groin line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, gastroparesis, and other comorbidities, admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has been treated with insulin and IV fluids, but remains hyperglycemic with a blood sugar level of 544. She has also presented with fever, dysuria, and nausea, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Her vital signs are stable, with sinus tachycardia and normal oxygen saturation. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no evidence of edema or cyanosis. The patient is alert, oriented, and follows simple commands. Lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and electrolyte imbalances. The chest X-ray shows no infiltrates or effusions. The patient's current assessment includes diabetic ketoacidosis, fever, anemia, gastroparesis, and possible UTI. The plan is to continue insulin infusion, replete potassium and magnesium, and treat the UTI. The patient will be monitored closely in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) - If not managed properly, DKA can progress to severe complications such as cerebral edema, renal failure, cardiovascular collapse, and even death.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) - If left untreated, a UTI"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 597**] is a 55 year old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus with
   many admissions for DKA, who presents with DKA.
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient has history of many admissions for
   DKA.
   It is not entirely clear what prompted this episode, though could be
   secondary to poor PO intake coupled with urinary tract infection. Urine
   anaylsis was unremarkable, EKG was overall unchanged. CXR without
   evidence of infiltrate. Pt is not on any medications / drugs that
   precipitate DKA.
   - Continue to hydrate with LR (at least 6L)
   - Monitoring q4hour electrolytes, especially potassium, anion gap
   - Continue insulin drip until anion gap closes and glucose <200, then
   start sub-cutaneous insulin (start with home dose of Lantus 28 units)
   to overlap with insulin gtt for an hour before insulin gtt is d/c
   - continue IVF with 1/2NS with D5
   - replete K when when  <5
   - Checking VBG [**Hospital1 **] to get sense of pH
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Will touch base with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team in AM to let them know she has been
   admitted
   .
   # Question of urinary tract infection:
   - f/u repeat urine analysis and culture.
   - d/c cipro given no evidence of UTI
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normo-tensive
   - Will re-start and adjust home medications this afternoon when BP is
   stable.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Patient's corrected sodium for her hyperglycemia is
   actually 135, so she is not truly hyponatremic. Will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Baseline appears to be 0.7-0.8.
   Suspect this is due to poor PO intake in setting of nauesa and
   gastroparesis, coupled with osmotic diuresis from DKA and taking [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   and NSAIDs.
   - can restart naproxen, Cozaar if repeat lytes continue to show
   baseline Creatinine
   - IVF for treatment of DKA as discussed above
   - Should renal function not return to baseline, would further work-up
   with renal ultrasound, FeNa, etc.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Closed after aggressive IVF resuscitation.
   Suspect largely due to DKA, however patient does have elevated lactate
   that may also be playing a role. BUN also elevated above her baseline
   (10->20). No gap of the gap (no secondary acid-base disorder) appears
   to be present.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Checking VBG [**Hospital1 **] to get sense of pH
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 598**] disease: TSH was 0.068 during last admission, however
   difficult to interpret as this is checked in setting of acute infection
   and DKA admission.
   - Continue methimazole
   .
   # Asthma: No significant wheezing on examination to suggest
   exacerbation.
   - Contiue home medications
   .
   # Anemia: Currently HCT much better than baseline (27ish), likely
   representing hemoconcentration.
   - Guaiac stools, continue to monitor.
   .
   # GERD: Continue protonix
   .
   # Depression, anxiety: Continue amitriptyline and diazepam
   .
   # Chronic pain: Continue home regimen of percocet, neurontin

   Disposition: ICU for now. Can transfer to floor once pt does not
   require insulin gtt
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
- She presents with DKA, possibly secondary to poor oral intake and a urinary tract infection.
- The patient is currently receiving intravenous fluids (LR and D5 1/2NS) and an insulin drip.
- Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 119/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, but other electrolytes and kidney function tests are within normal limits.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, but currently her blood pressure is controlled.
- There is no evidence of an active urinary tract infection, so ciprofloxacin has been discontinued.
- The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to hyperglycemia, so it does not require correction.
- Acute renal failure has resolved, possibly due to poor oral intake and osmotic diuresis from DKA.
- Anion gap acidosis has closed after aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, but elevated lactate levels may still be contributing to the acidosis.
- The patient has a history of Hashimoto's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 597**] is a 55 year old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus with
   many admissions for DKA, who presents with DKA.
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient has history of many admissions for
   DKA.
   It is not entirely clear what prompted this episode, though could be
   secondary to poor PO intake coupled with urinary tract infection. Urine
   anaylsis was unremarkable, EKG was overall unchanged. CXR without
   evidence of infiltrate.
   - Continue to hydrate with normal saline or lactated ringers (given
   wish to avoid hyperchloriemic acidosis), with 1 L boluses until fluid
   status improved
   - Monitoring q4hour electrolytes, especially potassium, anion gap
   - Continue insulin drip until anion gap closes, glucose <200, then
   start sub-cutaneous insulin (start with home dose of Lantus 28 units)
   and IVF with 1/2NS with D5
   - Initiate IVF with potassium for goal potassium [**4-25**], starting when
   potassium <5
   - Send blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up final read on chest x-ray
   - Will touch base with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team in AM to let them know she has been
   admitted
   .
   # Question of urinary tract infection: Sending repeat urine analysis
   and culture.
   - Will initiate ciprofloxacin for now after repeat culture sent, can
   stop if negative
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normo-tensive upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**].
   - Will re-start and adjust home medications as needed
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Patient's corrected sodium for her hyperglycemia is
   actually 135, so she is not truly hyponatremic. Will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline appears to be 0.7-0.8. Suspect this is
   due to poor PO intake in setting of nauesa and gastroparesis, coupled
   with osmotic diuresis from DKA and taking [**Last Name (un) 239**] and NSAIDs.
   - Holding naproxen, Cozaar
   - IVF for treatment of DKA as discussed above
   - Should renal function not return to baseline, would further work-up
   with renal ultrasound, FeNa, etc.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Suspect largely due to DKA, however patient does
   have elevated lactate that may also be playing a role. BUN also
   elevated above her baseline (10->20). No gap of the gap (no secondary
   acid-base disorder) appears to be present.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Checking albumin to further assess gap
   - Checking VBG to get sense of pH
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 598**] disease: TSH was 0.068 during last admission, however
   difficult to interpret as this is checked in setting of acute infection
   and DKA admission.
   - Continue methimazole
   .
   # Asthma: No significant wheezing on examination to suggest
   exacerbation.
   - Contiue home medications
   .
   # Anemia: Currently HCT much better than baseline (27ish), likely
   representing hemoconcentration.
   - Guaiac stools, continue to monitor.
   .
   # GERD: Continue protonix
   .
   # Depression, anxiety: Continue amitriptyline and diazepam
   .
   # Chronic pain: Continue home regimen of percocet, neurontin

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She presents with DKA, which has now resolved with hydration and insulin therapy. Her blood sugars are in the normal range, and her urine and blood ketones have corrected. She is currently on subcutaneous insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the provided progress note include:
1. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urine culture results are pending, and there is a suspicion of a urinary tract infection. If confirmed, it may require appropriate antibiotic treatment.
2. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, she has a history of hypertension. It will be important to monitor her blood pressure and restart her home medications if necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has shown improvement in her renal function, but close monitoring is still required.
4. Thyroid disease: The patient has a history of [**Doctor Last Name 598**] disease, and her TSH levels were abnormal during her last admission. Further evaluation and management of her thyroid condition may be needed.
5. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, but no significant wheezing was observed during the examination. It is important to continue her home medications and monitor for any signs of exacerbation.

   Urine and blood cx NTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 597**] is a 55 year old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus with
   many admissions for DKA, who presents with DKA.
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient has history of many admissions for
   DKA.
   It is not entirely clear what prompted this episode, though could be
   secondary to poor PO intake coupled with urinary tract infection. Urine
   anaylsis was unremarkable, EKG was overall unchanged. CXR without
   evidence of infiltrate. Pt is not on any medications / drugs that
   precipitate DKA.
   - Continue to hydrate with LR (at least 6L)
   - Monitoring q4hour electrolytes, especially potassium, anion gap
   - Continue insulin drip until anion gap closes and glucose <200, then
   start sub-cutaneous insulin (start with home dose of Lantus 28 units)
   to overlap with insulin gtt for an hour before insulin gtt is d/c
   - continue IVF with 1/2NS with D5
   - replete K when when  <5
   - Checking VBG [**Hospital1 **] to get sense of pH
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Will touch base with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team in AM to let them know she has been
   admitted
   .
   # Question of urinary tract infection:
   - f/u repeat urine analysis and culture.
   - d/c cipro given no evidence of UTI
   - d/c Foley
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normo-tensive
   - Will re-start and adjust home medications this afternoon when BP is
   stable.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Patient's corrected sodium for her hyperglycemia is
   actually 135, so she is not truly hyponatremic. Will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Baseline appears to be 0.7-0.8.
   Suspect this is due to poor PO intake in setting of nauesa and
   gastroparesis, coupled with osmotic diuresis from DKA and taking [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   and NSAIDs.
   - can restart naproxen, [**Last Name (un) 10219**] if repeat lytes continue to show
   baseline Creatinine
   - IVF for treatment of DKA as discussed above
   - Should renal function not return to baseline, would further work-up
   with renal ultrasound, FeNa, etc.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Closed after aggressive IVF resuscitation.
   Suspect largely due to DKA, however patient does have elevated lactate
   that may also be playing a role. BUN also elevated above her baseline
   (10->20). No gap of the gap (no secondary acid-base disorder) appears
   to be present.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Checking VBG [**Hospital1 **] to get sense of pH
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 598**] disease: TSH was 0.068 during last admission, however
   difficult to interpret as this is checked in setting of acute infection
   and DKA admission.
   - Continue methimazole
   .
   # Asthma: No significant wheezing on examination to suggest
   exacerbation.
   - Contiue home medications
   .
   # Anemia: Currently HCT much better than baseline (27ish), likely
   representing hemoconcentration.
   - Guaiac stools, continue to monitor.
   .
   # GERD: Continue protonix
   .
   # Depression, anxiety: Continue amitriptyline and diazepam
   .
   # Chronic pain: Continue home regimen of percocet, neurontin

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus who presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has a history of multiple admissions for DKA and is currently experiencing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and rapid breathing. The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte imbalances including hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level. She also has an elevated lactate level and a history of asthma, anemia, GERD, depression, anxiety, and chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body starts breaking down fat at an excessive rate, leading to the production of ketones. If left untreated, DKA can lead to life-threatening complications such as cerebral edema, organ failure, and even death.

2. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and abnormal heart rhythms.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels may result in confusion, seizures, and other neurological symptoms.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's impaired renal function can progress to acute renal failure, which can lead to the accumulation of waste products in the body and electrolyte imbalances"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/54 mmHg to 141/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination revealed well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and decreased strength in the left lower extremity with pain. Neurological examination was limited due to pain. 

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, decreased hemoglobin, increased leukocyte count, increased creatinine, and normal kidney function. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for slightly low magnesium. Fluid balance shows an adequate intake and output with no signs of fluid overload.

The patient's pain is managed with Percocet as needed, and she is already on neurontin for neuropathic pain. The plan is to transfer her to the floor once stable. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Hypoglycemia: Since the patient is on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dosage is not adjusted properly.
2. Infection: Despite negative blood and urine cultures, the patient's immune system may still be compromised due to diabetes, increasing the risk of infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged bed rest and limited mobility increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating a potential risk of hypotension.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's glucose levels, watch for signs of infection, ensure proper mobility and skin care, and regularly assess for DVT and blood pressure abnormalities during the transfer to the floor."
