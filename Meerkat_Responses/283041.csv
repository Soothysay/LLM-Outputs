   supplying the basal segments of the right lower lobe, possibly chronic
   given their eccentric appearance.
   2. Severe bullous emphysema with nodule in the right lung apex for
   which short interval followup is advised.
   3. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy may be related to patient's known
   CLL.
   4. Cardiomegaly.
   5. Left adrenal nodularity, incompletely imaged though grossly stable
   from 08 exam. Recommend CT or MRI to further evaluate as needed.
   CT Head [**3-10**]
   no acute abnormality. MRI more senstive for detection of intracranial
   lesions.
   TTE [**3-10**]
   The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
   normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
   moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic
   septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
   overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   There is mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse (A2>P2). An eccentric,
   posteriorly-directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with moderate systolic dysfunction.
   Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Bileaflet MVP with
   moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. At
   least mild pulmonary hypertension.
   CT Chest [**3-3**]
   New peripheral lung nodules could be inflammatory/infectious.
   Right upper lobe soft tissue filling of the scarring could be
   malignancy . PET CT can be performed to further evaluate this finding.
   Infectious etiology is felt much less likely
   Other smaller lung nodules are stable.
   Stable severe emphysema.
   Unchanged appearance of the esophagus.
   Spirometry [**2185-2-24**]
   FVC 79%, FEV1 71%, FEV1/FVC 90%
   Mild obstructive ventilatory defect. The reduced FVC is likely due to
   gas trapping given the normal TLC measured on [**2183-8-8**]. Compared to
   the prior study of [**2183-11-6**] there has been no significant change.
   ECG: Atrial tachycardia, irregular, inconsistent P waves possibly
   consistent with MFAT, PR 222 c/w 1st degree av block, Qtc 433, QRS 82,
   TWI III, V2, V3, V4, no st changes

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of CLL, COPD, and hypertension. He presents with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's TTE shows signs of mild right heart strain and he is hemodynamically stable. Oxygen saturation is stable on NRB.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL: The patient has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which can increase the risk of developing blood clots, including PE. This condition can lead to further complications such as right heart strain and potentially worsening respiratory function.

2. Right heart strain: The patient's TTE indicates signs of mild right heart strain. This can occur as a result of long-standing PE, leading to increased pressure in the right ventricle and subsequent strain on the heart.

3. Troponin leak: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may be due to right heart strain from underlying PE. This indicates possible myocardial injury.

4. CHF: The patient's TTE shows an ejection fraction of 40%, suggesting mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Additionally, symptoms of orthopnea are present, which may indicate congestive heart failure (CHF).

5. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated baseline creatinine levels and edema on examination. Poor oral intake may contribute to"

   1. Pulmonary embolism involving the basal segments of the left lower
   lobe. Partially occlusive thrombus in the pulmonary arterial branches
   supplying the basal segments of the right lower lobe, possibly chronic
   given their eccentric appearance.
   2. Severe bullous emphysema with nodule in the right lung apex for
   which short interval followup is advised.
   3. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy may be related to patient's known
   CLL.
   4. Cardiomegaly.
   5. Left adrenal nodularity, incompletely imaged though grossly stable
   from 08 exam. Recommend CT or MRI to further evaluate as needed.
   CT Head [**3-10**]
   no acute abnormality. MRI more senstive for detection of intracranial
   lesions.
   TTE [**3-10**]
   The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
   normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
   moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic
   septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
   overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   There is mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse (A2>P2). An eccentric,
   posteriorly-directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with moderate systolic dysfunction.
   Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Bileaflet MVP with
   moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. At
   least mild pulmonary hypertension.
   CT Chest [**3-3**]
   New peripheral lung nodules could be inflammatory/infectious.
   Right upper lobe soft tissue filling of the scarring could be
   malignancy . PET CT can be performed to further evaluate this finding.
   Infectious etiology is felt much less likely
   Other smaller lung nodules are stable.
   Stable severe emphysema.
   Unchanged appearance of the esophagus.
   Spirometry [**2185-2-24**]
   FVC 79%, FEV1 71%, FEV1/FVC 90%
   Mild obstructive ventilatory defect. The reduced FVC is likely due to
   gas trapping given the normal TLC measured on [**2183-8-8**]. Compared to
   the prior study of [**2183-11-6**] there has been no significant change.
   ECG: Atrial tachycardia, irregular, inconsistent P waves possibly
   consistent with MFAT, PR 222 c/w 1st degree av block, Qtc 433, QRS 82,
   TWI III, V2, V3, V4, no st changes

   Imaging: CTA Chest [**3-10**]
   1. Pulmonary embolism involving the basal segments of the left lower
   lobe. Partially occlusive thrombus in the pulmonary arterial branches
   supplying the basal segments of the right lower lobe, possibly chronic
   given their eccentric appearance.
   2. Severe bullous emphysema with nodule in the right lung apex for
   which short interval followup is advised.
   3. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy may be related to patient's known
   CLL.
   4. Cardiomegaly.
   5. Left adrenal nodularity, incompletely imaged though grossly stable
   from 08 exam. Recommend CT or MRI to further evaluate as needed.
   CT Head [**3-10**]
   no acute abnormality. MRI more senstive for detection of intracranial
   lesions.
   TTE [**3-10**]
   The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
   normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
   moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic
   septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
   overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   There is mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse (A2>P2). An eccentric,
   posteriorly-directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with moderate systolic dysfunction.
   Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Bileaflet MVP with
   moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. At
   least mild pulmonary hypertension.
   CT Chest [**3-3**]
   New peripheral lung nodules could be inflammatory/infectious.
   Right upper lobe soft tissue filling of the scarring could be
   malignancy . PET CT can be performed to further evaluate this finding.
   Infectious etiology is felt much less likely
   Other smaller lung nodules are stable.
   Stable severe emphysema.
   Unchanged appearance of the esophagus.
   Spirometry [**2185-2-24**]
   FVC 79%, FEV1 71%, FEV1/FVC 90%
   Mild obstructive ventilatory defect. The reduced FVC is likely due to
   gas trapping given the normal TLC measured on [**2183-8-8**]. Compared to
   the prior study of [**2183-11-6**] there has been no significant change.
   ECG: Atrial tachycardia, irregular, inconsistent P waves possibly
   consistent with MFAT, PR 222 c/w 1st degree av block, Qtc 433, QRS 82,
   TWI III, V2, V3, V4, no st changes
   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so unlikely
   candidate for TPA or thrombectomy. Oxygen saturation stable on NRB.
   - Continue Heparin drip, does not need IVC filter.
   - Start to bridge with coumadin today, 5mg QD.
   - F/u final CT read; LENIs negative
   - Continue to hold anti-hypertensives, may re-start on floor.
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD.
   Cardiac enzymes reassuringly flat.
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. EDema on exam, but no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation.
   - Hold diuresis for now in setting of PE
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   - Hold betablockers for now in setting of low BPs.
   # Atrial tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior
   EKG for comparison. HR
   - HR reasonably controlled currently on Diltiazem, will continue
   Diltiazem.
   - Hold beta blocker
   - F/u EKG
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Acute renal failure: Maybe due to poor po intake. Baseline Cr around
   1.0. Edematous on exam.
   - Urine lytes
   - Mucomyst/bicarb post CT
   - Repeat lytes in Am
   - D/c Foley today.
   # COPD: FEV1 70. Ipratropium standing and albuterol PRN. Hold spiriva
   while on ipratropium.
   - Clarify pulmicort dosing
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC  25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Hold Antihypertensives as above
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presents with dyspnea over the last four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 105/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's ECG shows atrial tachycardia with a rate of 130 beats per minute, and there are signs of a first-degree AV block. The echocardiogram reveals a dilated right ventricle with moderate systolic dysfunction, mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, bileaflet mitral valve prolapse with moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and at least mild pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine levels. The chest CT scan shows evidence of chronic PE and severe bullous emphysema in the right lung apex. 

The patient's current medications include heparin drip, diltiazem, ipratropium, albuterol, and mucomyst/bicarb. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include acute renal failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presents with dyspnea over the last four months and is found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). He also has signs of mild right heart strain on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient is hemodynamically stable and not a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) or thrombectomy. He is currently on a heparin drip and will be bridged with coumadin today at a dose of 5mg QD, with an initial INR of 1.2. Anti-hypertensives are being held, but may be restarted on the floor. 

The patient sounds wheezy, indicating a probable COPD exacerbation contributing to respiratory distress. He is receiving intravenous (IV) steroids, nebulized bronchodilators, and antibiotics. His heart function shows a TTE with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% and evidence of right heart strain. The patient endorses symptoms of orthopnea, which may be related to acute PE. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, but no prior levels are available for comparison. There is some edema on exam, but the patient does not appear to be floridly fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He is currently admitted to the MICU for hypoxemia and bilateral distal PEs. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with initial improvement followed by worsening hypoxemia.

Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a known history of PE and is currently experiencing worsening hypoxemia. The treatment plan includes continuing heparin infusion to prevent further clot formation.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD symptoms have worsened, leading to hypoxemia. The management includes starting systemic corticosteroids (solumedrol), nebulized bronchodilators (xopenex instead of albuterol), and antibiotics (azithromycin).

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy.
   - Continue Heparin drip, does not need IVC filter.
   - Start to bridge with coumadin today, 5mg QD. INR 1.2
   - Continue to hold anti-hypertensives, may re-start on floor.
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
   -          Solumedrol 125mg Q8h x3 days. Today is day 1 of 3
   -          Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
   -          On xopinex q4h PRN
   -          On azithromycin
   -          HISS while on steroids
   -          PO PPI while on steroids
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Edema on exam, but no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation. Does not look floridly fluid overloaded.
   - Hold diuresis for now in setting of PE
   - Hold re-starting beta-blockers given that he is now on Diltiazem
   which is a better rate controlling [**Doctor Last Name 23**].
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Atrial tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior
   EKG for comparison. HR
   - HR reasonably controlled currently on Diltiazem, will continue
   Diltiazem.
   - Hold beta blocker
   - F/u EKG
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD.
   Cardiac enzymes reassuringly flat.
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: Maybe due to poor po intake. Baseline Cr around
   1.0. Edematous on exam.
   - Urine lytes
   - Mucomyst/bicarb post CT
   - Repeat lytes in Am
   - D/c Foley today.
   # COPD: FEV1 70. Ipratropium standing and albuterol PRN. Hold spiriva
   while on ipratropium.
   - Start/continue fluticasone
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC  25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Hold Antihypertensives as above
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low regular diet
   - D/c fluids today as diet advanced
   # Prophylaxis: heparin drip, PPI
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy.
   - Continue Heparin drip, does not need IVC filter.
   - Started coumadin yesterday, 5mg QD. INR 1.3
   - Continue to hold anti-hypertensives, may re-start on floor.
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
   -          Solumedrol 125mg Q8h x3 days. Today is day 2 of 3
   -          Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
   -          On xopinex q4h PRN
   -          On azithromycin
   -          HISS while on steroids
   -          PO PPI while on steroids
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Edema on exam, but no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation. Does not look floridly fluid overloaded.
   - Hold diuresis for now in setting of PE
   - Hold re-starting beta-blockers given that he is now on Diltiazem
   which is a better rate controlling [**Doctor Last Name 23**].
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Atrial tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior
   EKG for comparison. HR
   - HR reasonably controlled currently on Diltiazem, will continue
   Diltiazem.
   - Atenolol restarted yesterday
   - F/u EKG
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD.
   Cardiac enzymes reassuringly flat.
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: Maybe due to poor po intake. Baseline Cr around
   1.0. Edematous on exam.
   - Urine lytes
   - Mucomyst/bicarb post CT
   - Repeat lytes in Am
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC  25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Hold Antihypertensives as above
   .
   #Insomnia
   - Will start Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low regular diet

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presents with dyspnea for the last 4 months and is found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is hemodynamically stable and not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. He is currently on a heparin drip and started on coumadin yesterday with an INR of 1.3. Anti-hypertensives are held, but may be restarted on the floor. The patient also has a COPD exacerbation, which is being treated with steroids, nebulizers, and bronchodilators. He has symptoms suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF), but further evaluation is needed. The patient's atrial tachycardia is controlled with diltiazem, and atenolol has been restarted. Troponin leak is likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE, and cardiac enzymes are reassuringly flat. The patient may have acute renal failure due to poor oral intake, and further investigation is needed. Leukocytosis is present but not necessarily indicative of infection. Hypertension is also present and being managed. The patient has insomnia and will start trazodone. Family considerations and nutrition are also addressed in the plan. The patient will remain in the ICU today."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxemia, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), and a beta-blocker has been started. He is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has shown improvement in breathing but remains on intermittent high flow mask. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 133/86 to 135/106 mmHg, heart rate between 98 and 121 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's review of systems shows no fever, tachycardia, cough, or dyspnea. The patient appears comfortable with no pain. The flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of COPD: The patient's current condition suggests an acute worsening of his underlying COPD. This can lead to increased shortness of breath, coughing, and potential respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy.
   - Continue Heparin drip, does not need IVC filter.
   - Coumadin increased to 6.0 yesterday, INR today 1.9
   - Continue to hold anti-hypertensives, may re-start on floor.
   #Chest Pain:  pt. complained of some chest discomfort while eating, now
   resolved within minutes.  Substernal, nonradiating.  EKG showed some
   lateral T wave flattening, although lead placement may have been
   different from prior EKGs.  Unlikely
   -          Cycle cardiac enzymes
   -          Check repeat EKG this afternoon
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
   -          Solumedrol 125mg Q8h x3 days. Today is day 3 of 3
   -          Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
   -          On xopinex q4h PRN
   -          On azithromycin d4/5
   -          HISS while on steroids
   -          PO PPI while on steroids
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior. 1x
   10IV lasix yesterday with good results, now LOS net negative.
   - Hold further diuresis other than chlorthalidone given returning ARF
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Atrial tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior
   EKG for comparison. Had 12 beat run of V-Tach on [**3-13**].  Transitioned
   from diltiazem to betablocker.
   - Continue Atenolol 50mg daily
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD.
   - F/U cardiac enzymes
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: Originally presented with Cr 1.3 vs baseline 10
   likely pre-renal [**1-25**] poor PO intake, resumed to baseline with fluids,
   now back to 1.3 in setting of resent lasix and net negative balance.
   - repeat urine lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Hold Antihypertensives as above
   .
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: heparin drip, coumadin, PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presented with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is hemodynamically stable and not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. 

The patient complained of substernal chest discomfort while eating, which resolved within minutes. An EKG showed lateral T wave flattening, but lead placement may have been different from prior EKGs. 

The patient also has an exacerbation of COPD, with wheezing and respiratory distress. He is receiving inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics for this condition. 

The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 40% and signs of right heart strain on echocardiogram. He endorses symptoms of orthopnea, which may be related to acute PE. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, but there are no prior levels for comparison. The patient has minimal edema on examination, and the chest X-ray shows fluid overload. 

The patient had a transient episode of atrial tachycardia, possibly atrial fibrillation or multifocal atrial tachycardia. He has a history of ventricular tachyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been in the high 80s to low 90s, dipping to the low 80s at times. Nebulizers and non-rebreather masks have been used to maintain oxygen levels. A chest X-ray showed signs of fluid buildup, so Lasix was administered to help reduce it. The patient has been prescribed OxycoDONE, furosemide, warfarin, and traZODONE for various conditions. The patient has no known drug allergies and received azithromycin on 03/14/2018 at 11:15 AM. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and pantoprazole. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/73 mmHg to 133/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a first-degree AV block heart rhythm. The patient's weight has increased from 68.1 kg at admission to 72.4 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,482 mL total, with 138 mL through IV fluids, 960 mL orally, and 522 mL through total parenteral nutrition. The patient has had a blood product transfusion of 2,025 mL, and urine output is 2,025 mL. The patient has been on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and non-rebreather mask, with ABG results showing pH 7.25, PaCO2 30 mmHg, and PaO2 168 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals a white blood cell count of 25.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 41.8%, and platelet count of 155 K/uL. Other lab results include sodium of 133 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 98 mEq/L, calcium of 9.5 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL, phosphorus of 4.0 mg/dL, glucose of 168 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, and lactic acid is at 1.1 mmol/L. Albumin is 3.4 g/dL, calcium is 9.5 mg/dL, and magnesium is 2.3 mg/dL. The patient's PT is 20.9, PTT is 139.4, and INR is 1.9.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and the need for respiratory support indicate potential respiratory distress.
2. Fluid Overload: The increased weight and fluid balance suggest the possibility of fluid overload.
3. Infection: Elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection.
4. Bleeding Risk: The prolonged PT, PTT, and INR suggest an increased risk of bleeding.
5. Insulin Resistance: The elevated glucose levels may indicate insulin resistance or poor glycemic control.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: Abnormal levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus may indicate electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy.
   - Continue Heparin drip, does not need IVC filter.
   - Coumadin increased to 6.0 yesterday, INR today 1.9
   - Continue to hold anti-hypertensives, may re-start on floor.
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
   -          Solumedrol 125mg Q8h x3 days. Today is day 3 of 3
   -          Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
   -          On xopinex q4h PRN
   -          On azithromycin d4/5
   -          HISS while on steroids
   -          PO PPI while on steroids
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior. 1x
   10IV lasix yesterday with good results, now LOS net negative.
   - Hold further diuresis other than chlorthalidone given returning ARF
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Atrial tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior
   EKG for comparison. HR
   - HR reasonably controlled currently on Diltiazem, will continue
   Diltiazem.
   - Continue Atenolol 50mg daily
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD.
   Cardiac enzymes reassuringly flat.
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: Originally presented with Cr 1.3 vs baseline 10
   likely pre-renal [**1-25**] poor PO intake, resumed to baseline with fluids,
   now back to 1.3 in setting of resent lasix and net negative balance.
   - repeat urine lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Hold Antihypertensives as above
   .
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: heparin drip, coumadin, PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. The patient presents with dyspnea for the past four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient also has signs of mild right heart strain on echocardiogram (TTE) and is hemodynamically stable, making him not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy.

The patient's current conditions and treatment plan include:

1. PE: The patient likely has an acute-on-chronic PE in the setting of CLL. He is receiving a heparin drip and Coumadin has been increased to 6.0 with an INR of 1.9. No IVC filter is needed.

2. COPD exacerbation: The patient sounds wheezy and likely has a COPD exacerbation contributing to respiratory distress. Treatment includes Solumedrol 125mg Q8h x3 days, standing nebs with fluticasone and ipratropium q6hr standing, xopinex q4h PRN, azithromycin d4/5, HISS while on steroids, and PO PPI while on steroids.

3. CHF: The patient has a TTE with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% and right heart strain."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and pulmonary embolism (PE). He is currently admitted to the MICU with hypoxemia and bilateral distal PEs. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues including acute exacerbation of COPD, PE, congestive heart failure (CHF), tachycardia/atrial fibrillation, chest pain, elevated creatinine levels, and difficulty weaning off oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a compromised respiratory function. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The presence of bilateral distal PEs increases the risk of further embolic events, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
3. Acute Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's COPD is worsening, leading to increased symptoms and impaired respiratory function. This can result in respiratory failure if not treated effectively.
4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's CHF symptoms suggest a weakened cardiac function. If not managed appropriately, this can progress to cardiogenic shock and organ failure.
5. Tachycardia/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's rapid heart rate and irregular heartbeat increase the risk of complications such as stroke, heart attack,"

   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy.
   - Continue Heparin drip, does not need IVC filter.
   - Coumadin increased to 6.0 yesterday, INR today 4.0
   - Would hold Coumadin today and give 5 tomorrow?
   - Continue to hold anti-hypertensives, may re-start on floor.
   #Chest Pain:  pt. complained of some chest discomfort while eating, now
   resolved within minutes.  Substernal, nonradiating.  EKG showed some
   lateral T wave flattening, although lead placement may have been
   different from prior EKGs.  Unlikely

   -          Check repeat EKG this afternoon
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
   -          Solumedrol 125mg Q8h x3 days. Yesterday  was day 3 of 3
   -          d/c Solumedrol today and begin Prednisone taper. 60 mg X 2
   days and then decrease by 10 daily.
   -          Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
   -          On xopinex q4h PRN
   -          On azithromycin d4/5
   -          HISS while on steroids
   -          PO PPI while on steroids

   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior. 1x
   10IV lasix yesterday with good results, now LOS net negative.
   - Hold further diuresis other than chlorthalidone given returning ARF
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Atrial tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior
   EKG for comparison. Had 12 beat run of V-Tach on [**3-13**].  Transitioned
   from diltiazem to betablocker.
   - Continue Atenolol 50mg daily
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD.
   - Pt [**Name (NI) **] yesterday
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: Originally presented with Cr 1.3 vs baseline 10
   likely pre-renal [**1-25**] poor PO intake, resumed to baseline with fluids,
   now back to 1.3 in setting of resent lasix and net negative balance.
   - repeat urine lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Hold Antihypertensives as above

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presented with dyspnea over the last four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is hemodynamically stable and is being treated with heparin drip. He has been started on Coumadin with an INR of 4.0, but it will be held today and restarted at a lower dose tomorrow.

The patient also experienced chest pain while eating, which resolved within minutes. His EKG showed lateral T wave flattening, but lead placement may have been different from prior EKGs. Cardiac enzymes are being cycled, and a repeat EKG will be checked this afternoon.

The patient has a COPD exacerbation, with wheezing and likely has respiratory distress. He was given Solumedrol 125mg Q8h x3 days, and now it will be discontinued, and he will begin a Prednisone taper. He will also continue with standing nebs of fluticasone and ipratropium q6hr, xopinex q4h PRN, azithromycin d4/5, HISS while on steroids, and PO PPI while on steroids.

The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF)"

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - Stop Heparin drip, does not need IVC filter.
   - Coumadin increased to 6.0 yesterday, INR today 4.0
   - Would hold Coumadin today and give 5 or 6 tomorrow pending AM INR
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
   -          Solumedrol 125mg Q8h x3 days. Yesterday  was day 3 of 3
   -          d/c Solumedrol today and begin Prednisone taper. 60 mg X 2
   days and then decrease by 10 daily.
   -          Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
   -          On xopinex q4h PRN
   -          Completed course of azithromycin
   -          HISS while on steroids
   -          PO PPI while on steroids
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior. 1x
   10IV lasix yesterday with good results, now LOS net negative.
   - Hold further diuresis other than chlorthalidone given returning ARF
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Atrial tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior
   EKG for comparison. Had 12 beat run of V-Tach on [**3-13**].  Transitioned
   from diltiazem to betablocker.
   - Continue Atenolol 50mg daily
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   #Chest Pain:  pt. complained of some chest discomfort while eating, now
   resolved within minutes.  Substernal, nonradiating.  EKG showed some
   lateral T wave flattening, although lead placement may have been
   different from prior EKGs.  Unlikely
   -          Pt ruled out for MI yesterday
   -          Chest pain free since yesterday AM
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD.
   - Pt [**Name (NI) **] yesterday
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: Originally presented with Cr 1.3 vs baseline 10
   likely pre-renal [**1-25**] poor PO intake, resumed to baseline with fluids,
   now back to 1.3 in setting of resent lasix and net negative balance.
   - repeat urine lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Hold Antihypertensives as above
   .
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presented with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). He also has signs of mild right heart strain on a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) but is hemodynamically stable and not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. He is currently being treated with Coumadin.

The patient is also experiencing a COPD exacerbation, with wheezing and respiratory distress. He has been receiving steroids, bronchodilators, and inhaled corticosteroids as part of his treatment.

There are indications of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40% and right heart strain. The patient reports symptoms of orthopnea, which could be related to acute PE. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, and there are signs of fluid overload on the chest X-ray. He has received one dose of intravenous lasix with good results.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial tachycardia, possibly atrial fibrillation or multifocal atrial tachycardia. He had a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He was admitted to the ICU due to chest pain, suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has been receiving O2 therapy, heparin sodium infusion, and other medications. His vital signs have stabilized, with a heart rate in the 100s and blood pressure within normal range. The patient's temperature is slightly low. His oxygen saturation is at 97% on high-flow neb. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The patient's current weight is 72.4 kg, with a total fluid intake of 2,406 mL and output of 3,887 mL. The balance is negative 1,481 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula. The physical examination findings are mostly not assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels. Troponin T levels are within normal range. The patient's platelet count is within normal range, as well as electrolyte levels. Other lab results are provided in the flow sheet. The patient is on prophylactic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's code status is discussed, but no specific information is provided"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension, was admitted with dyspnea over the last 4 months. Upon evaluation, bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) was found, and a trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed signs of mild right heart strain. The patient is hemodynamically stable and not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. Heparin drip has been continued, and Coumadin has been increased to 6.0 with an INR of 4.0.

The patient also complained of chest discomfort while eating, which resolved within minutes. An EKG showed lateral T wave flattening, but lead placement may have been different from prior EKGs. Cardiac enzymes were cycled, and a repeat EKG was ordered.

The patient sounds wheezy and is likely experiencing a COPD exacerbation component to respiratory distress. Solumedrol was given for 3 days, and Prednisone taper has been initiated. Nebulizers with fluticasone and ipratropium were prescribed q6hr standing, and xopinex was ordered q4h PRN.

A TTE revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and right heart strain. The patient reported symptoms of orthopnea, which may be related to acute PE"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presents with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on therapeutic Coumadin and remains supratherapeutic with an INR of 4.0. He also has a history of COPD exacerbation, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial tachycardia, chest pain, troponin leak, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, hypertension, insomnia, arthritis pain, and family considerations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) - The patient has a history of PE, which can be a life-threatening condition if not managed properly.
2. COPD exacerbation - The patient's COPD exacerbation may worsen due to respiratory distress and could lead to respiratory failure.
3. Congestive heart failure (CHF) - The patient has signs of right heart strain, and his symptoms of orthopnea may be related to acute PE or CHF. Fluid overload is also evident on CXR.
4. Atrial tachycardia - The patient has an atrial tachycardia, which can increase the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications.
5. Chest pain - Although the chest pain has"

The patient is currently being treated with therapeutic Coumadin, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is at target. The decision to stop heparin drip and not place an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was made because the patient is hemodynamically stable. 

The patient's COPD exacerbation is being managed with inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone and ipratropium), short-acting bronchodilators (xopinex), and systemic corticosteroids (Solumedrol and prednisone). 

The patient has evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% and right heart strain on TTE. He reports symptoms of orthopnea, but this may be related to acute PE. His brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated, and his chest X-ray suggests fluid overload. The patient received one dose of intravenous lasix with good results and has a negative fluid balance.

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock. The patient's current condition shows improvement with a body weight of 72.4 kg, which is an increase from the admission weight of 68.1 kg. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate ranging from 87 to 110 bpm, blood pressure between 119/73 mmHg and 131/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,759 mL and a total output of 2,260 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 501 mL. The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen and has been on respiratory support.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 25.1 to 26.3 thousand/mm³. The patient's hemoglobin levels are within normal range, with a mean corpuscular volume of 42.1%. The platelet count is slightly low at 125-166 thousand/mm³. Renal function tests show normal creatinine levels, but there is a slight elevation in blood urea nitrogen. Liver function tests are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated troponin-T level.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - Stop Heparin drip, does not need IVC filter.
   - Coumadin increased to 6.0 yesterday, INR today 4.0
   - Would hold Coumadin today and give 5 or 6 tomorrow pending AM INR
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
   -          Solumedrol 125mg Q8h x3 days. Yesterday  was day 3 of 3
   -          d/c Solumedrol today and begin Prednisone taper. 60 mg X 2
   days and then decrease by 10 daily.
   -          Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
   -          On xopinex q4h PRN
   -          Completed course of azithromycin
   -          HISS while on steroids
   -          PO PPI while on steroids
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior. 1x
   10IV lasix yesterday with good results, now LOS net negative.
   - Hold further diuresis other than chlorthalidone given returning ARF
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Atrial tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior
   EKG for comparison. Had 12 beat run of V-Tach on [**3-13**].  Transitioned
   from diltiazem to betablocker.
   - Continue Atenolol 50mg daily
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   #Chest Pain:  pt. complained of some chest discomfort while eating, now
   resolved within minutes.  Substernal, nonradiating.  EKG showed some
   lateral T wave flattening, although lead placement may have been
   different from prior EKGs.  Unlikely
   -          Pt ruled out for MI yesterday
   -          Chest pain free since yesterday AM
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD.
   - Pt [**Name (NI) **] yesterday
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: Originally presented with Cr 1.3 vs baseline 10
   likely pre-renal [**1-25**] poor PO intake, resumed to baseline with fluids,
   now back to 1.3 in setting of resent lasix and net negative balance.
   - repeat urine lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presented with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed signs of mild right heart strain. The patient is hemodynamically stable and not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. He is now on therapeutic Coumadin.

The patient also has a COPD exacerbation, for which he was given Solu-Medrol and is now being tapered off with Prednisone. He is also receiving nebulizer treatments with fluticasone and ipratropium every 6 hours, as well as xopinex every 4 hours as needed.

Additionally, the patient has congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40% and evidence of right heart strain. He complains of orthopnea, but this may be related to the acute PE. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, and his chest X-ray shows signs of fluid overload. He received one dose of intravenous Lasix yesterday with good results.

The patient experienced an episode of atrial tachycardia, which could be atrial fibrillation or multifocal atrial"

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemia and an acute exacerbation of COPD. He also has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen, prednisone, and nebulizers for his COPD. His tachycardia and atrial fibrillation are being treated with atenolol. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 118/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals symmetric chest expansion, rhonchi in the left lung base, and no lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 25.1 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 40.7% to 42.1%, normal platelet count (Plt), and slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 1.0 to 1.3 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes, glucose levels, and cardiac markers, are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - INR today 2.0 this AM, currently therapeutic
   - Check INR at noon, if subtherapeutic will consider heparin.
   - Resume Coumadin 5mg Qhs
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    - Prednisone Taper: s/p 2 days on 60 mg, decrease to 50mg QD today and
   decrease by 10 daily
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Completed course of azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior EKG
   for comparison. Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of
   tachycardia. Tachycardia overnight may have been secondary to
   respiratory distress (as face mask was off at time), perhaps not helped
   by arthritis pain and overall deconditioning (becomes more tachycardic
   with activity).
   - Increase Atenolol to 75 mg daily
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
mild this AM to 132, formerly at 123 at 2:30am. Patient
   endorses thirst and somewhat dry on exam. Will likely self-correct
   - Will check PM lytes; if Na continues to be low will consider small,
   200cc fluid bolus.
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Hold further diuresis other than chlorthalidone given returning ARF
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure:  Creatinine 0.9
   - resolved
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: continue atenolol, dose increased in setting of
   tachycardia.
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   #Arthritis pain
   - PRN oxycodone for pain control
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low regular diet

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presented with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on therapeutic Coumadin and is hemodynamically stable. He also has signs of mild right heart strain on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). 

The patient's recent events include an increased oxygen requirement while eating yesterday evening, tachycardia, and mild hypoxemia. These symptoms may suggest a possible COPD exacerbation component to respiratory distress. The patient has been treated with prednisone taper, standing nebs (fluticasone and ipratropium q6hr), xopinex q4h PRN, and completed a course of azithromycin.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/84 to 124/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% face mask and 6L nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The physical examination reveals an irregular rhythm with a slightly tachycardic heart rate in the low 100s, no murmurs, rub"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presents with dyspnea for the last four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and is being treated with Coumadin. His INR is therapeutic at 2.0. He is also experiencing a COPD exacerbation, which is contributing to his respiratory distress. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL with signs of mild right heart strain. The patient is not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. He will continue therapeutic dosing of Coumadin.
2. COPD exacerbation - the patient sounds wheezy and has likely developed a COPD exacerbation as part of his respiratory distress.
   - Prednisone taper: decrease to 50 mg daily today and decrease by 10 daily.
   - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing.

   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - INR today 2.0 this AM, currently therapeutic
   - Resume Coumadin 5mg Qhs
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    - Prednisone Taper: s/p 2 days on 60 mg, decrease to 50mg QD today and
   decrease by 10 daily
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Completed course of azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior EKG
   for comparison. Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of
   tachycardia. Tachycardia overnight may have been secondary to
   respiratory distress (as face mask was off)
   - Increase Atenolol to 75 mg daily
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
mild this AM to 132.
   - QD lytes
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Hold further diuresis other than chlorthalidone given returning ARF
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   #Chest Pain:  pt. complained of some chest discomfort while eating, now
   resolved within minutes.  Substernal, nonradiating.  EKG showed some
   lateral T wave flattening, although lead placement may have been
   different from prior EKGs.  Unlikely
   -          Pt ruled out for MI yesterday
   -          Chest pain free since yesterday AM
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD.
   - Pt [**Name (NI) **] yesterday

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension.
- He presented with dyspnea over the last four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient is currently on Coumadin for the PE, with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0, which is therapeutic.
- He is also experiencing a COPD exacerbation, likely contributing to his respiratory distress.
- His heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF), and his beta-blocker dose has been increased to 75 mg daily due to tachycardia.
- The patient has mild hyponatremia with a sodium level of 132.
- He has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% and right heart strain.
- There is evidence of fluid overload on the chest X-ray.
- The patient complained of chest discomfort while eating, which resolved within minutes and is unlikely to be a myocardial infarction (MI).
- He has troponin leak due to right heart strain from the underlying PE.
- The patient also has acute renal failure, which has since resolved.
- He has leukocytosis with a baseline"

    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior EKG
   for comparison. Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of
   tachycardia. Tachycardia overnight may have been secondary to
   respiratory distress (as face mask was off at time), perhaps not helped
   by arthritis pain and overall deconditioning (becomes more tachycardic
   with activity).
   - Lopressor 25 QID today. Check HR and titrate as necessary.
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
mild this AM to 132, formerly at 123 at 2:30am. Patient
   endorses thirst and somewhat dry on exam. Will likely self-correct
   - Check PM lytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presents with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). He is currently on therapeutic Coumadin and is hemodynamically stable. The patient also has a history of a mild right heart strain on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) but is not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. He is experiencing a COPD exacerbation, likely due to his respiratory distress. His tachycardia may be secondary to the respiratory distress or overall deconditioning. He has mild hyponatremia, which is expected to self-correct. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, indicating possible congestive heart failure (CHF). He has minimal edema and no significant elevation in his chest X-ray. His troponin levels are within normal range, suggesting no acute coronary syndrome. His acute renal failure has resolved, and he has leukocytosis due to CLL. He also has hypertension and arthritis pain. The patient is being considered for rehabilitation prior to discharge due to continued oxygen requirement. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute PE: The patient's bilateral PE indicates a serious and life-threatening condition that can lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - INR today 2.0 this AM, currently therapeutic
   - Resume Coumadin 5mg Qhs, f/u INR tomorrow
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    - Prednisone Taper: s/p 2 days on 60 mg, decrease to 40mg QD today and
   decrease by 10 daily
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Completed course of azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior EKG
   for comparison. Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of
   tachycardia. Tachycardia overnight may have been secondary to
   respiratory distress (as face mask was off at time), perhaps not helped
   by arthritis pain and overall deconditioning (becomes more tachycardic
   with activity).
   - Lopressor 25 QID today. Check HR and titrate as necessary.
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
mild this AM to 132, formerly at 123 at 2:30am. Patient
   endorses thirst and somewhat dry on exam. Will likely self-correct
   - Check PM lytes
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Resumed standing chlorthalidone dose (temporarily held in setting of
   ARF)
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: resolved
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: continue atenolol, dose increased in setting of
   tachycardia.
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   #Arthritis pain
   - PRN oxycodone for pain control
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: coumadin, PPI
   # Access: peripherals:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension (HTN). He presents with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Assessment and Plan:
1. PE: The patient likely has an acute-on-chronic PE in the setting of CLL. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed signs of mild right heart strain. He is hemodynamically stable and not a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) or thrombectomy. He is currently on therapeutic Coumadin, and his INR is within the therapeutic range. The plan is to resume Coumadin 5mg QHS and follow up with an INR tomorrow. The patient will likely need rehabilitation prior to discharge due to continued oxygen requirement. A physical therapy consult has been requested.

2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient sounds wheezy, likely indicating a COPD exacerbation component to respiratory distress. The plan includes a prednisone taper, standing nebulizers with fluticasone and ipratropium q6hr, xopinex q4h PRN, completed course of azithromycin, HISS while on steroids, and PO PPI while on steroids.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presents with dyspnea over the last four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The assessment and plan include:
1. PE: The patient is likely to have acute-on-chronic PE in the setting of CLL. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed signs of mild right heart strain. The patient is hemodynamically stable, so he is not a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) or thrombectomy. He is currently therapeutic on Coumadin. The INR today is 2.0, which is within the therapeutic range. The plan is to check the INR at noon and consider heparin if it is subtherapeutic. The patient will resume Coumadin at 5 mg QHS. A physical therapy consult has been requested as the patient will likely need rehabilitation prior to discharge due to continued oxygen requirement.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient sounds wheezy, likely due to a COPD exacerbation component in the respiratory distress. The plan includes prednisone tapering from 60 mg to 50 mg QD today and decreasing by 10 daily. The patient will continue to use fluticasone and ip"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He is currently in the ICU for ongoing tachycardia and hypoxemia. The patient has a past medical history of pulmonary embolism (PE), acute atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). 

24-hour events include an increase in oxygen requirement, ongoing tachycardia in the 120s-140s range, and no fever. The patient feels well in the morning but has been staying in the ICU due to his condition. Allergies are not reported, and the patient has received antibiotics and pantoprazole infusions. Review of systems shows tachycardia and respiratory issues, but no dyspnea or pain. 

Flowsheet data indicates that the patient's temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate are within normal limits, although the heart rhythm is AFib. The patient's weight has increased from admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1630 mL and output of 2430 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 800 mL. Oxygen delivery is through a nasal cannula, and the SpO2 level is at 94%. ABG results are not provided.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - INR today 1.4 this AM down from supra-therapeutic levels yesterday
   - Resume Coumadin 5mg QHS
   - restart heparin gtt as bridge
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   # COPD exacerbation: much improved. Likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    - Prednisone Taper: s/p 2 days on 60 mg, decrease to 40mg QD today and
   decrease by 10 daily
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Completed course of azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior EKG
   for comparison. Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of
   tachycardia. Tachycardia overnight may have been secondary to
   respiratory distress (as face mask was off at time), perhaps not helped
   by arthritis pain and overall deconditioning (becomes more tachycardic
   with activity).
   - Lopressor 25 QID today. Check HR and titrate as necessary.
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
mild this AM to 131 from 132 yesterday, formerly at 123
   at 2:30am. Patient endorses thirst and somewhat dry on exam. Will
   likely self-correct
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Resumed standing chlorthalidone dose (temporarily held in setting of
   ARF)
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presented with dyspnea over the last four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on Coumadin for anticoagulation, with an INR target of 2-3. He has signs of mild right heart strain on echocardiogram but is hemodynamically stable.

The patient also has an ongoing COPD exacerbation, which has improved but may contribute to respiratory distress. His current medications include prednisone for tapering, fluticasone and ipratropium nebs q6hr, xopinex q4h PRN, and azithromycin completed.

He has tachycardia, possibly atrial fibrillation (A-fib) or multifocal atrial tachycardia. His atenolol dose has been increased to 75mg QD. He will require telemetry on the floor.

The patient has mild hyponatremia, which is likely to self-correct. His CHF assessment shows a TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain, along with orthopnea. He has minimal edema, but his chest X-ray appears more fluid overloaded than before. He is resumed on standing chlorthalidone, continues beta"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - INR today 1.4 this AM down from supra-therapeutic levels yesterday
   - Resume Coumadin 5mg QHS
   - restart heparin gtt as bridge, follow PTT
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   # COPD exacerbation: much improved. Likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    - Prednisone Taper: s/p 2 days on 60 mg, decrease to 40mg QD today and
   decrease by 10 q4d
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Completed course of azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Tachycardia: A-fib (not as likely multifocal atrial tachycardia).
   Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of tachycardia and then
   switched to metoprolol q6h. Still tachycardic.
   - Lopressor increase from 50 QID to 75 QID. Check HR and titrate as
   necessary.
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
mild this AM to 131 from 132 yesterday, formerly at 123
   at 2:30am. Patient endorses thirst and somewhat dry on exam. Will
   likely self-correct.
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Resumed standing chlorthalidone dose (temporarily held in setting of
   ARF)
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: resolved
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: continue atenolol, dose increased in setting of
   tachycardia.
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   #Arthritis pain
   - PRN oxycodone for pain control

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and hypertension.
- He presented with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and is being treated with Coumadin (warfarin) for anticoagulation.
- His COPD exacerbation has improved, and he is being weaned off steroids.
- He has atrial fibrillation (A-fib) with a rapid heart rate, which has not responded to beta-blockers.
- The patient has mild hyponatremia, which is likely to self-correct.
- He has evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) with a reduced ejection fraction of 40% and right heart strain.
- His troponin levels are elevated due to right heart strain from the underlying PE.
- The patient had acute renal failure, but it has resolved.
- He has leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count, which is likely due to his CLL.
- His hypertension is being managed with atenolol.
- The patient also has insomnia and arthritis pain, for which he is receiving appropriate medications.

   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - INR today 1.4 this AM down from supra-therapeutic levels yesterday
   - Resume Coumadin 5mg QHS
   - restart heparin gtt as bridge
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   # COPD exacerbation
patient sounds wheezy, likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    - Prednisone Taper: s/p 2 days on 60 mg, decrease to 40mg QD today and
   decrease by 10 daily
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Completed course of azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior EKG
   for comparison. Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of
   tachycardia. Tachycardia overnight may have been secondary to
   respiratory distress (as face mask was off at time), perhaps not helped
   by arthritis pain and overall deconditioning (becomes more tachycardic
   with activity).
   - Lopressor 25 QID today. Check HR and titrate as necessary.
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
mild this AM to 131 from 132 yesterday, formerly at 123
   at 2:30am. Patient endorses thirst and somewhat dry on exam. Will
   likely self-correct
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Resumed standing chlorthalidone dose (temporarily held in setting of
   ARF)
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: resolved
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: continue atenolol, dose increased in setting of
   tachycardia.
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   #Arthritis pain
   - PRN oxycodone for pain control
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presents with dyspnea for the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on therapeutic dosages of Coumadin and has an INR of 1.4. He is also on beta-blockers and will need rehabilitation prior to discharge due to continued oxygen requirement. 

The patient is experiencing a COPD exacerbation with wheezing, likely contributing to respiratory distress. Prednisone tapering is being implemented, along with nebulizer treatments and xopinex as needed. 

The patient is diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or multifocal atrial tachycardia. Atenolol dosage has been increased to 75mg QD, and Lopressor 25 QID has been initiated. Telemetry will be required on the floor.

Hyponatremia has been observed, but it is expected to self-correct. 

The patient's echocardiogram shows a 40% ejection fraction and signs of right heart strain. He reports symptoms of orthopnea, which may be related to acute PE. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, and there is minimal edema on examination. Chlorthalidone has been"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presented with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on therapeutic doses of Coumadin and has an INR of 1.4. He is also being treated for a COPD exacerbation, which has improved significantly. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and his heart rate remains elevated despite increasing the dose of atenolol and switching to metoprolol. He continues to have episodes of tachycardia and requires close monitoring. The patient's sodium levels are mildly low, but it is expected to self-correct. He has symptoms of orthopnea, which could be related to an acute PE or heart failure. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, indicating possible heart failure. He has minimal edema on examination, but his chest X-ray shows signs of fluid overload. The patient's troponin levels are within normal limits, suggesting no acute coronary syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - INR today 1.4 this AM down from supra-therapeutic levels yesterday
   - Resume Coumadin 5mg QHS
   - restart heparin gtt as bridge
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   # COPD exacerbation: much improved. Likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    - Prednisone Taper: s/p 2 days on 60 mg, decrease to 40mg QD today and
   decrease by 10 daily
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Completed course of azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Tachycardia: A-fib vs. multifocal atrial tachycardia. No prior EKG
   for comparison. Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of
   tachycardia. Tachycardia overnight may have been secondary to
   respiratory distress (as face mask was off at time), perhaps not helped
   by arthritis pain and overall deconditioning (becomes more tachycardic
   with activity).
   - Lopressor 25 QID today. Check HR and titrate as necessary.
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
mild this AM to 131 from 132 yesterday, formerly at 123
   at 2:30am. Patient endorses thirst and somewhat dry on exam. Will
   likely self-correct
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Resumed standing chlorthalidone dose (temporarily held in setting of
   ARF)
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: resolved
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: continue atenolol, dose increased in setting of
   tachycardia.
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   #Arthritis pain
   - PRN oxycodone for pain control
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: coumadin, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presented with dyspnea over the last four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on therapeutic doses of Coumadin and has signs of mild right heart strain on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). He is hemodynamically stable and not a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) or thrombectomy.

Assessment and Plan:
1. PE: The patient has acute-on-chronic PE in the setting of CLL. He is on therapeutic doses of Coumadin and shows signs of mild right heart strain on TTE. He is hemodynamically stable, so he will not receive TPA or thrombectomy. He will continue with Coumadin and restart heparin as a bridge. The patient will likely need rehabilitation prior to discharge due to continued O2 requirement. A physical therapy consult has been requested.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation has improved, but he may still have a component of respiratory distress due to COPD. He will receive a tapering dose of prednisone, standing nebs with fluticasone and ipratropium every six hours, xopinex every four hours as needed, completed course of azith"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of increased beta-blocker dose to lower heart rate, which was successful but resulted in low blood pressures. The patient's breathing has improved with bolusing and is currently on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient is awake, alert, and appropriate.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), a heart rate of 96 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 101/77 mmHg to 120/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's weight has increased from 68.1 kg to 72.4 kg since admission.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,590 mL total, including 240 mL of PO and 500 mL of IVF, with an output of 2,470 mL total, including 1,270 mL of urine. The patient has trace dependent edema.

The patient is receiving several medications, including pantoprazole, Coumadin (warfarin), and other ICU medications. The patient's allergies are unknown.

Physical examination reveals an irregular rhythm, slightly tachycardic heart rate, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, bibasilar crackles in the lungs, a soft and non-tender abdomen with positive bowel sounds, warm and well-perfused extremities, and trace dependent edema.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The creatinine levels are within normal range, and troponin-T is below detection limit. Other lab values are mostly within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures have been low, indicating a risk of hypotension.
2. Respiratory issues: The patient's prolonged expiratory phase and bibasilar crackles may indicate underlying respiratory issues, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility in the ICU.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis, indicating a potential risk for stress ulcers.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to mechanical ventilation.
7. Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR and PT/PTT suggest an increased risk of bleeding.

It is important to monitor these potential complications closely and take appropriate measures to prevent or manage them."

His blood pressures have been low, so he was bolused with fluids which improved his condition. His breathing has been well, and he is currently on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. He is receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, warfarin for anticoagulation, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), a heart rate of 96 bpm (with a range of 93-134 bpm), a blood pressure of 101/77 mmHg (with a range of 82-120/49-100 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (with a range of 14-34 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 95%. He is still in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 15.9 to 27.6 thousand cells per microliter, a hematocrit ranging from 40.7% to 45.8%, a platelet count ranging from 117 to "

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - INR today 2.7
   - continue Coumadin 5mg QHS
   - stop heparin gtt as INR therapeutic.
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure  - considered HAP and COPD exacerbation
   as contributing factors.
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - reduce midazolam sedation
   - Transition to pressure support as tolerated
   # COPD exacerbation: much improved. Likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    - Prednisone Taper: s/p 2 days on 60 mg, decrease to 40mg QD today and
   decrease by 10 q4d
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Completed course of azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Fever
   - send cultures
   - Check LFTs, Lipase
   - Send CBC with differential
   - Send C. Diff
   # Tachycardia: A-fib (not as likely multifocal atrial tachycardia).
   Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of tachycardia and then
   switched to metoprolol q6h. Still tachycardic.
   - Lopressor  change to 75 q 8 hours. Check HR and titrate as necessary.
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
mild this AM to 131 from 132 yesterday, formerly at 123
   at 2:30am. Patient endorses thirst and somewhat dry on exam. Will
   likely self-correct.
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Hold chlorthalidone dose (hold all diuretics in attempt to wean from
   pressors)
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   - No Lasix for today
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - Change to 81 mg  ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: resolved
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Currently on vasopressors.
   - continue atenolol, dose increased in setting of tachycardia.
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   #Arthritis pain
   - PRN oxycodone for pain control
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, Begin TFs today (hold at midnight)
   # Prophylaxis: coumadin, PPI (prevacid IV)
   # Access: peripherals, CVL

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient presented with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The PE is likely acute on chronic in the setting of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The patient's TTE shows signs of mild right heart strain but is hemodynamically stable, so he is not a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) or thrombectomy. He is being therapeutic on Coumadin, and his INR is currently 2.7. The heparin infusion will be stopped as the INR is therapeutic.

- The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O, and compliance of 62.5 mL/cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 98%.

- The patient also has a COPD exacerbation, which has improved. He will be tapered off prednisone, and his nebulizer treatments will include fluticasone and iprat"

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 64-155 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 77/51 to 134/82 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF), and they have gained weight since admission.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 1,502 mL of fluids, with 179 mL being given over the past 24 hours. The patient has also received 875 mL of blood products and 557 mL of urine output. The net fluid balance is 627 mL positive.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 392, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 28.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 27.2 thousand cells/microliter, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 42.4%, platelet count (Plt) of 126 thousand cells/microliter, and creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has multiple lines inserted, including arterial and venous access. They are receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, infection due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, bleeding from the use of anticoagulant therapy (heparin), and kidney dysfunction indicated by the elevated creatinine level. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory values will be necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now therapeutic on Coumadin.
   - INR today 1.4 this AM down from supra-therapeutic levels yesterday
   - Resume Coumadin 5mg QHS
   - restart heparin gtt as bridge, follow PTT
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested

   # Tachycardia: A-fib (not as likely multifocal atrial tachycardia).
   Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of tachycardia and then
   switched to metoprolol q6h. Still tachycardic.
   - Lopressor increase from 50 QID to 75 QID. Check HR and titrate as
   necessary.
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
mild this AM to 131 from 132 yesterday, formerly at 123
   at 2:30am. Patient endorses thirst and somewhat dry on exam. Will
   likely self-correct.
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Resumed standing chlorthalidone dose (temporarily held in setting of
   ARF)
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - FS ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: resolved
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: continue atenolol, dose increased in setting of
   tachycardia.
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   #Arthritis pain
   - PRN oxycodone for pain control
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 68-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension, presented with dyspnea over the last four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs show an increased heart rate (92 bpm) and a slightly elevated temperature (Tmax: 38.6 C). The patient's blood pressure is within normal range (BP: 134/82 mmHg). The patient's respiratory rate is controlled at 20 breaths per minute with the assistance of the ventilator. Oxygen saturation remains at 98% on FiO2 50%. The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response. The patient's weight has increased from 68.1 kg at admission to 72.4 kg currently. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,502 mL and output of 875 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 627 mL. The patient has received several medications, including heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam, and phenylephrine. The patient's laboratory results indicate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient initially presented with dyspnea and was found to have bilateral PE. Although some resolution of PE is seen on the CT scan, the patient remains on Coumadin for therapeutic anticoagulation.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia) and COPD exacerbation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a reduced tidal volume and pressure support as tolerated.

3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing an exacerbation. The patient is receiving bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics as part of the management plan.

4. Fever: The patient has a fever, and cultures have been sent. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause of the fever.

5. Tachycardia: The patient is tachycardic and has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Despite medication adjustments, the patient remains tachycardic, and telemetry monitoring will continue on the floor.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient has mild hyponatremia, which is expected to self-correct. It is important to monitor the patient's sodium levels and adjust treatment accordingly.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. The patient presented with dyspnea over the last four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure, suspected to be caused by a combination of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and COPD exacerbation. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate 99 bpm (with atrial fibrillation), blood pressure 121/73 mmHg, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 93% on supplemental oxygen, and central venous pressure (CVP) 15 mmHg. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated in a hepatocellular injury pattern, which is concerning for potential liver damage. Other lab results include elevated troponin levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal electrolyte levels such as hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia.

The patient has been treated with various medications including antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime), sedatives (propofol and midazolam), anticoagulant"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now supratherapeutic on Coumadin with INR 7.3
   - INR today 7.3
   - Hold coumadin Coumadin for now. Repeat INR in PM and consider small
   dose vitamin K at that time if more elevated.
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure  - considered HAP and COPD exacerbation
   as contributing factors.
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - reduce midazolam sedation
   - Patient tolerating PSV 5/5 well with RSBI 11.
   # COPD exacerbation: much improved. Likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    - Prednisone Taper: Continue 40mg QD today and decrease by 10 q4d
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN

   # Tachycardia: A-fib (not as likely multifocal atrial tachycardia).
   Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of tachycardia and then
   switched to metoprolol q6h. Still tachycardic.
   - Lopressor  change to 75 q 8 hours. Check HR and titrate as necessary.
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
 appears to be self correcting, today with sodium of
   136.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Hold chlorthalidone dose (hold all diuretics in attempt to wean from
   pressors)
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   - No Lasix for today
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - Change to 81 mg  ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: resolved
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Currently on vasopressors.
   - continue atenolol, dose increased in setting of tachycardia.
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. The patient presented with dyspnea over the last 4 months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of acute renal failure suggest a risk of AKI. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to COPD exacerbation and HAP, requires continued respiratory support. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.

3. Hepatic injury: The elevated liver function tests (LFTs) indicate hepatocellular injury. Further investigation through imaging studies, such as the RUQ ultrasound, is warranted to identify the cause.

4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and signs of right heart strain on echocardiogram suggest potential cardiac issues. Tachycardia management and close monitoring for arrhythmias are necessary.

5. Fluid overload: The patient's elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and signs of orthopnea indicate fluid overload"

   FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormalities.
   The
   main portal vein is patent with appropriate hepatopetal flow. There is
   no
   intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with the common bile duct
   measuring
   up to 5 mm. The pancreas is unremarkable. The spleen is unremarkable in
   appearance, though borderline in size measuring up to 12.4 cm. The
   gallbladder is normal without evidence of cholelithiasis. Note is made
   of a
   prominent IVC, and trace amount of intra-abdominal ascites and a right
   pleural
   effusion. There is extensive atherosclerotic calcification noted within
   the
   visualized portions of the abdominal aorta with no areas of focal
   aneurysmal
   dilation. Both kidneys are unremarkable with no evidence of
   hydronephrosis,
   nephrolithiasis, or discrete masses.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No focal or textural abnormality of the liver. Right-sided effusion,
   ascites, and prominence of the IVC suggest passive congestion as source
   of
   hepatopathy.
   2. Borderline splenomegaly with spleen measuring 12.4 cm.
   3. Note is made of extensive atherosclerotic calcification within the
   abdominal aorta.
   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure  - considered HAP and COPD exacerbation
   as contributing factors. Currently doing well.
   -          continue vanc/cefepime
   -          PICC placement today to complete course at rehab if needed
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now supratherapeutic on Coumadin with INR 4.5
   - Holding  Coumadin given supratherapeutic INR (will restart 3 mg for
   INR < 2.5)
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   - Check PM INR given vitamin K yesterday
   # COPD exacerbation/PNA: much improved. Likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    -. Steroid taper - Starting prednisone 40mg PO today (got Solumedrol
   80mg/60mg yesterday); taper over ~10 days
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Now s/p azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
 increase PRN for better glycemic control
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Episode of rapid ventricular rate overnight
   responded to metoprolol 10mg IV. RVR may be influenced by volume
   overload/hepatic congestion.
   - continue telemetry
   - continue metoprolol 75 mg Q8 and uptitrate to goal resting heart rate
   <110 (will monitor over the course of the day)
   - supratherapeutic INR, so holding coumadin for anticoagulation
   # Transaminitis
 LFTs found to be elevated in hepatocellular injury
   pattern likely due to passive congestion
   # Fever
 afebrile for 24 hours.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u C. Diff
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Resume chlorthalidone
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   - No Lasix for today
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - Change to 81 mg  ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Hyponatremia
self correcting, today with sodium of 137.
   # Acute renal failure: resolved
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Currently on vasopressors.
   -          continue atenolol, dose increased in setting of tachycardia.
   -          restart home chlorthalidone
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   #Arthritis pain
   - PRN oxycodone for pain control
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, advance diet today
   # Prophylaxis: supratherapeutic INR, PPI (prevacid IV), PT consult
   today for increased activity
   # Access: peripherals, CVL (will pull today and place PICC)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CLL, COPD, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea and found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently extubated and tolerating a nasal cannula. He experienced tachycardia, specifically atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which responded to metoprolol IV. The patient also had a supratherapeutic INR of 12.9 and received oral vitamin K.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate in the 110s-120s bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/73 mmHg to 132/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 69.6 kg, and his height is 71 inches.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's physical examination reveals opacified right cornea, clear lungs, firm abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, irregular rhythm with normal rate, and no edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (44.8 K/uL), hematocrit (43.2%), platelet count (159 K/uL), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 338/153). Other lab"

   STUDIES:

   FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormalities.
   The
   main portal vein is patent with appropriate hepatopetal flow. There is
   no
   intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with the common bile duct
   measuring
   up to 5 mm. The pancreas is unremarkable. The spleen is unremarkable in
   appearance, though borderline in size measuring up to 12.4 cm. The
   gallbladder is normal without evidence of cholelithiasis. Note is made
   of a
   prominent IVC, and trace amount of intra-abdominal ascites and a right
   pleural
   effusion. There is extensive atherosclerotic calcification noted within
   the
   visualized portions of the abdominal aorta with no areas of focal
   aneurysmal
   dilation. Both kidneys are unremarkable with no evidence of
   hydronephrosis,
   nephrolithiasis, or discrete masses.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No focal or textural abnormality of the liver. Right-sided effusion,
   ascites, and prominence of the IVC suggest passive congestion as source
   of
   hepatopathy.
   2. Borderline splenomegaly with spleen measuring 12.4 cm.
   3. Note is made of extensive atherosclerotic calcification within the
   abdominal aorta.
   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure  - considered HAP and COPD exacerbation
   as contributing factors.
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now supratherapeutic on Coumadin with INR 4.5
   - Hold  Coumadin given supratherapeutic INR
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   # COPD exacerbation/PNA: much improved. Likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    -. Steroid taper - Starting prednisone 40mg PO today (got Solumedrol
   80mg/60mg yesterday)
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Now s/p azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Episode of rapid ventricular rate overnight
   responded to metoprolol 10mg IV.
   - continue telemetry
   - continue metoprolol 75mg Q8 and uptitrate to goal resting heart rate
   <110
   - supratherapeutic INR, so holding coumadin for anticoagulation
   # Transaminitis
 LFTs found to be elevated in hepatocellular injury
   pattern likely due to passive congestion
   # Fever

   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Hold chlorthalidone dose (hold all diuretics in attempt to wean from
   pressors)
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   - No Lasix for today
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - Change to 81 mg  ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He presents with dyspnea over the last four months and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). He is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, suspected to be due to a combination of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and COPD exacerbation. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is experiencing several complications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate in the range of 84-120 beats per minute with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 110/73 mmHg to 132/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of being on Coumadin for anticoagulation, but his INR is currently supratherapeutic at 12.9, so it has been held. He has also been given Vitamin K orally.

The patient has been extubated and is tolerating a nasal cannula. He experienced tachycardia and received Metoprolol 10mg IV, which helped control his heart rate. He also received antibiotics for suspected infection, including Vancomycin and Cefepime.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient required invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated and now tolerating nasal cannula oxygen. The patient experienced tachycardia, specifically atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and received metoprolol 10mg IV to control heart rate. The patient also had a supratherapeutic INR of 12.9 and received 5mg Vitamin K orally.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's high INR indicates a potential bleeding risk due to anticoagulation therapy. This can lead to spontaneous bleeding or increased bleeding during procedures.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating dehydration. Electrolyte imbalances can occur due to fluid shifts or renal dysfunction.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient's heart rhythm remains in AFib, which can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiac complications.
5. Hypoxemia: Despite being on supplemental oxygen, the patient still has low oxygen levels, indicating inadequate oxygenation. This may require"

   FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormalities.
   The
   main portal vein is patent with appropriate hepatopetal flow. There is
   no
   intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with the common bile duct
   measuring
   up to 5 mm. The pancreas is unremarkable. The spleen is unremarkable in
   appearance, though borderline in size measuring up to 12.4 cm. The
   gallbladder is normal without evidence of cholelithiasis. Note is made
   of a
   prominent IVC, and trace amount of intra-abdominal ascites and a right
   pleural
   effusion. There is extensive atherosclerotic calcification noted within
   the
   visualized portions of the abdominal aorta with no areas of focal
   aneurysmal
   dilation. Both kidneys are unremarkable with no evidence of
   hydronephrosis,
   nephrolithiasis, or discrete masses.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No focal or textural abnormality of the liver. Right-sided effusion,
   ascites, and prominence of the IVC suggest passive congestion as source
   of
   hepatopathy.
   2. Borderline splenomegaly with spleen measuring 12.4 cm.
   3. Note is made of extensive atherosclerotic calcification within the
   abdominal aorta.
   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with
   dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure  - considered HAP and COPD exacerbation
   as contributing factors.
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - reduce midazolam sedation
   - Patient tolerating PSV 5/5 well with RSBI 11.
   # PE: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL. TTE with signs
   of mild right heart strain. Hemodynamically stable so not candidate for
   TPA or thrombectomy. Now supratherapeutic on Coumadin with INR 4.5
   - INR today 7.3
   - Hold  Coumadin given .
   - Per case management, patient will likely need rehab prior to
   discharge given continued O2 requirement. PT consult requested
   # COPD exacerbation/PNA: much improved. Likely has COPD exacerbation
   component to respiratory distress
    - Solumedrol 80mg/60mg for today
s remaining doses. Will then start
   prednisone 4mg PO daily starting tomorrow and taper
    - Standing nebs: fluticasone, ipratropium q6hr standing
    - on xopinex q4h PRN
    - Now s/p azithromycin
    - HISS while on steroids
    - PO PPI while on steroids
   # Fever
 afebrile for 24 hours.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u C. Diff
   # Transaminitis
 LFTs found to be elevated in hepatocellular injury
   pattern.
   - will obtain RUQ u/s today
   # Tachycardia: A-fib (not as likely multifocal atrial tachycardia).
   Atenolol dose increased to 75mg QD in setting of tachycardia and then
   switched to metoprolol q6h. Still tachycardic.
   - Lopressor  change to 75 q 8 hours. Check HR and titrate as necessary.
   - Will need telemetry on floor.
   # Hyponatremia
 appears to be self correcting, today with sodium of
   136.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   # CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain. Patient endorses
   symptoms of orthopnea, but may be related to acute PE. BNP elevated but
   no prior levels for comparison. Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6681**]
   elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
   - Hold chlorthalidone dose (hold all diuretics in attempt to wean from
   pressors)
   - Continue beta-blockers at current level
   - Consider ace-i in the future
   - No Lasix for today
   # Troponin leak: Likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
   EKG was TWis, but no baseline to compare. No known underlying CAD. Pt
   ruled out. No chest pain
   - Change to 81 mg  ASA
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: resolved
   # Leukocytosis: Baseline WBC 25-30 in setting of CLL. Afebrile, and
   unlikely infected.
   - Trend CBC daily
   # Hypertension: Currently on vasopressors.
   - continue atenolol, dose increased in setting of tachycardia.
   #Insomnia
   - Continue Trazodone 25 mg qHS
   #Arthritis pain
   - PRN oxycodone for pain control
   # Family considerations: SW c/s in Am given patient is primary
   caretaker for wife.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, Begin TFs today (hold at midnight)
   # Prophylaxis: supratherapeutic INR, PPI (prevacid IV)
   # Access: peripherals, CVL
