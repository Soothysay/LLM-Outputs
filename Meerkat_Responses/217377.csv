","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of CABG, CVA, and bilateral carotid artery disease who presented for right carotid stenting. He is currently in the ICU following the procedure. The patient has been enrolled in a study to monitor early clinical outcomes data for the Wallstent and FilterWire EZ. During the procedure, he experienced a vagal reaction that required atropine and his blood pressure increased to the 200s, necessitating a nitro drip. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 43 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/43-108/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has left-sided crackles at the bases but no other significant abnormalities on physical examination. He is alert, oriented, and in no apparent distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently being closely monitored and maintained between 90-120 mmHg. If it falls below 90 mmHg, dopamine will be started, and if it exceeds 120 mmHg, nitro will be initiated.
2. Stroke: Given the patient's history of carotid artery disease and recent carotid stenting, there is a risk of stroke. Neurological exams are being performed regularly to assess any changes.
3. Bleeding:"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of CABG, CVA, and bilateral carotid artery disease presenting for right carotid stenting. The patient underwent the procedure without complications, but experienced a vagal reaction requiring atropine and had a transient increase in blood pressure that was managed with a nitroglycerin drip.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate in the 30s-50s bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/46 mmHg to 90/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress, with alert and oriented mental status. No pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa is noted, and the conjunctivae are pink. The patient has crackles at the bases of the lungs but no wheezes or rhonchi. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal bruits. The extremities show 1+ left and trace right lower leg edema. The patient has a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1, S2, no murmurs, lifts, or thrills. There are no femoral bruits, and the right upper extremity has a bandage that is coded elsewhere. The pulses are present and intact in all extremities.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 8.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, platelet count of 220 K/uL, creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 58 mg/dL. The PT/PTT/INR is elevated at 14.0/29.1/1.2, calcium level is 8.8 mg/dL, magnesium level is 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate level is 3.8 mg/dL. Other electrolytes and renal function tests are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of vasculopathy, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with no residual effect, and bilateral carotid artery disease status post left carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The patient is enrolled in a multicenter study for surveillance registry for patients undergoing carotid stenting.

The patient's plan includes maintaining blood pressure below 120 and above 90, monitoring neurologic examination every six hours, continuing aspirin, Plavix, and resuming Coumadin at a dose of 5 mg tonight. The patient will also continue with Lovenox bridge to Coumadin until the INR is therapeutic and start home dose Coumadin prior to discharge. The patient will be monitored for potential complications related to the recent procedure, including bleeding due to the elevated INR and potential arrhythmias.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and anemia of unclear etiology. The patient's diabetes will be managed with home dose glipizide and coverage with Humalog SS while in the hospital. The patient's anemia will be monitored, and efforts will be made to maintain hemoglobin concentration above 30 given the patient's CAD history.

Overall, the patient's current condition appears stable with no immediate life-threatening complications. However, close monitoring is required to manage the potential medical complications associated with the patient's medical history and recent procedure."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with no residual effect, and bilateral carotid artery disease who presented for right carotid stenting. The patient underwent the procedure without complications but experienced a vagal reaction during the procedure, which required administration of atropine. His blood pressure then increased to the 200s, necessitating the initiation of a nitro drip. 

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 44 bpm, blood pressure of 103/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in a bradycardic sinus rhythm and has a junctional rhythm on the electrocardiogram (ECG). 

The patient's laboratory values show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, his glucose level is low at 58 mg/dL, and his creatinine level is elevated at 2.0 mg/dL. 

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and previous femoral endarterectomy. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, beta-blocker, and metoprolol for rate control. He will also restart Coumadin as an outpatient.
