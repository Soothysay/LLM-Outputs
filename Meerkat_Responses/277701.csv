   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
   indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
   normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The aortic
   arch is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
   present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
   leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric jet
   of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic
   tricuspid valve is present. The leaflets are not well seen, but the
   gradient is increased (mean 6mmHg). Mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation
   is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-9-23**], the
   transtricuspid gradient is higher and the severity of tricuspid
   regurgitation and mitral regurgitation are reduced.
   If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define the
   tricuspid valve prosthesis and severity of mitral regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
 ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 60 yo female with h/o
   endocarditis, AVR, TVR, CHB s/p PPM placement, DVT/PE on
   anticoagulation, mental retardation, hypertension, DM2, who presented
   with chest pain, tachycardia, and hypotension and was found to have
   fasicular ventricular tachycardia.
   .
   # Fasicular VTach:  The patient presented with persistent tachycardia
   despite fluid resuscitation, which was found to be fasicular VTach.
   After programmed electical stimulation, the patient had a VPC and
   returned to A-V paced rhythm.  Her tachycardia has since resolved,.
    -- Continue to monitor on telemetry
    -  If patient gets tachy, give beta blocker.
    - f/u on tte final report
   .
   # Chest pain:  The patient presented with chest pain in the setting of
   Ventricular Tachycardia.  She states that the pain has somewhat
   resolved.  She has a history of CAD, though cardiac catheterization
   from [**2104**] showed clean coronary arteries.  DDx includes CAD v. GERD v.
   MSK complaints.
    - Continue nitro/morphine PRN pain
    - Continue PPI per home dose
   .
   # Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive in the ED.  Her Lisinopril
   and Furosemide were held, and the patient's BP has increased. Overnight
   BP is stable.
    - Continue home dose of Lasix
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril and consider restarting in the am.
    - F/U blood cultures to r/o infection. Still pending
   .
   # DM2: The patient has a history of Dm2, for which she takes insulin at
   home.
    - Continue home lantus, NPH [**Hospital1 **], and sliding scale

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of endocarditis, aortic valve replacement (AVR), tricuspid valve replacement (T VR), chronic heart block, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) on anticoagulation, mental retardation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with chest pain, tachycardia, and hypotension and was found to have fascicular ventricular tachycardia (VTach).

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate ranging from 60-119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/52-137/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being monitored on telemetry.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant S1 and S2 heart sounds, a systolic murmur, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, distended abdomen, and peripheral edema. The echocardiogram shows a mildly dilated left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size with low normal systolic function (LVEF 50-55%), mildly dilated aortic arch, well-se"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of endocarditis, aortic valve replacement (AVR), tricuspid valve replacement (TVC), congestive heart failure (CHB), placement of permanent pacemaker (PPM), deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), mental retardation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), who presented with chest pain, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient has undergone several interventions including programmed electrical stimulation (PES) and administration of medications such as nitro/morphine, lantus, NPH, sliding scale insulin, spiriva, atrovent/albuterol nebs, long-acting oxycontin/oxycodone, and therapeutic INR on coumadin.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's conditions and interventions include:

1. Cardiac complications:
- Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of endocarditis, AVR, TVR, CHB, and placement of PPM, there is a risk of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or bradycardia.
- Heart failure: The patient's history of CHB and previous episodes of hypotension may indicate a predisposition to heart failure exacerbation.

   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
   indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
   normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The aortic
   arch is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
   present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
   leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric jet
   of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic
   tricuspid valve is present. The leaflets are not well seen, but the
   gradient is increased (mean 6mmHg). Mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation
   is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-9-23**], the
   transtricuspid gradient is higher and the severity of tricuspid

- The patient experienced two episodes of triggered VT/junctional rhythm, one in the afternoon and another in the evening. The first episode was terminated with EP and 5mg IV verapamil, while the second episode converted on its own before a magnet was placed.
- The patient restarted their home medications, including Lisinopril and Oxycodone.
- Vancomycin was discontinued as the patient's leukocytosis resolved and they became afebrile.
- Verapamil SR 120 mg daily was started.
- The patient's negative I/O last night resulted in stopping the evening dose of Lasix.
- Allergies include penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracycline, erythromycin (oral), and sulfur.
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent episodes of rhythm disturbances.
- Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), current temperature of 37 C (98.6 F), heart rate between 61-115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/69 to 166/120 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%.

   TTE final read:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial
   pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
   size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
   The aortic arch is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
   prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated,
   with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   An eccentric jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present. The leaflets are not well
   seen, but the gradient is increased (mean 6mmHg). Mild [1+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.   Compared with the prior
   study (images reviewed) of [**2106-9-23**], the transtricuspid gradient is
   higher and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and mitral
   regurgitation are reduced.  If clinically indicated, a TEE would be
   better able to define the tricuspid valve prosthesis and severity of
   mitral regurgitation.

   # Hypotension: The patient without hypotension overnight, and some
   hypertension (166/120).  She was restarted on her lisinopril and
   morning Lasix dose, but due to fluid balance we are holding her evening
   Lasix dose.
    - Continue Lisinopril 2.5 mg Daily
    - F/U blood cultures to r/o infection.
   - DC antibiotics

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of endocarditis, atrioventricular valve replacement, chronic heart failure, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism on anticoagulation, mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with chest pain, tachycardia, and hypotension and was found to have triggered VT/junctional tachycardia yesterday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Triggered junctional tachycardia: The patient had two episodes of triggered VT/junctional tachycardia yesterday, which can potentially recur. The first episode was terminated with IV verapamil, and the second episode ended spontaneously. Continuous monitoring on telemetry and continuing verapamil SR 120 PO daily are recommended.

2. Chest pain: The patient presented with chest pain in the setting of ventricular tachycardia. She has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), although cardiac catheterization from 04/20 showed clean coronary arteries. It is important to continue oxycodone/ocycotin as per the home regimen and continue PPI per home dose.

3. Hypotension: The patient was without hypotension overnight, but some hypertension (166/120) was observed. She was restarted on her lisinopril and morning Lasix dose, but due to fluid balance, the evening Lasix dose is being"

   TTE final read:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial

   size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
   The aortic arch is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
   prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated,
   with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   An eccentric jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present. The leaflets are not well
   seen, but the gradient is increased (mean 6mmHg). Mild [1+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.   Compared with the prior
   study (images reviewed) of [**2106-9-23**], the transtricuspid gradient is
   higher and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and mitral
   regurgitation are reduced.  If clinically indicated, a TEE would be
   better able to define the tricuspid valve prosthesis and severity of
   mitral regurgitation.

   24 Hour Events:
   - In afternoon, 1pm, had episode of triggered VT / Junctional rhythm;
   terminated by EP and 5mg IV verapamil.  If recurs should place magnet
   briefly over pacemaker (resets) or give Verapamil 5mg IV (does decrease
   SBP [**9-20**] points).  She endorses some SOB and chest pain with these
   episodes.
   - Around 7pm, had another episode of triggered VT/Junctional rhythm,
   rhythm converted on own before magnet was placed.
   - Restarted home Lisinopril and Oxycodone
   - Discontinued Vancomycin ->leukocytosis resolving and afebrile
   - Started Verapamil SR 120 mg daily
   - Called patient
