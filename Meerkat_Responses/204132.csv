   though

   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Patient
s mental status changes severe
   enough to warrant intubation for airway protection. Initial concern for
   intracerebral hemorrhage given Head CT report from [**Hospital3 1573**], aniscoria, systemic anticoagulation with enoxaparin, and
   report of acute mental status changes. Possible etiologies of ICH would
   be an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, spontaneous bleed in
   setting of systemic anticoagulation, or unrealized trauma.   STAT head
   CT here (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage
   causing herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.
   Additionally, this presentation could represent a recurrence of his
   lymphoma, which was formerly thought to be in remission. Must consider
   that observed behavior and resulting mental status changes at [**Hospital 9798**] were consistent with a seizure. Is possible that
   patient's serotonergic medications of citalopram, nortriptyline, and
   dilaudid acted to create a serotonin syndrome that presented with
   patient turning head to right due to increased tone. On physical exam
   at this time, muscle tone is essentially normal and patient has no
   history of fevers or clonus at OSH. Must also consider that his
   presentation is related to meningitis or encephalitis, though no
   prodrome of illness aside from nausea and vomiting and no reported
   fevers. As for other infections, should screen with blood culture, UA
   (was seen to have [**6-24**] RBCs and WBCs at OSH), and CXR. No elevation in
   livier enzymes and ammonia of 27 at [**Hospital3 **], both of which are
   inconsistent with a hepatic encephalopathy.
   MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the settind of
   elevated LDH, this could be an indication of recurrent disease. Phos
   decreased dramatically which could have caused a metabolic
   encephaolpathy or precipitated a seizure.
   - Will keep patient intubated for now pending LP.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - am labs after phos repletion
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to aboid withdrawal from SSRI
   - hodl LP for now
   - blood cultures Uctx to screen for additional sources of infection
   that can cause acute mental status changes
   # Respiratory failure: sputum and consolidation on CXR suggest possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia
   - sent sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime pending ctx data
   #  hypophosphatemia: unclear etiology.  Unknown why it would be due to
   decreased absorption.  Also could be from increased losses.  Unlikely
hungry bone
 given normal calcium.   Could contribute to MS changes at
   this low of a level.
   -check PTH
   -urine lyes
   -repeat levels later this am
   #. Nausea and vomiting:
   Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital6 797**] was
   nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI series have yet been
   unrevealing. Some concern that this may be attributed to increased ICH
   in setting of known pituitary macroadenoma or new recurrence of NCS
   lymphoma.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron
   #. Report of abnormal EKG:
   Copy of EKG was not sent with patient; however, reportedly had diffuse
   ST and T changes that were attributed to nausea and vomiting and
   resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two sets of cardiac enzymes were
   reportedly negative at [**Hospital6 797**]. ECHO was performed and
   showed anteroseptal akinesis of left ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TEE to fully assess
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
   Patient is reportedly in remission after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD
   methotrexate, and intrathecal methotrexate. Possible his AMS is related
   to recurrence of his lymphoma.
   - Appreciate consultation from BMT service- consult heme/onc this am
   - Consider LP to rule out recurrent CNS lymphoma however unclear if can
   do this in the setting of MRI changes
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma:
   Recent labs to check HPA showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and
   cortisol with slightly high FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26
   (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   and will need to be rescheduled
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection. Appears
   to be without obvious infection at this time as drainage is
   serosanguinous.
   - Wound care consult
   - Potential surgery consult for further debridement pending full
   evaluation from wound care team

   - Standing polyethylene glycol and senna
   - PRN bisacodyl and lactulose

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 41-year-old gentleman with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, who presented with altered mental status, nausea, vomiting, and respiratory failure. He was intubated for airway protection and subsequently diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia, which is being treated with Vancomycin/Cefepime. The patient also has hypophosphatemia, a pituitary macroadenoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in remission, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. 

The patient's medical history includes acromegaly, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, pituitary macroadenoma, and previous hospitalization for nausea, vomiting, and respiratory failure. He has had multiple imaging studies, including a head CT, which showed mild increased density diffusely, interdigitating with sulci, especially near the skull base. An MRI confirmed the presence of abnormal hyperintensity on T2/FLAIR in the right temporal lobe and anterior left temporal lobe. 

The patient's current medications include midazolam, lansoprazole, metoprolol, acetaminophen, artificial tears, multivitamins, bisacodyl, neutraphos, potassium phos, citalopram, polyethylene glycol, senna, lactulose, fentanyl, propofol, and ondansetron.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient"

   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Patient
s mental status changes severe
   enough to warrant intubation for airway protection. Initial concern for
   intracerebral hemorrhage given Head CT report from [**Hospital3 1573**], aniscoria, systemic anticoagulation with enoxaparin, and
   report of acute mental status changes. Possible etiologies of ICH would
   be an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, spontaneous bleed in
   setting of systemic anticoagulation, or unrealized trauma.   STAT head
   CT here (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage
   causing herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.
   Additionally, this presentation could represent a recurrence of his
   lymphoma, which was formerly thought to be in remission. Must consider
   that observed behavior and resulting mental status changes at [**Hospital 9798**] were consistent with a seizure. Is possible that
   patient's serotonergic medications of citalopram, nortriptyline, and
   dilaudid acted to create a serotonin syndrome that presented with
   patient turning head to right due to increased tone. On physical exam
   at this time, muscle tone is essentially normal and patient has no
   history of fevers or clonus at OSH. Must also consider that his
   presentation is related to meningitis or encephalitis, though no
   prodrome of illness aside from nausea and vomiting and no reported
   fevers. As for other infections, should screen with blood culture, UA
   (was seen to have [**6-24**] RBCs and WBCs at OSH), and CXR. No elevation in
   livier enzymes and ammonia of 27 at [**Hospital3 **], both of which are
   inconsistent with a hepatic encephalopathy.
   MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the settind of
   elevated LDH, this could be an indication of recurrent disease. Phos
   decreased dramatically which could have caused a metabolic
   encephaolpathy or precipitated a seizure.
   - Attempt to liberate from sedation overnight to assess patient's
   underlying mental status, then consider extubation if no neurosurg
   involvement
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - am labs after phos repletion
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to aboid withdrawal from SSRI
   - hodl LP for now
   - CXR, blood cultures, and UA to screen for additional sources of
   infection that can cause acute mental status changes
   #  hypophosphatemia: unclear etiology.  Unknown why it would be due to
   decreased absorption.  Also could be from increased losses.  Unlikely
hungry bone
 given normal calcium.   Could contribute to MS changes at
   this low of a level.
   -check PTH
   -urine lyes
   -repeat levels later this am
   #. Nausea and vomiting:
   Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital6 797**] was
   nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI series have yet been
   unrevealing. Some concern that this may be attributed to increased ICH
   in setting of known pituitary macroadenoma or new recurrence of NCS
   lymphoma.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron
   #. Report of abnormal EKG:
   Copy of EKG was not sent with patient; however, reportedly had diffuse
   ST and T changes that were attributed to nausea and vomiting and
   resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two sets of cardiac enzymes were
   reportedly negative at [**Hospital6 797**]. ECHO was performed and
   showed anteroseptal akinesis of left ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - Consider TEE to fully assess
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
   Patient is reportedly in remission after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD
   methotrexate, and intrathecal methotrexate. Possible his AMS is related
   to recurrence of his lymphoma.
   - Appreciate consultation from BMT service- consult heme/onc this am
   - Consider LP to rule out recurrent CNS lymphoma however unclear if can
   do this in the setting of MRI changes
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma:
   Recent labs to check HPA showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and
   cortisol with slightly high FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26
   (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   and will need to be rescheduled
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection. Appears
   to be without obvious infection at this time as drainage is
   serosanguinous.
   - Wound care consult
   - Potential surgery consult for further debridement pending full
   evaluation from wound care team

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He presented with altered mental status, which led to intubation for airway protection. Initial concerns included intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, spontaneous bleed in systemic anticoagulation, or unrealized trauma. A subsequent head CT ruled out massive hemorrhage causing herniation but still showed a possibility of small hemorrhage. The patient's symptoms could also be related to a seizure, serotonin syndrome, meningitis, or encephalitis. An MRI revealed new abnormal hyperintensity in the right temporal lobe and anterior left temporal lobe, with a possible diagnosis of lymphoma recurrence or hemorrhage. Other findings included hypophosphatemia, nausea and vomiting, abnormal EKG changes, and a history of pituitary macroadenoma and acromegaly. The patient has a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in remission after chemotherapy and is currently in the ICU for further evaluation and treatment."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma.
- He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, which led to intubation for airway protection.
- The initial concern was intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but subsequent head CT ruled out massive hemorrhage causing herniation.
- Other possible etiologies of ICH include ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, spontaneous bleed in the setting of systemic anticoagulation, or unrealized trauma.
- The patient's presentation could also represent a recurrence of his lymphoma, which was formerly thought to be in remission.
- The patient's behavior at another hospital was consistent with a seizure, and there is a possibility that his current mental status changes are related to a seizure.
- Other potential causes of acute mental status changes include meningitis, encephalitis, hepatic encephalopathy, or metabolic encephalopathy.
- An MRI showed new abnormal hyperintensity on T2/FLAIR in the right temporal lobe and anterior left temporal lobe, which could indicate neoplasm such as lymphoma or acute hemorrhage.
- The patient has a known pituitary macroadenoma and has been experiencing nausea and vomiting.
- An EKG showed diffuse ST and T changes attributed to nausea and vomiting, but cardiac enzymes were negative.

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by

   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is probably mild global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2144-8-13**], the LVEF is less vigorous. The pericardial effusion is
   slightly larger but still with no evidence for overt tamponade.
   CXR in OMR today
   MRI/MRA final read:
   1. Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity
   involving the
   right greater than left temporal and parietal lobes, with more focal
   areas of
   parenchymal abnormality in the temporal lobe, also right greater than
   left.
   Differential diagnostic considerations primarily include recurrent
   lymphoma
   (especially given the patient's history of Burkitt's lymphoma) as well
   as a
   meningoencephalitis such as herpes encephalitis, although other viral
   or
   bacterial meningoencephalitides could also result in a similar
   appearance.
   2. Areas of decreased diffusion corresponding to the leptomeningeal
   disease
   with additional foci involving the right thalamus and right
   hippocampus, which
   may represent acute infarcts, although they may be related to
   lymphomatous
   involvement versus infectious process given the findings above. Hypoxic
   injury would be a less likely differential consideration.
   3. Suboptimal MRA and MRV given patient motion. There is no definite
   evidence of venous thrombosis, although the sigmoid sinuses and the
   visualized
   internal jugular veins are suboptimally evaluated.
   4. No evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis on the MRA of
   the
   head, although irregularity at the anterior communicating artery raises
   the
   possibility of a small aneurysm. This was suboptimally evaluated given
   the
   degree of patient motion. At the time of followup imaging, the MRA
   sequence
   could be repeated.
   5. Pituitary adenoma, not significantly changed since the prior
   examination
   when accounting for differences in technique, although dedicated
   imaging of
   the sella was not obtained today.
    Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.

   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, currently admitted to the ICU for altered mental status. He has been intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia and is also being treated with IV dexamethasone for possible recurrent lymphoma. Other concerns include nausea and vomiting, a history of deep vein thrombosis, an abnormal EKG, acromegaly with pituitary macroadenoma, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent lymphoma: The patient's preliminary lumbar puncture results suggest a recurrence of lymphoma in the central nervous system. This condition can lead to neurological deterioration and require further treatment such as radiation therapy or high-dose methotrexate.

2. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, which could indicate a healthcare-associated pneumonia. If not appropriately treated, this infection can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.

3. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient has a high opening pressure during lumbar puncture, indicating increased ICP. This condition can worsen if not managed properly and can lead to brain herniation or other neurological complications.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT,"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is probably mild global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2144-8-13**], the LVEF is less vigorous. The pericardial effusion is
   slightly larger but still with no evidence for overt tamponade.
   CXR in OMR today
   MRI/MRA final read:
   1. Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity
   involving the
   right greater than left temporal and parietal lobes, with more focal
   areas of
   parenchymal abnormality in the temporal lobe, also right greater than
   left.
   Differential diagnostic considerations primarily include recurrent
   lymphoma
   (especially given the patient's history of Burkitt's lymphoma) as well
   as a
   meningoencephalitis such as herpes encephalitis, although other viral
   or
   bacterial meningoencephalitides could also result in a similar
   appearance.
   2. Areas of decreased diffusion corresponding to the leptomeningeal
   disease
   with additional foci involving the right thalamus and right
   hippocampus, which
   may represent acute infarcts, although they may be related to
   lymphomatous
   involvement versus infectious process given the findings above. Hypoxic
   injury would be a less likely differential consideration.
   3. Suboptimal MRA and MRV given patient motion. There is no definite
   evidence of venous thrombosis, although the sigmoid sinuses and the
   visualized
   internal jugular veins are suboptimally evaluated.
   4. No evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis on the MRA of
   the
   head, although irregularity at the anterior communicating artery raises
   the
   possibility of a small aneurysm. This was suboptimally evaluated given
   the
   degree of patient motion. At the time of followup imaging, the MRA
   sequence
   could be repeated.
   5. Pituitary adenoma, not significantly changed since the prior
   examination
   when accounting for differences in technique, although dedicated
   imaging of
   the sella was not obtained today.
    Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH, most likely recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate heme/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   # Respiratory failure: Sputum and consolidation on CXR suggest possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was intubated for airway
   protection at OSH
   - sent sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 2 of 10
   - plan for extubation today, if possible
   #  Hypophosphatemia: Unclear etiology.  Unknown why it would be due to
   decreased absorption.  Also could be from increased losses.  Unlikely
hungry bone
 given normal calcium.   Could contribute to MS changes at
   this low of a level.
   -check PTH
   -urine lytes
   -repeat levels later this am
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing. Some concern that this may be
   attributed to increased ICH in setting of known pituitary macroadenoma
   or new recurrence of NCS lymphoma.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TEE to fully assess
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate. Possible his AMS is related to recurrence of his
   lymphoma.
   - Appreciate consultation from BMT service
   - FU LP results
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   and will need to be rescheduled
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care consult
   - Potential surgery consult for further debridement pending full
   evaluation from wound care team

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU care for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and subsequent airway protection intubation. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a recurrence of lymphoma in the CNS. There is also concern for infection or hemorrhage. A head CT ruled out massive hemorrhage causing herniation, but there is still a possibility of small hemorrhage. An MRI will be performed to differentiate between hemorrhage and malignancy. Given the elevated LDH levels, recurrent lymphoma is the most likely cause.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has sputum and consolidation on CXR, suggesting possible healthcare-associated pneumonia. He was intubated for airway protection at OSH. The plan is to continue with a 10-day course of Vancomycin/Cefepime, and if possible, extubation will be attempted today.

3. Hypophosphatemia: The cause of hypophosphatemia is unclear, with unknown reasons for decreased absorption or increased losses. It is unlikely to be due to hungry bone syndrome given normal calcium levels. The low level of phosphorus could contribute to MS changes. Further investigation is needed, including checking PTH, urine lytes, and repeating levels later this morning.

4. Nausea and"

   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the

   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, who presented with altered mental status leading to intubation for airway protection. He self-extubated and is now on invasive ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, pituitary macroadenoma, lymphoma, a rash, nausea and vomiting, a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), an abnormal EKG with dynamic left ventricular akinesis, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to recurrent lymphoma in the CNS, infection, or hemorrhage. A stat head CT ruled out massive hemorrhage causing herniation, but there is still a possibility of small hemorrhage. An MRI is needed to differentiate between hemorrhage and malignancy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, possibly healthcare-associated pneumonia. He is on a 10-day course of Vancomycin/Cefepime.
3. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: The patient is reportedly in remission after chemotherapy but LP suggests recurrence. Further evaluation is required.
4. Rash: The rash is likely drug-related, possibly due to Vancomycin.
5. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to increased intracranial pressure.

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate BMT input
   - Appreciate neuro/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   - Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**]
   - d/c Acyclovir as per neuro did not suggest it and it seems this is
   lymphoma according to LP
   - send VBG
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH
   - f/u sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 3 of 10
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone
   - bolus 1L now then start maintenance fluids as not taking good PO
   - IV phos
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TTE here without change from previous except dynamic LV
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status leading to intubation. He recently self-extubated and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, electrolyte imbalances, and an elevated LDH level. He also has a decubitus ulcer, acute mental status change, pituitary macroadenoma, acromegaly, lymphoma, rash, nausea and vomiting, history of DVT, abnormal EKG, and sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to recurrent lymphoma in the CNS, infection, or hemorrhage. A head CT ruled out massive hemorrhage causing herniation, but there is still a possibility of small hemorrhage. An MRI is needed to differentiate between hemorrhage and malignancy.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, possibly healthcare-associated pneumonia, as suggested by sputum and consolidation on the chest X-ray. He was intubated for airway protection at another hospital.

3. Coag + Staph Sputum: The patient's sputum culture is positive for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Neuro-oncology feels that full brain XRT would be the next step, but
   primary team feels that he would not be able to tolerate this treatment
   without intubation and unclear the benefit of intubation at this point
   - Will hold off on XRT pending discussions with radiation oncology,
   BMt, and neuro-oncology teams
   - Continue high-dose Decadron
   - Will involve social worker [**Name (NI) 1072**] regarding goals of care, family
   situation, etc
   - FU final LP results
   - Check tumor lysis labs
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.
   - Stat CT head now to assess for herniation vs increased ICP.  Nausea
   and vomiting also likely due to increased ICP.
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Continue Decadron as above
   - Have stopped acyclovir
   - Check EEG to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine output.
   - Stop D51/2NS at this time to minimize worsening cerebral edema
   - Check CT head as above
   - Check urine lytes, recheck serum lytes, osmolarity
   - Replete lytes as needed
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH, now exubated and doing well.
   - F/u sputum ctx
   - Plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 4 of 10
   #. Hiccups: Will try thorazine for hiccup prevention.
   #. Rash: Likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   - Will monitor
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Will try to put in NG tube again, may need PEG later

   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, currently admitted to the ICU for altered mental status. The patient underwent intubation for airway protection but self-extubated on 12/26. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening altered mental status, fever, and respiratory distress.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 145/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is unresponsive to verbal or tactile stimuli and does not follow commands.

Physical examination reveals mildly dilated pupils that are mildly reactive bilaterally, faint rhonchi bilaterally, and 2+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, leukocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. The patient has an increased urine output, and the respiratory culture shows moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient's medical history includes a previous admission for lymphoma treatment, a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma. The patient also has a sacral decubitus ulcer and is at risk for healthcare-associated pneumonia.

   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate BMT input
   - Appreciate neuro/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   - Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**]
   - d/c Acyclovir as per neuro did not suggest it and it seems this is
   lymphoma according to LP
   - send VBG
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH
   - f/u sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 3 of 10
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone
   - bolus 1L now then start maintenance fluids as not taking good PO
   (D51/2NS @125)
   - IV phos
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TTE here without change from previous except dynamic LV
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on

   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate BMT input
   - Appreciate neuro/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   - Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**]
   - d/c Acyclovir as per neuro did not suggest it and it seems this is
   lymphoma according to LP
   - send VBG
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH
   - f/u sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 3 of 10
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone
   - bolus 1L now then start maintenance fluids as not taking good PO
   (D51/2NS @125)
   - IV phos
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TTE here without change from previous except dynamic LV
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, who presented with altered mental status leading to intubation for airway protection. He was transferred from another hospital and self-extubated on 12/26. The patient has multiple medical problems including respiratory failure, acute mental status change, pituitary macroadenoma, acromegaly, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, rash, nausea and vomiting, history of DVT, and an abnormal EKG.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 145/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently on several medications including metoprolol, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and various antibiotics.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, but decreased lymphocyte count. His electrolytes are within normal range except for a slightly low magnesium level. The patient's creatinine level is normal, but his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is elevated. Other lab results including liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and albumin are within normal limits. The patient's urine culture is negative, and his sputum gram stain shows"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Tachypnea and Hypoxia: Overnight has had persistent tachypnea and
   hypoxia, requiring face mask for oxygen delivery.  Possibly related to
   aspiration event overnight, but unfortunately more likely related to
   systemic lymphoma as LDH increasing.  Feel that this represents a
   significant downtown in his clinical course and XRT very unlikely to
   benefit him at this time.  Feel that he was uncomfortable overnight and
   responded to morphine.  Best course for the patient at this point is to
   become [**Month/Year (2) **] measures only.
   - Have discussed CMO with health care proxy, will be by this afternoon
   - Continue high-flow oxygen delivery in face tent form to make patient
   comfortable
   - Morphine prn for patient [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to transition to drip at
   some point today
   - Will stop antibiotics at this time, as not [**First Name3 (LF) **] measures
   - Will give 1L NS now to prevent tachycardia and perhaps help patient
   feel better on some level
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Scheduled for course of XRT today but given clinical deterioration,
   unlikely to benefit him and would cause more distress than benefit.
   Will stop treatments
   - Continue high-dose Decadron for palliation
   - Health care proxy updated on poor prognosis and plan
   - FU final LP results
   - Tumor lysis labs negative at this time
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.  Still not
   responsive except to noxious stimuli.
   - CT head yesterday not significantly changed from previous but need
   MRI to fully assess
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Continue Decadron as above
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine
   output.  Now urine output has tapered off and urine appears
   concentrated based on urine lytes.
   #. Hiccups: Unclear if thorazine had benefit yesterday but can continue
   for [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Will stop Lovenox given CMO status
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He was admitted to the ICU due to an episode of altered mental status and required intubation for airway protection. The patient's clinical course has been complicated by several medical complications.

1. Tachypnea and hypoxia: The patient has persistent tachypnea and hypoxia, which may be related to aspiration or systemic lymphoma. This represents a significant downturn in his clinical course, and radiation therapy (XRT) is unlikely to benefit him at this time.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in the CNS, especially given the LP results and increasing LDH levels. He remains unresponsive except to noxious stimuli.

3. Increased urine output: There is concern for central diabetes insipidus given increased intracranial pressure and increased urine output. However, the urine output has tapered off, and the urine appears concentrated based on urine lytes.

4. Hiccups: The cause of the patient's hiccups is unclear, but thorazine may have had some benefit. Continuing thorazine for further management is recommended.

5. History of DVT: The patient had a previous episode of DVT and was supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months after the event. However, given the CMO"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He was admitted to the hospital due to altered mental status and later transferred to the ICU for airway protection. The patient underwent intubation but self-extubated on December 26th. Since then, he has been experiencing persistent tachypnea and hypoxia, requiring oxygen delivery through a face mask. He is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in his sputum. The patient's condition is consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma, as indicated by CSF results and clinical picture. He has been scheduled for a course of radiation therapy (XRT) for two weeks, starting yesterday. He is also on high-dose Decadron and his healthcare proxy has been updated on his poor prognosis. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to the recurrence of lymphoma in the CNS. A CT head was done yesterday, but an MRI is needed to fully assess the situation. The patient's urine output has tapered off, and his urine appears concentrated, raising concerns for central diabetes insipidus. He is being monitored closely, and his lytes will be repleted as needed. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is restarting Lovenox for anticoagulation. He also has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and subsequent intubation for airway protection. The patient self-extubated on [**Month/Year (2) 303**]. He is now on comfort measures only, with all non-comfort medications stopped. The patient has metastatic disease to the brain and clinical findings consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma. His current condition includes worsening altered mental status, hiccups, a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a sacral decubitus ulcer, and indwelling lines. The patient's code status is comfort measures only, DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: Due to the patient's altered mental status and self-extubation, there is a risk of respiratory distress or failure.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of sacral decubitus ulcer with a recent pseudomonal infection. There is a potential for developing further infections, especially given his compromised immune system due to lymphoma and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on Lovenox, which may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
4. Neurological complications: With metastatic disease to the brain, the patient is at risk of neurological deterioration and further CNS lymph"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has a history of lymphoma (cancer) and is currently experiencing altered mental status, respiratory failure, and a decubitus ulcer. The patient has been diagnosed with a pituitary macroadenoma and acromegaly. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 119/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on face tent with 100% FiO2. The patient is on morphine sulfate infusion for pain management. 

The patient has received various medications, including cefepime, vancomycin, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and metoprolol. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated uric acid levels, slightly increased lactate levels, and normal potassium levels. The white blood cell count is within normal range, with a slightly elevated platelet count. Other lab values, such as hemoglobin, creatinine, and electrolytes, are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient has been receiving fluids and has had a total fluid input of 3,274 mL and output of 3,840 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 566 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on 100% FiO2 via a face tent. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted respiratory issues. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include respiratory distress, infections (due to immunosuppression from cancer or medications), pressure ulcers, and thromboembolic events."

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He was admitted to the ICU following an episode of altered mental status, which led to intubation for airway protection. The patient subsequently self-extubated. He is currently experiencing persistent tachypnea and hypoxia, requiring face mask oxygen delivery. His condition has deteriorated, and comfort measures only have been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea and Hypoxia: The patient's persistent tachypnea and hypoxia indicate respiratory distress. This may be due to aspiration or systemic lymphoma, as evidenced by the increasing LDH levels.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's worsening altered mental status is likely due to recurrent CNS lymphoma, supported by CSF results and increasing LDH levels.
3. Increased Urine Output: The patient's increased urine output may be a concern for central diabetes insipidus, given the known increased intracranial pressure.
4. Hiccups: The patient's hiccups may be treated with thorazine for comfort.
5. History of DVT: The patient had a previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months. However, Lovenox will be stopped due to the patient's current status.
6. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has"

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU. He was transferred from another hospital due to altered mental status and subsequent intubation for airway protection. The patient self-extubated on [**Month/Year (2) 303**] and is now on comfort measures only, DNR/DNI status. The patient's condition has worsened, with persistent tachypnea and hypoxia requiring face mask oxygen delivery. There is evidence of recurrent CNS lymphoma, and the patient is not responsive except to noxious stimuli. Other issues include increased urine output, hiccups, a history of DVT, and a sacral decubitus ulcer."

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**] and CMO secondary to metastatic disease to the brain.
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Now comfort measures only
   - All non-comfort medications stopped, no blood draws or imaging.
   - Health care proxy being updated regularly, will get waist measurement
   today per his request
   - FU final LP results
   #. Hiccups: Unclear if thorazine is having benefit but can continue for
   comfort.
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Will stop Lovenox given CMO status
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and subsequent intubation for airway protection. The patient recently self-extubated and is now in comfort measures only (CMO) status, with all non-comfort medications stopped.

The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months after the event. However, given the patient's current comfort measures only status, it is mentioned that Lovenox will be stopped.

The patient also has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which is reported to be a stage IV ulcer with a recent pseudomonal infection. Currently, the drainage is serosanguinous, and wound care recommendations have been applied for comfort.

In terms of medical complications that can arise, based on the patient's history and current status, the following potential complications can be considered:

1. Infection: The patient has had a pseudomonal infection in the past, and there is a risk of developing further infections due to his weakened immune system from the high-grade B-cell lymphoma and the comfort measures only status.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is currently on comfort measures only and Lovenox has been stopped, there is still a risk of developing DVT due to imm"
