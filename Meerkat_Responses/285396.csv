","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and seizures, admitted to the ICU after experiencing a seizure. He was initially stabilized in the ICU but then called down to the floor where he became increasingly delirious. The patient has several medical issues, including delirium, ethanol abuse, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's increasing delirium may lead to further complications such as falls, worsening mental status, or difficulty in self-care.
2. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient's symptoms of tachycardia, diaphoresis, and delirium are consistent with ethanol withdrawal. If left untreated, this can progress to more severe symptoms like seizures or delirium tremens.
3. Leukopenia: The cause of leukopenia is unclear, and it should be monitored closely. If not properly managed, it can increase the risk of infections.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to chronic alcohol use and hepatic sinusoidal dilatation. It is important to monitor for signs of bleeding or bruising.
5. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate liver damage. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse and previous episodes of alcohol withdrawal seizures. He was admitted post-seizure and is now back in the MICU with acute agitation, delirium, tachycardia, and tremors. The patient is being treated for suspected alcohol withdrawal/DTs with Valium per CIWA scale every 1 hour as needed. He has also received a banana bag (thiamine, folate) and his blood pressure and heart rate are being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: Given the patient's history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, there is a risk of recurrent seizures during withdrawal.
2. Delirium tremens (DTs): The patient's symptoms of acute agitation, delirium, and tremors suggest the possibility of DTs, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal.
3. Wernicke's encephalopathy: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to thiamine deficiency, putting the patient at risk for Wernicke's encephalopathy, characterized by confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia.
4. Hepatitis: Alcohol abuse can cause liver inflammation and damage, leading to hepatitis.
5. Pancytopenia: Chronic alcohol abuse can result in bone marrow suppression, causing low blood cell counts (pancytopenia).
6. Infection: Prolonged ICU"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse and a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures. He was admitted post-seizure and is now in the ICU with acute agitation and delirium due to ethanol withdrawal/Delirium Tremens (DTs). The patient has been receiving 100 mg of valium over 24 hours as per the CIWA scale, and an EEG was completed but results are pending. The patient has a language barrier and cannot provide his own medical history. He has no known drug allergies. 

24-hour events include receiving diazepam (Valium) and famotidine (Pepcid). The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and fever, with blood pressure within normal range. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are being provided. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be thin and more cooperative, with pale conjunctiva, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and clear breath sounds. The patient has absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination except for confusion and disorientation.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and total white blood cell count. Liver function tests indicate elevated ALT and AST levels, while other lab values are within normal range.

Plan:
1. Continue administration of valium per CIWA scale every 1 hour prn, then change to standing 10 mg Q 4.
2. Continue banana bag (thiamine folate) daily until able to take POs.
3. Repeat head CT to reassess for chronic subdural hematoma concern due to thrombocytopenia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU for ETOH withdrawal. The patient has been agitated and hypertensive, requiring increased doses of diazepam for sedation and BP control. An MRI was initially planned due to concerns of PRES or sinus thrombosis, but it could not be obtained due to the patient's agitation and need for restraints. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and an increased respiratory rate. The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.6 g/dL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and an elevated LDH level. The patient's blood cultures are negative.

Potential Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient's history of alcohol withdrawal and increased serum liver enzymes may increase the risk of seizures.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated LDH level could indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be monitored and treated if necessary.
3. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PTT and INR suggest a coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Organ dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes and abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine) may indicate potential organ dysfunction.
5. Delirium: The patient's agitation and fluctuating mental status may suggest delirium, which requires close monitoring and management.

    # Etoh abuse - Had been stabilized earlier in hospital course,
   however, increasingly delirious, tachycardic, and diaphoretic, c/w
   withdrawal.

   # Delirium - given risk factors, ie, chronic appearing subdural
   hematomas on CT head.
   - repeat CT head shows ? PRES syndrome possibly related to changes in
   blood pressure
   - cx urine, blood, sputum if possible, CXR today
   - f/u neuro recs, order placed for MRI but patiently unlikely to

   hydralazine
   # Thrombocytopenia - [**Month (only) 51**] be from chronic alcohol use and HSM, although
   spleen difficult to palpate on my exam. Will check LFTs and if elevated
   would get abdominal imaging to evaluate further.
   - stable

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse and seizures. The patient was admitted after experiencing a seizure and was initially stabilized in the ICU. However, he became increasingly delirious, tachycardic, and diaphoretic, which is consistent with alcohol withdrawal symptoms. 

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient requires close monitoring for symptoms of withdrawal and may require benzodiazepines for treatment.
2. Delirium: The patient exhibits signs of delirium, which could be related to chronic alcohol use or other underlying conditions such as PRES syndrome.
3. Hypertension: The patient has persistently high blood pressure, which needs to be controlled to prevent further complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to chronic alcohol use or other causes. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has abnormal LFTs, which could be related to alcohol abuse or other underlying liver conditions. Monitoring and additional investigations are necessary.
6. Imaging findings: The CT scan shows patchy hypodensities in the occipital lobes, suggesting possible PRES syndrome or venous sinus thrombosis. An MRI would help confirm the diagnosis.
7. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance"

    # Etoh abuse - Had been stabilized earlier in hospital course,
   however, increasingly delirious, tachycardic, and diaphoretic, c/w
   withdrawal. Increased diazepam this AM with good response.
   - required 100mg IV diazepam overnight
   - continue with diazepam 15mg IV q2h standing, and 10mg IV q2h prn
   throughout the morning, if patient remains calm this afternoon, may
   switch to oral standing regimen, with IV diazepam for breakthrough
   - thiamine

   # Delirium - given risk factors, ie, chronic appearing subdural
   hematomas on CT head.
   - repeat CT head shows ? PRES syndrome possibly related to changes in
   blood pressure vs. thrombosis
   - cx urine, blood, sputum if possible, CXR today
   - f/u neuro recs, MRI today to evaluate for thrombosis
   - EEG result unremarkable

   # HTN
   - if concern for PRES would want to control BP, continue with
   hydralazine
   # Thrombocytopenia - [**Month (only) 51**] be from chronic alcohol use and HSM, although
   spleen difficult to palpate on my exam. Will check LFTs and if elevated
   would get abdominal imaging to evaluate further.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and seizures. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a seizure and initially stabilized. However, he became increasingly delirious, tachycardic, and diaphoretic, consistent with withdrawal symptoms. The patient has been treated with diazepam for withdrawal management. Other medical issues include delirium, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver function tests.

Potential medical complications:
1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient shows signs of withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, persistent hypertension, and increased diazepam requirements. Close monitoring and continued administration of diazepam are necessary to manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent complications like seizures.
2. PRES syndrome: The CT scan reveals patchy hypodensities in the subcortical white matter of the occipital lobes, which are concerning for PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). This condition can lead to seizures, altered mental status, and neurological deficits. Further evaluation with an MRI and management of blood pressure are recommended.
3. Venous sinus thrombosis: The CT scan also shows slightly more prominent extraaxial fluid collections, which may be related to altered CSF flow dynamics. Venous sinus thrombosis could be a possible cause for these findings. An MRV can help exclude this possibility.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse and previous episodes of ethanol withdrawal seizures. He was admitted after experiencing a seizure and is now being transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to ongoing ethanol withdrawal and delirium tremens (DTs). The patient's agitation has increased overnight, requiring higher doses of diazepam for sedation. There are concerns about possible intravenous (IV) leak. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and there are findings suggestive of possible sinus thrombosis on the head CT. An MRI brain is planned for further evaluation. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, and he is tachycardic with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute. His respiratory rate is within normal limits, and his oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, and his extremities are warm and well-perfused. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16,100 cells/mm3, elevated liver enzymes, and pancytopenia. The patient is not currently receiving enteral nutrition and will continue with maintenance intravenous fluids. He is at an increased risk for aspiration, so his head of bed will be elevated. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse and previous episodes of alcohol withdrawal seizures. He was admitted to the ICU for ethanol withdrawal/delirium tremens (DTs). The patient presented with agitation, persistent hypertension, and possible presinus thrombosis on head CT. He has been treated with diazepam for withdrawal and hydralazine for blood pressure control. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/60 mmHg to 130/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly decreased hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume. Liver function tests reveal elevated ALT and AST levels, while electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Imaging studies include a head CT without evidence of acute changes and an upcoming MRI brain for further evaluation of the possible sinus thrombosis. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of ethanol withdrawal, investigation of the cause of presinus thrombosis, and monitoring for complications such as hypertension, infection, and pancytopenia. The patient will continue to receive IV fluids, nutritional support, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and seizures. He was admitted after experiencing a seizure and initially stabilized in the ICU. The patient became increasingly delirious, tachycardic, and diaphoretic, indicating signs of alcohol withdrawal. He received intravenous diazepam for agitation and is now being switched to oral diazepam. Thiamine and folate supplementation have also been initiated.

Assessment and Plan:
1. ETOH withdrawal - The patient has shown improvement with diazepam treatment and is less agitated today.
2. Delirium - Likely related to ETOH withdrawal. Further evaluation is needed, including urine culture, chest X-ray, MRI (though limited by motion), and EEG results.
3. HTN - The patient has high blood pressure, which needs to be managed. Hydralazine has been prescribed.
4. Thrombocytopenia - The patient's platelet count is low. It could be due to chronic alcohol use and hypersplenism. Liver function tests (LFTs) will be checked, and if elevated, further abdominal imaging will be done.
5. Elevated LFTs - The patient has abnormal liver function tests. They are trending downwards, indicating improvement.
6. FEN - The patient's diet has been advanced to full liquids, and a request has been made to remove the PICC line if the patient continues to improve and can tolerate"

   - patient much less agitated today and oriented times 3
   - switch to oral diazepam 15mg IV q4h standing, and 10mg PO q2h
   - thiamine oral
   - folate oral
   .
   # Delirium - given risk factors, ie, chronic appearing subdural
   hematomas on CT head.
   - repeat CT head shows ? PRES syndrome possibly related to changes in
   blood pressure vs. thrombosis

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and seizures, admitted to the ICU after experiencing a seizure. The patient was initially stabilized in the ICU but was later called out to the floor due to delirium, tachycardia, and diaphoresis, consistent with alcohol withdrawal. The patient received IV diazepam for agitation and has shown improvement with orientation times three.

The patient is being treated for multiple conditions including:
1. ETOH withdrawal - the patient is receiving diazepam IV and PO to manage symptoms.
2. Delirium - the patient's risk factors include chronic appearing subdural hematomas on CT head. The repeat CT head shows possible PRES syndrome, possibly related to changes in blood pressure or thrombosis. The urine culture is pending, and an MRI was performed but not optimal.
3. Hypertension - the patient is being switched to hydralazine PO prn.
4. Thrombocytopenia - the patient's platelet count is 51, which could be due to chronic alcohol use and hypersplenism. Further evaluation is needed, including LFTs and abdominal imaging if elevated.
5. Elevated LFTs - the patient is immunized against Hepatitis B, and there is no evidence of active infection. The LFTs are trending downwards.
6. Feeding - the patient is advancing to full liquids and will discontinue the PICC line if improving.
7. Restraints - the patient will continue with two-point restraints until confirmed to be taking PO and the CIWA scale is low.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizures - the patient has a history of seizures and may be at risk for recurrent seizures due to ETOH withdrawal.
2. Infection - the patient is at risk for infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection due to immobility and indwelling lines.
3. Bleeding - the patient has thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Delirium - the patient is currently experiencing delirium, which can increase the risk of falls and other complications.
5. Hypotension - the patient's blood pressure needs to be monitored closely to prevent hypotension, especially during the transition from IV to PO medications.
6. Liver dysfunction - the patient has elevated liver enzymes, which need to be closely monitored for any signs of liver failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse and a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures. He is currently in the ICU due to alcohol withdrawal/delirium. The patient attempted to undergo an MRI but was unable to due to severe agitation and uncooperativeness. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia and hypertension. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,788 mL with a total output of 845 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,943 mL. The patient is on various medications including diazepam, famotidine, and heparin. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes. The assessment includes possible ethanol withdrawal, essential hypertension, and a potential sinus thrombosis that was not evident on the initial CT scan. Other assessments include low-grade fever, stable WBC count, unremarkable urine analysis, and pancytopenia likely related to chronic alcohol abuse. The plan includes transitioning to PO valium standing and as needed, administering PO thiamine and folate, and obtaining further neuro input.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures and is currently experiencing alcohol withdrawal/delirium. This condition can lead to complications such as seizures, hallucinations, autonomic instability, and potential progression to delirium tremens.
2. Essential hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse and a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures. He is currently in the ICU for ethanol withdrawal/delirium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/100 mmHg to 108/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no focal neurologic deficits. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin levels, and an elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued ethanol withdrawal symptoms: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures and is currently experiencing ethanol withdrawal/delirium. It is important to monitor for worsening symptoms and provide appropriate treatment with benzodiazepines as needed.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, ranging from 142/100 mmHg to 108/50 mmHg. This could be related to ethanol withdrawal or essential hypertension. Close monitoring and management with antihypertensive medication may be necessary.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to ethanol abuse. Monitoring liver function and addressing any underlying causes, such as ongoing alcohol use, is important.
4. Thiamine deficiency: Chronic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse and previous episodes of alcohol withdrawal seizures. He is currently in the ICU for ethanol withdrawal and delirium. He has been receiving standing doses of PO diazepam and one breakthrough dose of IV diazepam, which has improved his mental status and orientation. There is significant bruising on his left arm, so an x-ray has been ordered for the morning due to tenderness. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8 C, heart rate between 69-117 bpm, blood pressure between 98-162/69-119 mmHg, respiratory rate between 9-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient is currently being treated for ethanol withdrawal/delirium with diazepam. However, there is a risk of developing severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures or delirium tremens if not adequately managed.
2. Infection: Delirium can be caused by various factors, including infection. Despite an initial workup for toxic-metabolic and infectious causes being unrevealing, the possibility of an undiagnosed infection should be considered and monitored for.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, but there"

The patient has no known drug allergies and is receiving infusions of diazepam and other medications. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/86 mmHg to 162/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is hemodynamically stable with normal heart rhythm and adequate fluid balance.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance without acute distress or anxiety. The patient has normal eye and conjunctival findings, normocephalic head, and clear breath sounds. His abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds, and he has warm skin without rash. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movements with normal tone.

Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are slightly elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse and previous episodes of alcohol withdrawal seizures. He is currently in the ICU for ethanol withdrawal and delirium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/80 mmHg to 162/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is alert and oriented, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

The patient has received Valium for agitation, with a current dosage of 15 mg every 4 hours and an additional prn dose of 10 mg overnight. His tachycardia and hypertension have improved. The plan is to taper the Valium slowly, starting with 15 mg Q8, and add Haldol for agitation. Thiamine, folate, and multivitamins are also being given orally.

The patient has a diagnosis of ethanol withdrawal, delirium, hypertension (possibly essential), urinary tract infection (UTI) with Enterococcus, and transaminitis (likely related to EtOH). There is also a concern for possible sinus thrombosis, which was not evident on the initial CT head but may be present on subsequent imaging. The patient's transaminitis is trending down and is believed to be related to EtOH"

The patient's laboratory results show a slightly low white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin and platelet levels, elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows a negative humerus x-ray for fracture, and microbiology results indicate an Enterococcus infection in the urine. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of alcohol withdrawal, delirium, hypertension, possible essential hypertension, urinary tract infection, transaminitis, and feeding tube placement. The patient is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

The patient's condition has improved, with reduced agitation and improved vital signs"
