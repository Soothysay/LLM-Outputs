   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   .
   Primary Care Physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) 593**], [**Name11 (NameIs) 10868**] [**Name12 (NameIs) 10869**] MD
   .
   Chief Complaint:  cough, fever, AMS, and hypotension
   .
   History of Present Illness: 83 year old female with diastolic
   dysfuntion, COPD on 2L NC, OSA, afib on ASA, who presents with AMS and
   hypoxia. The patient notes that she had been feeling well until today.
   She states that around the time her neighbor picked her up to take her
   to her doctor's appointment that she began feeling unwell with
   shortness of breath and cough. She describes her cough as productive of
   light tan sputum. She denies any fever or chills, no N/V/D, no abd
   pain. She does not feel confused.
   .
   Her neighbor took her to [**Hospital1 54**] for outpt evaluation. Her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 593**]
   saw her in the waiting room. Per OMR notes, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10866**] stated that "" She
   is very lethargic and falls asleep during conversation with me.  She
   states that she feels slightly short of breath."" Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 593**] arranged for
   transport to the ED.
   .
   Of note, she was recently discharged on [**12-9**] after an admission for
   viral gastroenteritis and renal failure. She was noted to have
   hypotension to SBP 80's and cr 1.5 both of which responted to fluids
   and was attributed to dehydration in the setting of poor PO intake.
   .
   In the ED, there was a question of facial droop in triage which was not
   present on evaluation in the ED. Her neighbor who was with her on
   arrival at the ED states the patient was wandering around mumbling.The
   patient had fever to 103, cough and hypotension down to SBP 80'S
   requiring 4L NS. Lactate nl 1.3 and 0.9. But given persisent
   hypotension, central line was placed and levophed started.  CXR showed
   multifocal PNA vs edema, but given clinical picture of fever and cough,
   it was thought that she had PNA. The patient was given Vanc, Ceftaz and
   Levofloxacin as well as tamiflu. She was swabed for flu as well. She
   was also noted to be hypoxic to 88% on RA and required 4-5LNC to
   oxygenate 92%. pH 7.32 pCO252 pO2 58.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of diastolic dysfunction, COPD, OSA, and atrial fibrillation. She presents with cough, fever, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension. The patient was found to have multifocal pneumonia on chest X-ray, and her initial labs showed an elevated white blood cell count. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and received IV fluids. Her mental status improved, and her central venous pressure (CVP) increased. However, she remains hypotensive and requires low-dose norepinephrine. Her respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, and she is weaning off levophed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, cough, AMS, and hypotension suggests early sepsis. Multifocal pneumonia seen on the chest X-ray further supports this possibility. It is important to continue IV fluids, monitor blood cultures, and maintain appropriate antibiotic coverage.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's hypoxia requires close monitoring. Continuing nebulized treatments and optimizing her respiratory support may be necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine level suggests possible AKI. It is essential to monitor urine output and electrolyte levels, and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
4. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's diastolic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and peripheral artery disease. She presented with fever, cough, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient received IV fluids overnight and her mental status has resolved. Her central venous pressure is now at 11. She continues to complain of shortness of breath and productive cough, but states that her cough has improved from yesterday. She received 2.5L of IV fluids overnight. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 103/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination findings include bilateral inspiratory crackles and rhonchi in the upper airway, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs or rubs. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal potassium levels. The patient's arterial blood gas reveals a pH of 7.29, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 311, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for possible early sepsis secondary to pneumonia or dehydration, hypoxia potentially due to"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of chronic respiratory failure, hypotension, and multiple comorbidities. They have been admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has a background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema with an acute exacerbation secondary to multifocal pneumonia. They also have chronic diastolic heart failure, anemia, and acute renal function issues. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 140/67 mmHg to 62/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 93%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and purulent sputum suggest a possible bacterial pneumonia on top of influenza (H1N1 positive on tamiflu). This requires close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's pre-existing COPD and the current acute exacerbation, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. This condition can lead to respiratory failure and may require"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic heart failure, and peripheral artery disease (PAF) who presented with fever, cough, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 128/53 mmHg to 170/83 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg. The patient's physical examination reveals increased use of accessory muscles for respiration, bilateral inspiratory crackles, and expiratory wheezing. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza and pneumonia, and treatment includes antibiotics, antiviral medication, and supportive care such as CPAP and diuretics. The patient also has acute renal failure, chronic pain neuropathy, and right upper extremity swelling. She is receiving prophylactic heparin and is on a regular diet.

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and peripheral artery disease who presented with fever, cough, altered mental status, and hypotension. She was found to have early sepsis likely secondary to pneumonia versus dehydration. The patient's hypotension was managed by maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) >90 through the use of intravenous fluids (IVF). Blood cultures and sputum cultures were ordered for further evaluation.

The patient also presented with hypoxia, which was attributed to influenza. She was being treated with Oseltamivir and placed on droplet precautions. Nebulizers with albuterol and ipratropium were also continued. Her altered mental status (AMS) resolved, possibly due to a febrile illness and flu, and she was restarted on gabapentin and morphine. Acute renal failure (ARF) was resolving, likely secondary to dehydration, and IVF was continued with daily trending of creatinine and renal dosing of medications.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was receiving albuterol and ipratropium nebs as well as continuing Flovent. Diastolic heart failure was managed by holding Lisinopril and Lasix. The patient refused to use CPAP at night for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Chronic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic heart failure (HF), and atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with fever, cough, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension. 

The patient's current conditions include hypotension, likely due to early sepsis or dehydration, hypoxia, altered mental status (possibly related to febrile illness and flu), acute renal failure (ARF) that is resolving, likely due to dehydration, COPD, diastolic HF, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and chronic pain neuropathy. 

The plan includes continuing intravenous fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 90, following up with blood cultures and sputum cultures, continuing vancomycin (Vanc), ceftazidime (Ceftaz), and levofloxacin (Levoflox) as treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), administering oseltamivir (Flu) for hypoxia and considering increasing the dose due to improved renal function, implementing droplet precautions, continuing nebulized bronchodilators (nebs) for COPD, monitoring oxygen requirement, restarting gabapentin and morphine for AMS and chronic pain neuropathy, continuing regular diet and repletion of electrolytes"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and PAF who presented with fever, cough, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 128/53 to 160/83 mmHg, heart rate between 91 and 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 95%, and a sinus rhythm heart rhythm.

The patient has been diagnosed with early sepsis, possibly pneumonia versus dehydration, and is being treated with intravenous fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 90. Blood cultures and sputum cultures have been ordered.

The patient also has hypoxia, for which antiviral medication (Flu) has been prescribed, along with droplet precautions, nebulizers, and monitoring of oxygen requirement.

AMS (altered mental status) has resolved, possibly due to febrile illness and flu, and medications such as gabapentin and morphine have been restarted due to improved renal function.

ARF (acute renal failure) is resolving, likely due to dehydration, and the patient will continue with intravenous fluids and daily monitoring of creatinine levels for renal dosing of medications.

The patient has a history of COPD and is being treated with albuterol and ip"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with respiratory distress, fever, cough, altered mental status, and hypotension. She was intubated for respiratory distress.
- The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, likely due to infection and volume overload from flash pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic dysfunction, COPD, and hypertension.
- The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she has not required pressors over the past 24 hours. Her intravenous fluids are being managed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) >90.
- Blood cultures and sputum cultures are being followed up, and antibiotics (Vanc, Ceftaz, and Levoflox) are being continued as treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Oseltamivir is also being continued, with the dose increased due to improved renal function. Droplet precautions are in place, nebulizers are being used, and oxygen requirements are being monitored.
- Repeat chest X-ray and arterial blood gas (ABG) are planned. Diuretic therapy is being held for now, with the goal of achieving euvolemia. Captopril is being started for hypertension.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation who presented with respiratory distress, fever, cough, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension. 

The patient has been diagnosed with likely flash pulmonary edema secondary to intravenous fluid administration for hypotension. The initial plan included repeating a chest X-ray, following up with arterial blood gases (ABG), administering 60mg of Lasix IV, starting captopril for hypertension, and initiating a trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

Over the next 24 hours, the patient's hypotension resolved, and they did not require any pressors. The patient's influenza/pneumonia treatment was continued, along with monitoring blood cultures and sputum cultures. They were also placed on droplet precautions, continued with nebulized treatments, and monitored for oxygen requirements.

The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) has resolved, and they are likely [**3-2**] dehydrated. IV fluids were continued, and the patient's creatinine levels were trending daily for medication dosing adjustments.

The patient's COPD management included standing albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, as well as continuing Flovent. The patient's diastolic heart failure treatment plan started with captopril and Lasix as previously mentioned.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The chief complaint is acute on chronic respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and chronic diastolic heart failure.

The patient was previously awake and agitated, pulling at the endotracheal tube (ETT), which required increased sedation. Currently, the patient is sedated and intubated.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, codeine, and Bactrim (Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim). The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin and ceftazidime.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, morphine sulfate, furosemide, heparin sodium, and other medications for nutritional support and psychiatric/sleep issues.

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/73 mmHg to 145/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation, with settings such as a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expir"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and chronic pain, presenting with fever, cough, hypotension, and altered mental status. She was admitted with respiratory distress and intubated. She has been diagnosed with influenza and likely secondary infection with Staphylococcus aureus. She is currently on ventilatory support and receiving appropriate antibiotics. The patient appears volume overloaded, indicating diastolic heart failure, and needs diuresis with Lasix. She also has hypernatremia, which requires repletion of free water with D5W.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. Extubation may be considered today, but the patient's ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation independently needs to be closely monitored.
2. Influenza/Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with influenza and is likely suffering from a secondary infection with Staphylococcus aureus. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, or other complications related to bacterial infection.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient appears volume overloaded, suggesting diastolic heart failure. If not properly managed, this condition could lead to further fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, or cardiac complications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level of 150 mEq"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with fever, cough, altered mental status, and hypotension, leading to intubation for respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including infection and volume overload due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic dysfunction, COPD, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection:
- The patient has not required pressors over the past 24 hours, indicating that hypotension has resolved.
- IV fluids should be given to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 90 mmHg.
- Blood cultures and sputum cultures should be followed up.
- Continue vancomycin, ceftazidime, and levofloxacin as treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- Continue oseltamivir and increase the dose due to improved renal function.
- Maintain droplet precautions.
- Monitor oxygen requirement.

2. Volume Overload/Diastolic Dysfunction:
- Repeat chest X-ray.
- Follow up arterial blood gas (ABG).
- Hold further diuresis for now, aiming for euvolemia.
- Start captopril for hypertension.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF):
- ARF has resolved and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multilobar pneumonia and respiratory failure. They are unable to provide history due to sedation and intubation. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, and Bactrim. The patient was previously on antibiotics, including Ceftazidime and Vancomycin, but these have been stopped. They are currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and omeprazole. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for fatigue, Foley catheterization, and no pain. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/64 mmHg to 150/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 106 bpm. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 836 mL to 921 mL and output of 81 mL to 230 mL through the thoracic duct, 420 mL to 446 mL through IV fluids, and 1,060 mL to 610 mL through urine.

   1. Respiratory failure
 Failed extubation yesterday, likely [**3-2**]
   extensive pneumonia.  Most recent blood gas shows that patient is being
   hyperventilated (given h/o COPD) and hyperoxygenated.
   - decrease respiratory rate and FIO2
   - recheck blood gas
   2. Influenza/pneumonia
 DFA positive for influenza. Now with likely
   secondary infection with MRSA.
   - continue tamiflu
   - narrow abx to vancomycin; increase vancomycin dose given
   subtherapeutic level
   - droplet, contact precautions
   - f/u cultures
   - continue nebs
   3. Hypotension
 Multifactorial, [**3-2**] sedation, diuresis, and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, presented with fever, cough, hypotension, and altered mental status in the setting of influenza. The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and subsequently developed respiratory failure. She was found to have extensive pneumonia and tested positive for influenza. The patient also has likely secondary infection with MRSA. She required pressors for hypotension, which is multifactorial and possibly due to sepsis and pneumonia. The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest demand ischemia, and serial EKGs are being monitored. Diastolic heart failure, COPD, and neuropathy/chronic pain are also noted. The patient is currently receiving various treatments including antibiotics, antivirals, cardiac enzyme monitoring, and respiratory support. ICU care includes restarting tube feeds and glycemic control. The patient's code status is full code, and she is being cared for in the hospital unit.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's failed extubation and subsequent reintubation indicate significant respiratory distress. The presence of extensive pneumonia suggests a high risk for further respiratory failure if appropriate management is not continued.
2. Influenza/Pneumonia: The patient's DFA positive for influenza indicates an active infection. Secondary infection with MRSA is also suspected. If not appropriately treated, these infections could lead"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and pneumonia. She is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza and is now suspected to have a secondary infection with Staphylococcus aureus. She appears to be volume overloaded on examination. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. She also has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 150.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there may be complications related to prolonged intubation and ventilator use.
2. Influenza/pneumonia: The patient has tested positive for influenza and likely has a secondary bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Complications such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or empyema could arise.
3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient appears volume overloaded, and further management of diastolic heart failure may be required. Possible complications include worsening heart failure or pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of flu and MRSA pneumonia. He underwent invasive ventilation and failed extubation yesterday. Pressors were added, and a new elevated troponin level was noted along with non-specific changes on the EKG. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 140/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving several medications including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, heparin, hydralazine, metoprolol, furosemide, and morphine sulfate. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. The flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to flu and MRSA pneumonia in the setting of O2-dependent emphysema. Continuous ventilator support is required, and the patient may need to be weaned off FiO2 gradually.
2. Reintubation: The patient is likely to require reintubation due to secretions and incompletely treated pneumonia.
3. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock likely due to pneumonia, sedation, and prior di"

","The patient's chief complaint is failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, flu, and MRSA pneumonia. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure caused by the flu and MRSA pneumonia, which is also contributing to O2-dependent emphysema. The patient has been receiving continuous ventilator support and antibiotic therapy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 140/70 mmHg to 155/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.3 K/uL, elevated troponin level of 0.10 ng/mL, and other lab values within normal limits. The chest X-ray reveals worsening right-sided infiltrates.

The patient's plan includes continued ventilator support, ongoing antibiotic therapy, and weaning off norepinephrine as tolerated. The patient will continue to be monitored in the ICU for respiratory failure, shock, and other potential complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, and atelectasis. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adherence to proper ventilation strategies are crucial to minimize these risks."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of flu and MRSA pneumonia. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and the need for pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient experienced a cardiac event, as indicated by an elevated troponin level and non-specific changes on the EKG. The patient also has a history of emphysema, which contributes to the respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the flu and MRSA pneumonia, exacerbated by underlying emphysema. The patient is currently on continuous mechanical ventilation support.
2. Shock: The patient is suspected to be in shock, possibly due to pneumonia, sedation, and prior diuresis. The patient is on levophed (norepinephrine) to maintain blood pressure.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The positive troponin level suggests myocardial injury or demand ischemia. Further evaluation through EKG and cardiac enzyme markers is recommended.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to prolonged intubation. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She presented with fever, cough, hypotension, and altered mental status, and was found to have respiratory failure, likely secondary to extensive pneumonia. She is currently intubated and being treated for Staphylococcus pneumonia with appropriate antibiotics.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and failed extubation indicate a high risk for continued respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation status is essential.

2. Influenza/pneumonia: The patient has tested positive for influenza, and there is a likely secondary infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any worsening of the infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been off pressors, maintaining pressures, and it is important to continue monitoring blood pressures and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

4. Elevated troponin: The patient has an elevated troponin level, suggesting possible myocardial ischemia. However, the CK-MB levels are stable and there is no evidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) on the EKG. Close monitoring and further evaluation may be"

   extensive pneumonia.  Most recent blood gas shows that patient is being
   hyperventilated (given h/o COPD) and hyperoxygenated.
   - decrease respiratory rate and FIO2
   - recheck blood gas
   2. Influenza/pneumonia
 DFA positive for influenza. Now with likely
   secondary infection with MRSA.
   - continue tamiflu
   - narrow abx to vancomycin; increase vancomycin dose given
   subtherapeutic level
   - droplet, contact precautions

- Assessment and Plan: Respiratory failure, Influenza/pneumonia, Hypotension, Elevated troponin, Diastolic heart failure, COPD, Neuropathy/chronic pain

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient's condition may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Influenza/pneumonia - The patient may develop complications such as sepsis or secondary infections due to influenza and pneumonia.
3. Hypotension - The patient's blood pressure may continue to be unstable, leading to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.
4. Elevated troponin - This indicates possible myocardial ischemia or injury, which may progress to myocardial infarction if not addressed.
5. Diastolic heart failure - The patient's heart function may deteriorate further, leading to fluid accumulation and pulmonary edema.
6. COPD exacerbation - The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to the respiratory distress and pneumonia.
7. Neuropathy/chronic pain - The patient's neuropathic pain management requires attention to prevent discomfort and potential complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to flu and MRSA pneumonia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation support. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/63 to 150/130 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of atrial fibrillation.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl and midazolam for sedation, lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, and antibiotics for the treatment of MRSA pneumonia.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Blood gases indicate a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 366, and respiratory rate (RR) set at 12 breaths per minute. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's chest X-ray shows stable bilateral infiltrates, consistent with his diagnosis of respiratory failure.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory failure due to flu and MRSA pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CH"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to flu and MRSA pneumonia in the setting of O2-dependent emphysema. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation support. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 125/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CMV mode ventilation.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for a positive troponin, which raises suspicion for myocardial ischemia. The patient's physical examination reveals minimal wheezes and crackles on the right lung, a benign abdomen with positive bowel sounds, and no extremity edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, platelet count of 334 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 133 mg/dL, and a serum albumin of 2.9 g/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to flu and MRSA pneumonia in the setting of O2-dependent emphysema. The patient requires continuous ventilator support, continuous antibiotics, MDIs, slow respiratory rate, and weaning of FiO2. Reintubation is likely due to secretions and incompletely treated pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing shock likely due to pneumonia, sedation, and prior diuresis. The patient is on levophed and making urine, with plans to wean as tolerated and use IV fluids judiciously. CHF is being managed to keep the patient stable as the pressor dose decreases. A positive troponin suggests possible demand ischemia, and the patient's EKG and troponin levels will be closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to flu and MRSA pneumonia, and he requires continuous ventilator support. The risk of respiratory failure may persist if the underlying pneumonia is not adequately treated.
2. Reintubation: The patient's reintubation is likely due to secretions and incompletely treated pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory complications if these issues are not addressed.
3. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock likely due to pneumonia, sedation, and prior diuresis. This increases the risk of organ dysfunction and potential mortality.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient"

The patient has received multiple medications including antibiotics, pain relief, and sedation. 

24-hour events include an EKG at 11:15 AM, as well as changes in medications and infusions. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,369 mL and output of 1,476 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 35%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.43, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 366 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 9.8 L/min.

Physical examination reveals an intubated and sedated patient with supple neck, regular heart rate, minimal wheezes and crackles on the right lung, benign abdomen, and no extremity edema. Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) at 9.4 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count at 10.3 K/uL, platelet (Plt) count at 334 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 0.7 mg/dL, troponin-T at 0.10 ng/mL, blood glucose at 133 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab values include elevated PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, lactic acid, and decreased albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels.

Assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure due to flu and MRSA pneumonia, shock likely due to pneumonia, sedation, and prior diuresis. The patient is on levophed, making urine, and will be weaned off as tolerated. There is also concern for possible ischemia due to a positive troponin result, and follow-up EKG and troponin levels are recommended. The patient is receiving nutrition through a pulmonary formula, glycemic control"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and chronic pain. She presented with fever, cough, hypotension, and altered mental status in the setting of influenza, leading to intubation for respiratory distress.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory distress and has failed extubation twice. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if proper ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained.

2. Influenza/pneumonia: The patient has tested positive for influenza and is likely to have secondary infection with MRSA. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia and sepsis if appropriate antibiotics and infection control measures are not continued.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been off Levophed and no longer requires pressor support. However, there is a risk of recurrent hypotension, especially in the setting of diastolic heart failure and other comorbidities. Close monitoring of blood pressure and maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 is essential.

4. Elevated troponin: The patient has an elevated troponin level, suggesting possible ischemia. If the troponin levels continue to rise or do not normalize, it may indicate ongoing myocardial damage or ischemia.

5. Diastolic heart failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (not on coumadin), who presented with fever, cough, hypotension, and altered mental status in the setting of influenza. The patient was intubated for respiratory distress.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely secondary to extensive pneumonia, for which she is being treated with appropriate antibiotics. She also has influenza, as confirmed by DFA testing, and a secondary infection with MRSA. The patient is on Tamiflu and vancomycin, and contact precautions are being followed.

The patient also has hypotension, which is currently off Levophed and no longer requires pressor support. The blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be monitored to maintain a MAP of more than 65.

There is an elevated troponin level, indicating possible demand ischemia, but stable CK-MB levels and an EKG without evidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) suggest that ACS is not present.

The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Diuretics and beta-blockers will be used for rate control if atrial fibrillation occurs.

The patient also has COPD, for which she is receiving albuterol and ipratropium nebs, as well as Flovent. She is also taking"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with history of COPD, A-fib, CVA admitted with pneumonia
   with positive influenza swab now with extubation attempt complicated by
   significant pulmonary edema.  She has been maintained on PSV support
   without evidence of significant negative fluid balance to date.  She
   this morning has CVP-7, some inspiratory fall and variation in pulse
   pressure with inspiration all arguing for relative hypovolemia.  She
   does retain significant bronchospasm with with previous failure patient
   did have secretions, tachypnea and persistent bronchospasm she did
   fail.
   1)Respiratory Failure-For treatment based on above, will
   Continue
   -Tamiflu
until 7 days post fever
   -Vanco
   Maintain even fluid balance
   2)Atrial Fibrillation
she has atrial flutter this morning
   -Will continue with rate control as needed but well tolerated through
   to this morning
   3)Congestive Heart Failure
Systolic acute and chronic
   -Keep fluid balance even today.

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presented with fever, cough, hypotension, and altered mental status in the setting of influenza. The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/79 mmHg to 105/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation. The patient has atrial fibrillation with an irregular rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,970 mL and output of 1,375 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving fluids through intravenous and total parenteral nutrition. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 574 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 121.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 324 K/uL, blood glucose level of 116 mg/dL, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 51 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 409 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 98%.

The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia with an irregular rhythm, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and bowel sounds present. The patient's chest sounds less rhonchous anteriorly today.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure likely due to extensive pneumonia, influenza infection confirmed by DFA, and secondary infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient is being treated with appropriate antibiotics and antiviral medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration in the patient's cardiac status, and possible spread of MRSA infection."

The patient has had some complications during her ICU stay, including failed extubation three days ago, likely due to extensive pneumonia. The patient is now being weaned off the ventilator, with a trial of pressure support (PS) 5/5 this morning. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is favorable for extubation, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) will be followed to monitor progress. If the patient tolerates PS 5/5,"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with initial admission for respiratory failure secondary
   to pneumonia with failed extubation during hospitalization.  She has
   had limited capacity to wean further in PSV with tachypnea limiting
   wean.  On exam she has limited evidence of persistent significant
   volume overload.  We have, encouragingly, seen some substantial
   improvement in oxygenation noted across past 24 hours.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with improved tolerance of PSV through to
   this morning.  We have RSBi-47, we have NIF=-45, we have patient
   euvolemic.  This is all favorable for extubation.
   -We will leave on [**6-2**] and check ABG to evaluate tolerance at 1 hour
   -Will continue with PSV today
   -We have decreased secretions noted through to today and improved CXR
   -With favorable ABG we will have to consider trial of extubation
   -Will move to intermittent positive pressure support if needed post
   extubation
   -Continue negative 500cc or even fluid balance.
   2)Pneumonia-
   -Tamiflu in place
   -Will continue with ABX
   -Follow culture results
   -Do see improvement in secretion volume this morning

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. She underwent failed extubation during hospitalization and has had limited capacity to wean further in pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to tachypnea, limiting her wean. On examination, she shows limited evidence of persistent significant volume overload.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has improved tolerance of PSV and favorable indices for extubation, including a respiratory system compliance (RSBi) of 47, negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -45, and euvolemia. The plan is to continue with PSV today, decrease secretions, and improve chest X-ray (CXR). If the patient tolerates extubation well, she may be extubated, with the possibility of moving to intermittent positive pressure support if needed post-extubation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is receiving Tamiflu and antibiotics for pneumonia. Culture results are pending, and there is improvement in secretion volume this morning.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated conditions, infection-related ventilator-associated complications, and possible/likely ventilator-associated events
- Barotrauma
- Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)
- Oxygen toxicity
- Sedation-related complications

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She presented with fever, cough, hypotension, and altered mental status, and was intubated for respiratory distress. She is currently extubated and on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula. Her vital signs are stable, but she continues to produce a lot of phlegm. She is mildly hypertensive and is being treated with captopril. She also has agitation, for which she is receiving Haldol and zydis. The patient has a positive DFA for influenza and likely secondary MRSA infection. She is on day 9 of a 10-day course of Tamiflu and Vancomycin. Her troponin levels are elevated, suggesting possible ischemia, but no chest pain is reported. She has a history of diastolic heart failure and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which she is receiving captopril and diuretics. She also has a history of COPD, for which she is receiving albuterol and ipratropium nebs, as well as Flovent. The patient is anemic with a Hct of 26, and her neuropathy/chronic pain is being managed with neurontin. The patient's lines and prophylaxis measures are noted, and she is being monitored for VAP."

   ggt (had that on for comfort during extubation), added on 6.25mg
   captopril TID (she's on 5 of lisinopril at home), she got 60mg IV lasix
   x1 in the AM, shes on 60mg PO at home, can maybe add this back tmrw
   -agitated at night, gave 0.5mg haldol x2, and 5mg zytis
   (pt really needs to rest as she hasnt slept in days and her anxiety

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presented with fever, cough, hypotension, and altered mental status. She was intubated for respiratory distress and diagnosed with influenza and pneumonia. The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status, but still has ongoing volume loss in the right upper lobe. She is currently being treated for Staphylococcus pneumonia with appropriate antibiotics, including Vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/42 mmHg to 150/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 96%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine and lactic acid levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for low potassium. The patient's troponin levels are no longer trending upward, suggesting no ongoing ischemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, especially considering her history of COPD. There is a risk of reintubation if she fails extubation again.
2. Influenza/pneumonia: The patient's influenza and pneumonia should be closely monitored for any signs"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with significant cardiac disease who has been admitted with respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia (influenza), underlying congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive lung disease. The patient requires home oxygen therapy.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient will continue to be encouraged to cough, take deep breaths, and increase mobility to aid in secretion clearance. Underlying causes of respiratory failure, such as pneumonia and congestive heart failure, will be treated accordingly.

2. Pneumonia: The patient will continue taking Tamiflu and vancomycin to treat the pneumonia.

3. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has shown good tolerance of diuresis and has been able to maintain stable blood pressure and creatinine levels. The patient will continue with mild negative fluid balance.
