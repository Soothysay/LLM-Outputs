   - Contact[**Name (NI) **] Radius re: pt's baseline (talked to nurse [**Last Name (Titles) 141**]): pt was
   living at home with daughter, was ambulating however not speaking much
   and had functional decline.  Then was at [**Hospital1 **] in [**Month (only) 11**] to [**May 2151**] and was
   thought to have ALS with frontotemporal component. After discharge, pt
   was sent to Radius. There she is not ambulatory (tried initially but
   unsuccessful), does not speak.  Seems to have some cognition, i.e. will
   follow you with eyes, reach out her hand for glucose checks, listens
   and moves to music while lying in bed.  Of note, during 45 min of CPR
   during PEA arrest, pt did receive 1 Amp of Epi.
   - per family, patient does communicate at baseline with eyes only.
   family says they may consider withdrawing care, pending no improvement
   in pt's mental status. family is considering funeral arrangements now.
   but still FULL CODE and DO EVERYTHING.

 CARDIAC ARREST
   53F with amyotrohic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia
   admitted after 45 minutes of CPR for a PEA arrest as well as possible
   STEMI on Artic Sun protocol and aspiration PNA on antibiotics.
   # PEA arrest: Etiology is likely aspiration PNA leading to STEMI.
   - Initial therpeutic hypothermia with the Artic Sun protocol, now
   starting to warm up gradually
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Has [**Month/Year (2) 865**] and central line in place
   - wean sedatives and paralytics today
   - monitor electrolytes, coags, and CBC Q6H then [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue surveillence daily BCx
   - Maintain MAP>90 for CNS perfusion
   - Currently only on norepinephrine
   - Will use fluid boluses for hypotension and try to wean pressor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following 45 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). She has a history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with frontotemporal dementia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, septic shock requiring vasopressor support, and evidence of aspiration pneumonia (APN). She also has an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with ST elevations in leads II, III, and V3-6, but no indication for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to the aspiration pneumonia and may require continued mechanical ventilation support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock indicates an ongoing infection, likely from the aspiration pneumonia. She is already receiving appropriate antibiotics but requires close monitoring and potential adjustment of the treatment.
3. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): Although the ST elevations suggest an AMI, there is no indication for PCI. The patient will be maintained on aspirin and other cardiac medications as per the cardiology consultation.
4. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's low blood pressure and the need for vasopressor support indicate potential organ hypoperfusion. Monitoring of organ function and maintaining adequate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of ALS and frontotemporal dementia who presented to the ICU after experiencing a cardiopulmonary arrest. She was successfully resuscitated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with STEMI and aspiration pneumonia. She is receiving treatment for these conditions, including anticoagulation therapy and antibiotics. The patient's family is considering withdrawing care due to her poor mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential sepsis.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's STEMI and ongoing cardiac dysfunction may lead to arrhythmias, heart failure, or other cardiac events.
3. Multiorgan dysfunction: Due to the patient's severe illness and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of multiorgan dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, and pulmonary dysfunction.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness, sedation, and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation increases the risk of VAP.
7. Cognitive decline: The patient's preexisting frontotemporal dementia may worsen"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who presented with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and required prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). She was found to have mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with preserved systolic function on an echocardiogram.

The patient has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics (azithromycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin), heparin sodium, norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam. She is also receiving pantoprazole in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 35.1°C, heart rate (HR) of 74 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 102/50 mmHg to 118/68 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 6,183 mL and output of 2,865 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,318 mL. She is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube connected to a ventilator, which is set at a tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 10 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 410 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is thin, with poor eye contact, normal heart sounds, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and unresponsive neurologic status. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 22.7 thousand/mm3, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count (Plt) of 241 thousand/mm3, elevated troponin T level of 0.02 ng/mL, and elevated lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L. Other laboratory values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, and efforts are being made to rewarm her. Sedation can be tapered off throughout the day.
2. Severe Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and has bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray. Increased hot neutrophil requirements"

   spoke with Neuro and decided to load pt w. Keppra 20mg/kg and start
   Keppra 1000 [**Hospital1 **]. Her EEG will be evaluated by an epilepsy attending in
   the AM. This appeared to stop the jerks, but difficult to tell.
   -Pt became tachycardic, reaching a peak of 150s, in the early evening;
   ECG showed sinus tach. DDX: seizures or beta blocker withdrawal in
   setting of levophed drip (as pt on Metop 75 [**Hospital1 **] at home), less likely
   hypovolemia (although we did transfuse the pt 1 unit PRBCs for HCT

   of HR to 90s.
   - Became tachy to 140s again this AM, clearly sinus on monitor, tried

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia admitted after experiencing cardiac arrest.
- She was resuscitated for 45 minutes and also had a possible ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
- The patient has developed pneumonia due to aspiration, for which she is already on antibiotics.
- She is currently being treated for sepsis without organ dysfunction and is receiving therapeutic hypothermia for the cardiac arrest.
- The patient's condition is unstable, and she is dependent on vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.
- She is mechanically ventilated and has a tracheostomy in place.
- The patient's neurological status is unchanged, with ongoing seizure activity.
- Her lab results show normal renal function but abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for low magnesium levels.
- Microbiology cultures are pending, including blood, urine, and sputum cultures.
- Imaging studies reveal bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, consistent with aspiration.
- The patient's family is open to changing her code status if necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's current treatment for sepsis indicates a systemic infection that may progress to septic shock if not effectively managed.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing"

   - Seizures: Pt was noted to have repetitive jerking motions of bilat
   feet w. eye deviation this afternoon, in association w. ? generalized
   discharges on EEG monitoring. Pt was given ativan 1mg IV x2 and we
   spoke with Neuro and decided to load pt w. Keppra 20mg/kg and start
   Keppra 1000 [**Hospital1 **]. Her EEG will be evaluated by an epilepsy attending in
   the AM. This appeared to stop the jerks, but difficult to tell.
   -Pt became tachycardic, reaching a peak of 150s, in the early evening;
   ECG showed sinus tach. DDX: seizures or beta blocker withdrawal in
   setting of levophed drip (as pt on Metop 75 [**Hospital1 **] at home), less likely
   hypovolemia (although we did transfuse the pt 1 unit PRBCs for HCT
   26.2) or pain/anxiety (as pt still sedated).  Dc'ed levophed, started
   neo, transfused 1U. Also treated szs as noted above, with improvement
   of HR to 90s.
   - Became tachy to 140s again this AM, clearly sinus on monitor, tried
   Ativan 1mg x2, although pt was not twitching. Also gave Midaz. Also
   bolused the pt 500cc. Also, has temp to 100.4.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. She was admitted after experiencing a 45-minute cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and underwent the Arctic Sun protocol. The patient also has aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and is currently on antibiotics.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Sinus tachycardia: The patient is experiencing a high heart rate, which may be due to several factors such as hypovolemia/bleeding, pulmonary embolism (neg CTA, on prophylaxis), pain/anxiety (on fentanyl), seizure activity, or reflex tachycardia from discontinuation of sedatives.

2. s/p PEA arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and the etiology is likely aspiration PNA. She has completed the Arctic Sun protocol.

3. STEMI: The patient's admission electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST elevations in leads II, III, V3-6; however, cardiac enzymes are negative, and the echocardiogram did not show hypokinesis. The patient has been taken off aspirin.

4. Aspiration PNA: The patient has infiltrates on chest X-ray and frank aspiration in endotracheal suction. She is being treated with Vancomycin 1g IV B"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. She was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest and received resuscitation efforts. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, on antibiotics, and is being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's immune system is compromised due to ALS and pneumonia, making her susceptible to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes widespread inflammation.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and had ST elevations on the ECG, indicating potential cardiac damage. This increases the risk of further cardiac events, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's lab results show abnormalities in sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium levels, which can affect various bodily functions and lead to complications if not corrected promptly.
5. Seizures: The patient had seizure activity, and ongoing EEG monitoring is being conducted to assess the need for antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
7. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged bed rest increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can complicate wound healing and lead to infections.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to ALS and prolonged immobilization, potentially requiring nutritional support.

These potential medical complications should be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's well-being in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and cardiac arrest. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and heart medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's ALS diagnosis and current mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Frequent suctioning and careful monitoring of her respiratory status are important to prevent further respiratory issues.

2. Infection: The patient has already developed aspiration pneumonia, which requires ongoing antibiotic treatment. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of blood cultures are necessary to identify any new infections.

3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has had a cardiac arrest and showed ST elevations on the ECG, suggesting possible myocardial infarction. However, cardiac enzymes were negative, and an echocardiogram did not show hypokinesis. Regular monitoring of cardiac status and ongoing assessment of cardiac enzymes are important to evaluate for any cardiac complications.

4. Neurological Complications: Given the patient's ALS and frontotemporal dementia, there is a risk of neurological decline. Monitoring of neurological status, including regular neurologic examinations and EEG results, is essential"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. She was admitted after experiencing a prolonged cardiac arrest (PEA arrest), successfully resuscitated, and diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. She has been on antibiotics since admission.

The patient is currently experiencing sinus tachycardia, which may be attributed to hypovolemia, pulmonary embolism (PE), pain/anxiety, seizure activity, or reflex tachycardia from discontinuation of sedatives. The differential diagnosis for tachycardia is broad. The patient has improved following administration of Tylenol and metoprolol.

The patient has a history of PEA arrest, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. She completed the Arctic Sun protocol and is currently on telemonitoring. Her electrolytes, coagulation profile, and complete blood count (CBC) should be monitored closely. She is off pressors and being maintained with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 90 for cerebral perfusion.

The patient previously experienced a suspected STEMI, but cardiac enzymes were negative, and an echocardiogram did not show any hypokinesis. Aspirin was discontinued, and the patient continues to be monitored on telemetry.

The patient has aspiration pneumonia with infiltrates on chest X-ray and frank aspiration in endotracheal suction. She"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia admitted to the ICU after experiencing a prolonged cardiac arrest. She received resuscitative efforts, including CPR, and completed the Arctic Sun protocol. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, which is likely the cause of her cardiac arrest. She is currently on antibiotics and being closely monitored. The patient also has sinus tachycardia, possibly due to hypovolemia, pain/anxiety, or seizure activity. Her cardiac enzymes were negative repeatedly, and an echocardiogram did not show any hypokinesis. The patient's goals of care need to be discussed with the neurology team, and an EEG result is pending. The patient's electrolytes, coagulation profile, and complete blood count should be monitored daily. The patient's mental status should be followed up with neurology recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory complications such as worsening lung consolidation or development of new infections.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia may progress to other arrhythmias due to underlying cardiac issues or electrolyte imbalances.
3. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and history of ALS increase the risk of seizure activity.
4. Sepsis: The ongoing infection from aspiration pneumonia can lead to systemic inflammation and se"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia who was admitted after experiencing a prolonged cardiac arrest (PEA arrest) and received CPR for 45 minutes. She completed the Arctic Sun protocol and was found to have aspiration pneumonia (PNA), for which she is being treated with antibiotics.

The patient's current condition includes sinus tachycardia, which is being monitored and treated accordingly. Her fever overnight is being managed with Tylenol and close monitoring. The aspiration PNA is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn, and she is also on azithromycin. Blood cultures have been sent, and frequent suctioning is being performed.

The patient's medical history includes a recent STEMI, which has since resolved, and she does not have any acute interventions planned for her ALS with frontotemporal dementia. The family is open to changing the patient's code status pending her mental status after the recent event. The neurology team's recommendations and the results of the EEG are being awaited.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. However, there is a possibility of developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization.
2. Cardiac issues: Although the recent STEMI has resolved, the patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored for any potential complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ALS and frontotemporal dementia who was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol and now shows signs of likely aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and absence of cortical activity on EEG.

The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics for MRSA and GNR infections, as well as other supportive care medications. His vital signs are stable, but he has a fever and continues to show evidence of aspiration. His respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist and auto flow modes.

The physical examination reveals a patient who is not alert, with eyes squinting to light. There are no murmurs or wheezes noted, and the abdomen is soft with hypoactive bowel sounds. Extremities show right lower extremity ex-fixation with a bloody bandage and palpable distal pulses.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and microbiology tests have shown negative results for Legionella in the urine and no Clostridium difficile (C. diff) in the stool.

Radiology shows new chest X-rays with unchanged infiltrates and evidence of aspiration. The assessment and plan include recommendations for neurology follow-up regarding prognosis, arranging a family meeting"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ALS and frontotemporal dementia who was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He underwent active spontaneous resuscitation (ARTS) post-arrest protocol. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia caused by MRSA. There are no electrographic seizures captured during the 24-hour EEG recording, but there is a notable absence of any clear cerebral cortical activity. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), a heart rate ranging from 66 to 121 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 65 to 140 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 10 to 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently within normal range. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and mildly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results, including electrolyte levels, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits. The patient's microbiology tests have not shown any positive results for Legionella, Clostridium difficile, or other infections.

The patient's radiology results include a new chest X-ray showing infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia. 

The assessment and plan include continued treatment for aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin and"

- Laboratory Results: Showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and slightly elevated platelet count. Other lab results were within normal ranges.
- Microbiology: Sputum culture was positive for MRSA, while urine culture was negative for Legionella and catheter tip culture was negative. Stool cultures did not show the presence of C. difficile.
- Radiology: A new chest X-ray revealed unchanged infiltrates with evidence of aspiration.
- Assessment and Plan: The patient is likely suffering from aspiration pneumonia and has shown a notable absence of cortical activity on EEG. The plan includes continuing with supportive care, arranging a family meeting to discuss the results of the EEG, and providing appropriate antibiotics for AP/VAP.
- Other plans include following up with neurology recommendations regarding prognosis, arranging a family meeting to discuss the results of the EEG, and managing the patient's ALS with frontotemporal dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe anoxic brain injury: The prolonged downtime during the PEA arrest has resulted in severe brain injury, as indicated by the absence of cortical activity on EEG.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration during mechanical ventilation has led to the development of pneumonia, which is confirmed by sputum culture positive for MRSA.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, which is suspected given the fever and unchanged infiltrates on chest X-ray.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient is at risk of acquiring additional nosocomial infections due to his prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures.
5. C. difficile infection: Although the stool cultures have been negative so far, there is still a risk of developing C. difficile infection due to the use of antibiotics.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT, which needs to be monitored for and prevented with appropriate prophylaxis.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and immobilization put him at risk for stress ulcer bleeding, requiring prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)."

In terms of medication, the patient has received various antibiotics such as Azithromycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Ciprofloxacin. Additionally, the patient is receiving Pantoprazole (Protonix) and Insulin - Humalog.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following changes: ""Tmax: 37 C (98.6 F), Tcurrent: 36.9 C (98.4 F), HR: 97 (58 - 121) bpm, BP: 153/88 (105) mmHg, RR: 10 (10 - 22) insp/min, SpO2: 100%, Heart rhythm: SR (Sinus Rhythm).""

Flowsheet data as of 2151-12-1 06:24 AM shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other parameters. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 451 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 10, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and spontaneous RR of 0. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, and PaO2 of 103 mmHg. The patient's blood glucose level is 106 mg/dL.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment, all of which were not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hematocrit (Hct) and platelet count (Plt), and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++), as well as elevated sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels.

Assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, electrolyte & fluid disorder, tachycardia, pneumonia (aspiration), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and cardiac arrest. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and potential worsening of the patient's sepsis or infection due to the presence of pseudomonas in the sputum culture."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ALS and frontotemporal dementia who was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest with prolonged downtime. He underwent the Arctic Sun post-arrest protocol. The patient has been diagnosed with a pseudomonal/MRSA pneumonia and now exhibits an absence of cortical activity on EEG, indicating severe anoxic brain injury.

24-hour events include a discussion with the daughter regarding EEG results, the growth of Pseudomonas in the sputum culture, and the placement of a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for the MRSA and Pseudomonas infection. Blood and sputum cultures have been ordered, and the antibiotic regimen will be tailored based on the sensitivities.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate between 58-121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-153/53-89 mmHg, respiratory rate at 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 13.7-15.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels"
