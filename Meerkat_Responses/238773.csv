   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ PMHx HTN, COPD presents with respiratory failure, now
   transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**] with respiratory failure s/p intubation,
   NSTEMI, and hypotension requiring pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Current picture most consistent with NSTEMI. Patient has
   no known cardiac history, risk factors include smoking and HTN. EKG
   shows 1st degree AV block, inferior Q waves and <1mm STE present since
   admission to OSH, with new TwI in lateral leads c/w ischemia/NSTEMI
   without meeting criteria for STEMI. Patient denies chest pain. Echo
   shows hypokinesis in all areas except for the base, and LVEF 30-35%,
   but not consistent with territory of EKG changes. Biomarkers elevated,
   CK at 626, continuing to rise, troponin peaked at 0.685 now trending
   down.
   - cont to trend CE to peak, repeat at midnight, 6 am
   - Plavix 600 mg load now and then 75 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - ASA 325 mg, start simvastatin 80 mg
   - hold beta-blocker, ACEi for hypotension
   - repeat EKG
   - cath lab if clinical deterioration
   .
   # PUMP:  Volume status appears euvolemic-hypovolemic, no crackles on
   exam, CXR WNL. [**Month (only) 11**] need continued hydration to support
   shock/vasodilation picture. No evidence of overload s/p 6L fluids.
   - f/u echo read
   - cont IVF boluses as needed, 500cc now and then as indicated by
   exam/CXR to avoid overload
   - daily CXR
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, sinus.
   - Cont to monitor on tele
   .
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has severe COPD on home O2 (history
   unvalidated, per OSH notes), with hyperinflation on CXR and presenting
   symptoms very c/w COPD flare (tripod position, wheezing) and reported
   not taking meds at home. A-a gradient elevated at 124. No evidence of
   PNA on CXR, afebrile but is currently still on levaquin.
   - Remain intubated in setting of shock of unknown etiology, switch to
   Fentanyl/Versed for sedation
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs, Solumedrol, abx)
   - Consider discontinuing abx if no evidence of PNA
   - daily CXRs
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient maintained borderline adequate SBP's with
   aggressive IVF hydration of [**5-26**] L (per report, at OSH). Started on
   pressors during transport. However, patient was also on propofol which
   could not be weaned and may have contributed to hypotension. Most
   likely cause of shock is mixed picture including component of
   cardiogenic shock (with acutely elevated cardiac biomarkers, has low
   EF, however, has warm, well-perfused extremities) with vasodilatory
   state, such as septic shock, since patient is requiring high volumes of
   IVF and continues to be hypotensive. No obvious cause of sepsis, UA
   WNL, CXR clear. Hypovolemia may be a component of picture since COPD
   flare and decreased PO intake, but not likely the major etiology as
   patient was aggressively hydrated without improvement. No hx suggestive
   of anaphylactic shock.
   - wean Levophed as tolerated, with IVF boluses prn to maintain SBP>90
   and MAP>60.
   - A-line now to closely monitor hemodynamics, also closely monitor
   markers of end organ perfusion such as UOP and bolus for UOP<30cc/hr,
   trend lactate
   - WBC 22 with left shift, but on high dose steroids, trend
   - f/u blood cx
   - monitor exam for localizing signs of infxn
   - consider central IJ line which would allow CVP monitoring, but has
   clean femoral line in place for now (placed afternoon [**7-24**])
   - switch propofol to Versed/Fentanyl
   - cont Levaquin day #2
   .
   # Acid-base disturbance: Patient initially presented with ABG c/w
   respiratory acidosis. Now has primary resp acidosis with concurrent
   metabolic acidosis, non-AG. Respiratory component due to acute on
   chronic CO2 retention in the setting of COPD. Non-gap metabolic
   acidosis most likely due to receiving large amount of IVF over 24 hrs.
   - serial ABGs
   - follow lytes, gap, consider using bicarb for fluids if patient
   remains with severe non gap metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Psych: Holding home Ativan and mirtazipine.
   .
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx, monitor for now
   .
   FEN: Replete lytes, monitor fingersticks, HISS while on steroids, NPO
   for now, OG in place
   .
   ACCESS: R femoral line in place at transfer

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension (HTN) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and hypotension requiring pressors.

2. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 92/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

3. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with the following settings: tidal volume (TV) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 29 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O.

4. The patient has an arterial line, central venous pressure (CVP) line, and urinary catheter in place for monitoring and management.

5. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 22.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 41.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 193 K/uL, troponin-T level of 0.51 ng/mL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.1 mg/dL, and lactate level of 1.8 mmol/L.

6. The patient's cardiac biomarkers are elevated, consistent with NSTEMI. An echocardiogram shows hypokinesis in all areas except for the base, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30-35%. The EKG shows inferior Q waves and new T wave inversion in the lateral leads, indicating ischemia/NSTEMI.

7. The patient's acid-base disturbance consists of primary respiratory acidosis due to acute on chronic CO2 retention in the setting of COPD, along with a non-gap metabolic acidosis likely due to receiving a large amount of intravenous fluids.

8. The patient's mental status is described as sedated, and he is receiving propofol for sedation, which may contribute to hypotension. He is also on levaquin for possible pneumonia, although the chest X-ray is clear.

9. The patient's skin care is a concern, as there is a possible developing ulcer below the coccyx.

10. The patient's glycemic control is being monitored due to his NPO status and steroid use.

11. The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, septic shock, development of pressure ulcers, nosocomial infections such as VAP, and DVT."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ PMHx HTN, COPD presents with respiratory failure, now
   transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**] with respiratory failure s/p intubation,
   NSTEMI, and hypotension requiring pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Current picture most consistent with NSTEMI.  Most
   likely demand related ischemia in the setting of a severe COPD flare.
   Patient denies chest pain. Echo shows hypokinesis in all areas except
   for the base, and LVEF 30-35%, but not consistent with territory of EKG
   changes. Biomarkers now trending down.
   - Plavix 75 mg, ASA 325 mg, simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - hold beta-blocker, ACEi for hypotension
   - repeat EKG
   - probable PCI before discharge
   - wean pressors with goal MAP > 60.
   .
   # PUMP:  Volume status appears euvolemic-hypovolemic, no crackles on
   exam, CXR WNL. [**Month (only) 11**] need continued hydration to support
   shock/vasodilation picture. No evidence of overload s/p 6L fluids.
   Echo shows EF of 30% with severe LV and RV systolic dysfunction.
   - cont IVF boluses as needed, 500cc now and then as indicated by
   exam/CXR to avoid overload
   - daily CXR
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, sinus.
   - Cont to monitor on tele
   .
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has severe COPD on home O2 (history
   unvalidated, per OSH notes), with hyperinflation on CXR and presenting
   symptoms very c/w COPD flare (tripod position, wheezing) and reported
   not taking meds at home. A-a gradient elevated at 124. No evidence of
   PNA on CXR, afebrile but is currently still on levaquin.
   - Remain intubated in setting of shock of unknown etiology, switch to
   Fentanyl/Versed for sedation.
   - Consider trial of pressure support this afternoon.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs, Solumedrol, abx)
   - Continue abx, day [**3-25**].
   - daily CXRs
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient maintained borderline adequate SBP's with
   aggressive IVF hydration of [**5-26**] L (per report, at OSH). Started on
   pressors during transport. However, patient was also on propofol which
   could not be weaned and may have contributed to hypotension. Most
   likely cause of shock is mixed picture including component of
   cardiogenic shock (with acutely elevated cardiac biomarkers, has low
   EF, however, has warm, well-perfused extremities) with vasodilatory
   state, such as septic shock, since patient is requiring high volumes of
   IVF and continues to be hypotensive. No obvious cause of sepsis, UA
   WNL, CXR clear. Hypovolemia may be a component of picture since COPD
   flare and decreased PO intake, but not likely the major etiology as
   patient was aggressively hydrated without improvement. No hx suggestive
   of anaphylactic shock.
   - wean Levophed as tolerated, with IVF boluses prn to maintain SBP>90
   and MAP>60.
   - A-line now to closely monitor hemodynamics, also closely monitor
   markers of end organ perfusion such as UOP and bolus for UOP<30cc/hr,
   trend lactate
   - WBC 22 with left shift, but on high dose steroids, trend
   - f/u blood cx
   - monitor exam for localizing signs of infxn
   - d/c femoral line as soon as possible, main peripheral venous access.
   .
   # Acid-base disturbance: Patient initially presented with ABG c/w
   respiratory acidosis. Now has primary resp acidosis with concurrent
   metabolic acidosis, non-AG. Respiratory component due to acute on
   chronic CO2 retention in the setting of COPD. Non-gap metabolic
   acidosis most likely due to receiving large amount of IVF over 24 hrs.
   - serial ABGs
   - follow lytes, gap, consider using bicarb for fluids if patient
   remains with severe non gap metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Psych: Holding home Ativan and mirtazipine.
   .
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx, monitor for now

   Additional comments:
   Severe copd likely complicated by NSTEMI, possibly takotsubo's
   Severe acidosis
   now improving on vent
   likely able to wean off vasopressors (in setting of systemic
   vasodilation)
   ultimately will favor cath to evaluate cad and revascularize if

   Assessment and Plan
 74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   required reintubation yesterday.
   # CORONARIES:  Elevated cardiac enzymes continue to trend down,
   suggesting no current ischemia due to new vessel occlusion or demand
   ischemia.  Patient denied chest pain yesterday. Echo final read shows
   nl LV size, extensive regional left and right ventricular systolic
   dysfunction c/w CAD with LVEF 30%.
   - Continue Plavix 75 mg, ASA 325 mg, simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Hold ACEi for now
   - repeat EKG daily
   -Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - PCI before discharge ideal if pt amenable. Appeared not to want
   yesterday; rediscuss w/ pt today.
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic heart failure as reported on final echo read, with
   LVEF 30%. Volume status appears euvolemic-hypovolemic, No evidence of
   overload suggested by absence of crackles or peripheral edema on exam,
   maintaining good end organ perfusion as evidenced by 40-50cc/hr UOP and
   warm extremities.  BP currently stable.
   - cont IVF boluses as needed, as indicated by exam/CXR to avoid
   overload or hypovolemia
 suggest running even to +250 mL today
   - repeat echo today
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, sinus.
   -          Cont to monitor on tele
   -          -Tachy yesterday- continue metoprolol 2.5mg as needed
   .
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has severe COPD with hyperinflation
   on CXR and continued to have respiratory distress; was not able to
   tolerate extubation yesterday.  No evidence of edema, PNA, congestion
   on CXR yesterday. ABG at the time was pH 7.27/54/428 on 100% NRB,
   suggesting Hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
   - Remain intubated in setting of severe COPD w/ failed extubation
   yesterday.
   - Trial of pressure support this afternoon.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs, abx day [**4-25**]); continue IV steroids
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive and tachycardic yesterday
   after extubation and during respiratory distress.
   -Continue IV metoprolol 2.5mg as needed
   .
   # Acid-base disturbance: Patient
s ABG yesterday during respiratory
   distress c/w respiratory acidosis. Now stabilizing with ABG showing no
   acidosis, but continues hypercarbia, likely due to CO2 retention in the
   setting of COPD.
   - serial ABGs
   - follow lytes, gap
   .
   # Psych: Pharmacy showed no Ativan Rx for past 1 yr.
   -If extubated, consider 0.5 Ativan for agitation
   .
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx, monitor for now

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who required reintubation yesterday. The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

- The patient has extensive regional left and right ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%.
- The patient has severe COPD with hyperinflation on chest X-ray and continues to have respiratory distress. He was not able to tolerate extubation yesterday.
- The patient has an elevated cardiac enzyme trend that is decreasing, suggesting no current ischemia due to new vessel occlusion or demand ischemia.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, but it is currently controlled with medication.
- The patient has an abnormal acid-base disturbance with hypercarbia, likely due to CO2 retention in the setting of COPD.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications, including Plavix, ASA, simvastatin, heparin, and metoprolol.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 mmHg to 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
 74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   required reintubation yesterday.
   # CORONARIES:  Elevated cardiac enzymes continue to trend down,
   suggesting no current ischemia due to new vessel occlusion or demand
   ischemia.  Patient denied chest pain yesterday. Echo final read shows
   nl LV size, extensive regional left and right ventricular systolic
   dysfunction c/w CAD with LVEF 30%.
   - Continue Plavix 75 mg, ASA 325 mg, simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Hold ACEi for now
   - repeat EKG daily
   - PCI today ideal if pt amenable. Appeared not to want yesterday;
   rediscuss w/ pt today.
   - if pt refuses PCI, get pulm consult for help extubating
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic heart failure with LVEF 30%. Volume status appears
   euvolemic-hypovolemic, No evidence of overload suggested by absence of
   crackles or peripheral edema on exam, maintaining good end organ
   perfusion as evidenced by 40-50cc/hr UOP and warm extremities.  BP
   currently stable.
   - cont IVF boluses as needed, as indicated by exam/CXR to avoid
   overload or hypovolemia
 goal even today

   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, sinus.
   -          Cont to monitor on tele
   -          -Tachy yesterday- continue metoprolol 2.5mg as needed
   .
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has severe COPD with hyperinflation
   on CXR and continued to have respiratory distress; was not able to
   tolerate extubation yesterday.  No evidence of edema, PNA, congestion
   on CXR yesterday. ABG at the time was pH 7.27/54/428 on 100% NRB,
   suggesting hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
   - Remain intubated in setting of severe COPD w/ failed extubation
   yesterday.
   - Trial of pressure support this afternoon.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs, abx day [**5-25**]); continue PO steroids
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive and tachycardic yesterday
   after extubation and during respiratory distress.
   -Continue IV metoprolol 25mg TID as needed
   .
   # Acid-base disturbance: Patient
s ABG yesterday during respiratory
   distress c/w respiratory acidosis. Now stabilizing with ABG showing no
   acidosis, but continues hypercarbia, likely due to CO2 retention in the
   setting of COPD.
   - serial ABGs
   - follow lytes, gap

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who required reintubation yesterday. The patient has extensive regional left and right ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD), as indicated by an echocardiogram.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's systolic heart failure and extensive ventricular dysfunction, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart attack, or cardiogenic shock.

2. Respiratory complications: The patient's severe COPD and respiratory distress may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or exacerbation of COPD.

3. Infection complications: The patient is at risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.

4. Bleeding complications: The patient is on heparin therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Skin complications: The patient has a developing ulcer below the coccyx, which requires close monitoring to prevent further skin breakdown.

6. Metabolic complications: The patient's acid-base disturbance and hypercarbia indicate a need for careful monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances and blood gases.

7. Psychological complications: The patient's agitation and need for sedation suggest potential psychological complications that require attention.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with respiratory failure, which required intubation, NSTEMI, and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and required intubation. He has severe COPD with hyperinflation on chest X-ray and presenting symptoms consistent with a COPD flare. The patient is still intubated, and there is a plan for trial extubation today.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which is now resolving. The preliminary echocardiogram shows hypokinesis in all areas except for the base, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30-35%. Biomarkers are trending down.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain blood pressure. There is no obvious cause of sepsis, and hypovolemia may be a component of the picture since the COPD flare and decreased oral intake. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and markers of end-organ perfusion is ongoing.

   Assessment and Plan
 74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   required reintubation yesterday.
   # CORONARIES:  Elevated cardiac enzymes continue to trend down,
   suggesting no current ischemia due to new vessel occlusion or demand
   ischemia.  Patient denied chest pain yesterday. Echo final read shows
   nl LV size, extensive regional left and right ventricular systolic
   dysfunction c/w CAD with LVEF 30%.
   - Continue Plavix 75 mg, ASA 325 mg, simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Hold ACEi for now
   - repeat EKG daily
   - PCI today ideal if pt amenable. Appeared not to want yesterday;
   rediscuss w/ pt today.
   - if pt refuses PCI, get pulm consult for help extubating
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic heart failure with LVEF 30%. Volume status appears
   euvolemic-hypovolemic, No evidence of overload suggested by absence of
   crackles or peripheral edema on exam, maintaining good end organ
   perfusion as evidenced by 40-50cc/hr UOP and warm extremities.  BP
   currently stable.
   - cont IVF boluses as needed, as indicated by exam/CXR to avoid
   overload or hypovolemia
 goal even today
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, sinus.
   -          Cont to monitor on tele
   -          -Tachy yesterday- continue metoprolol 2.5mg as needed
   .
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has severe COPD with hyperinflation
   on CXR and continued to have respiratory distress; was not able to
   tolerate extubation yesterday.  No evidence of edema, PNA, congestion
   on CXR yesterday. ABG at the time was pH 7.27/54/428 on 100% NRB,
   suggesting hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
   - Remain intubated in setting of severe COPD w/ failed extubation
   yesterday.
   - Trial of pressure support this afternoon.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs, abx day [**5-25**]); continue PO steroids
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive and tachycardic yesterday
   after extubation and during respiratory distress.
   -Continue IV metoprolol 25mg TID as needed
   .
   # Acid-base disturbance: Patient
s ABG yesterday during respiratory
   distress c/w respiratory acidosis. Now stabilizing with ABG showing no
   acidosis, but continues hypercarbia, likely due to CO2 retention in the
   setting of COPD.
   - serial ABGs
   - follow lytes, gap
   .
   # Psych: Pharmacy showed no Ativan Rx for past 1 yr.
   -If extubated, consider 0.5 Ativan for agitation
   .
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx, monitor for now
   ICU Care

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:

   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Failed attempt at extubation - hypertension., tachycardia , no air
   movement
   have discussed cath with him given concern that ischemia is impeding
   weaning. he is not interested in this option at proesent
   will need to readdress with him later today.
   will also discuss longer term considerations if he is unwilling to
   proceed with cath - ie comfort measures vs trach

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who required reintubation yesterday. The patient has extensive regional left and right ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting no current ischemia due to new vessel occlusion or demand ischemia.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to severe COPD with hyperinflation on chest X-ray and continued respiratory distress. The patient was not able to tolerate extubation yesterday and remains intubated in the setting of severe COPD with failed extubation. A trial of pressure support is planned this afternoon, and ABGs will be followed.

The patient also has hypertension, which is being managed with IV metoprolol as needed. The patient's acid-base disturbance is a result of respiratory acidosis, but it is now stabilizing with no acidosis but continues hypercarbia, likely due to CO2 retention in the setting of COPD.

Psychologically, the patient may require Ativan for agitation if extubated. Additionally, the patient has a possible developing ulcer below the coccyx, which needs to be monitored.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition will be restarted with tube feeding today, and glycemic control will be managed with HISS (hypoglycemia, insulin sensitivity, and stress). Prophylaxis measures include DVT (deep vein thrombosis) prevention with heparin gtt and stress ulcer prophylaxis. VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) bundle will also be implemented.

Overall, the patient's conditions are stable, and appropriate interventions are being implemented to manage his multiple medical complications. Further discussions will be held with the patient regarding long-term considerations if he is unwilling to proceed with a cardiac catheterization."

   Assessment and Plan
 74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   failed extubation 2 days ago; will go to cath lab today.
   # CORONARIES:  Elevated cardiac enzymes continue to trend down,
   suggesting no current ischemia due to new vessel occlusion or demand
   ischemia.  Patient denied chest pain yesterday. Echo final read shows
   nl LV size, extensive regional left and right ventricular systolic
   dysfunction c/w CAD with LVEF 30%.
   - Continue Plavix 75 mg, ASA 325 mg, simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Hold ACEi for now
   - repeat EKG daily
   - PCI today ideal if pt amenable. Appeared not to want yesterday;
   rediscuss w/ pt today.
   - if pt refuses PCI, get pulm consult for help extubating
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic heart failure with LVEF 30%. Volume status appears
   euvolemic-hypovolemic, No evidence of overload suggested by absence of
   crackles or peripheral edema on exam, maintaining good end organ
   perfusion as evidenced by 40-50cc/hr UOP and warm extremities.  BP
   currently stable.
   - cont IVF boluses as needed, as indicated by exam/CXR to avoid
   overload or hypovolemia
 goal even today
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, sinus.
   -          Cont to monitor on tele
   -          -Tachy yesterday- continue metoprolol 2.5mg as needed
   .
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has severe COPD with hyperinflation
   on CXR and continued to have respiratory distress; was not able to
   tolerate extubation yesterday.  No evidence of edema, PNA, congestion
   on CXR yesterday. ABG at the time was pH 7.27/54/428 on 100% NRB,
   suggesting hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
   - Remain intubated in setting of severe COPD w/ failed extubation
   yesterday.
   - Trial of pressure support this afternoon.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs, abx day [**5-25**]); continue PO steroids
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive and tachycardic yesterday
   after extubation and during respiratory distress.
   -Continue IV metoprolol 25mg TID as needed
   .
   # Acid-base disturbance: Patient
s ABG yesterday during respiratory
   distress c/w respiratory acidosis. Now stabilizing with ABG showing no
   acidosis, but continues hypercarbia, likely due to CO2 retention in the
   setting of COPD.
   - serial ABGs

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement in cardiac function.
- The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%. Volume status is euvolemic-hypovolemic, with no evidence of overload on examination.
- The patient's rhythm is characterized by a 1st degree AV block, sinus rhythm, and intermittent tachycardia. There was one episode of bradycardia, likely a vagal response during suctioning.
- The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with severe COPD and ongoing respiratory distress. He failed an extubation trial on [**7-26**], so he will remain intubated.
- The patient's hypertension is intermittent and likely related to agitation.
- The patient's acid-base status is currently stable.
- The patient has a possible developing ulcer below the coccyx, which needs to be monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's systolic heart failure and history of cardiac enzyme elevation, there is a risk of further cardiac deterioration or arrhythmias.

2. Respiratory complications: The patient's severe COPD and ongoing respiratory distress pose a risk of pneumonia, atelectasis, or further deterioration in respiratory function.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. The patient's family has been informed about the situation and has given consent for the patient to undergo a cardiac catheterization procedure. The goal of the procedure is to find a coronary lesion amenable to intervention.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 143/70 mmHg and a heart rate of 96 bpm. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His oxygen saturation is at 95%. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%. His volume status is euvolemic to hypovolemic, and there is no evidence of overload on examination.

The patient's rhythm is currently a first-degree AV block with sinus rhythm, but he has experienced episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia. The patient's respiratory failure is due to severe COPD, and he failed an extubation trial. He remains intubated for now.

The patient's hypertension is intermittent and may be related to agitation. He is being treated with metoprolol and captopril for blood pressure control. His acid-base status is currently stable with a trend towards alkalemia, and he will be monitored closely post-catheterization.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. He has been admitted to the ICU and will be going to the cath lab today for coronary assessment. The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%. His volume status is euvolemic-hypovolemic, with no evidence of overload on exam. He maintains good end-organ perfusion, as evidenced by stable creatinine, urine output, and warm extremities. 

The patient's rhythm is characterized by a first-degree AV block, sinus rhythm, intermittent tachycardia, and one episode of bradycardia, likely a vagal response during suctioning. 

Respiratory failure/COPD: The patient has severe COPD and continues to experience respiratory distress. He failed an extubation trial on [**7-26**]. Therefore, he will remain intubated. 

Hypertension: The patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic, likely related to agitation. 

Acid-base status: The patient's current acid-base status is stable. 

Skin care: There is a possible developing ulcer below the coccyx. 

In terms of medical complications, the patient is at risk for developing further respiratory failure due to his severe COPD and the fact that he failed extubation previously. He is also at risk for cardiac complications due to his"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

- The patient's family was present and the brother gave consent for the cath lab procedure. The patient agreed to the procedure understanding that there is some chance for improvement.
- The patient experienced bradycardia to 46, SBP 60-70, during suctioning, which improved without treatment. This may indicate a vagal response.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- Current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, ranitidine, metoprolol, Plavix, ASA, simvastatin, and heparin.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/70 mmHg to 160/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus tachycardia.
- The patient's weight remains unchanged at 57 kg.
- Fluid balance shows a total input of 998 mL, including 403 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 595 mL through intravenous fluids, and a total output of 1035 mL, including 260 mL through urine.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode.
- Physical examination reveals a thin, intubated, and sedated patient with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, supple neck, distant heart sounds, no rubs/gallops/murmurs, CTAB with poor/moderate air movement, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm extremities with cap refill of 2 seconds.
- Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate levels. Troponin-T levels are decreasing and lactate levels are within normal range.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, and there is no evidence of chest pain.
- Assessment and plan include going to the cath lab today to assess coronaries and find lesions amenable to intervention, continuing Plavix, ASA, and simvastatin, repeating EKG daily, maintaining good end-organ perfusion, and avoiding overload or hypovolemia.
- The patient's rhythm is described as a first-degree AV block with intermittent tachycardia, and there is no evidence of respiratory failure or COPD exacerbation.
- The patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic, likely related to agitation.
- Acid-base status is currently stable with a trend towards alkalemia.
- Skin care is needed for a possible developing ulcer below the coccyx.

   Assessment and Plan
 74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   failed extubation 2 days ago; will go to cath lab today.
   # CORONARIES:  Went to cath lab yesterday to assess coronaries. No
   angiographically apparent disease found in any coronaries; normal
   filling pressures.
   - Will stop Plavix and decrease ASA to 81mg and simvastatin to 20mg
   daily
   - repeat EKG daily
   .
    # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has severe COPD, continues to have
   respiratory distress s/p failed extubation. Likely contributing factors
   include Anxiety and labile BP
s; decreased respiratory drive due to
   acid-base status prior to extubation; auto-PEEP after extubation.
   - Pulmonary consult; need to have goals of care discussion w/ pt
   -Remains intubated in setting of past failed extubation
   - Maintain pH 7.38 range.  Will monitor ventilation to maintain drive
   to breathe.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs); continue PO steroids
   -Continue 0.5 mg boluses of Ativan instead of Versed boluses [**2-22**]
   tendency to go apneic
   # PUMP:  Systolic heart failure with LVEF 30%. Volume status euvolemic-
   hypovolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, BP and HR are labile. Pt
   appears to have non-ischemic cardiomyopathy; possible etiologies
   include post-viral syndrome, result of  chronic HTN/anxiety,
   Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy, no evidence of valvular etiology.
   - goal even today
   -continue aggressive BP management, with Metoprolol, Captopril, Nitro
   drip
   -repeat TTE to reassess
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, SR, intermittent tachycardia; 1 episode
   of bradycardia/sinus pause during episode of coughing/gagging (vagal
   response).
   -  Cont to monitor on tele
   - continue metoprolol 25mg TID.
   .
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic,
   likely related to agitation.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO TID
   - Continue captopril 25mg TID for afterload reduction.
   -Nitro drip to decrease BP, afterload reduction
   # Acid-base status: currently stable w/ pH 7.38.
   - decrease tidal volumes post cath
   - serial ABGs
   - follow lytes, gap
   .
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx,
   -monitor for now
   -turned q 2-3hr, applying skin care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday and no angiographically apparent disease was found in any of the coronary arteries; normal filling pressures were observed. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure/COPD: The patient has severe COPD and continues to have respiratory distress following failed extubation. Factors contributing to this distress include anxiety and labile blood pressure, decreased respiratory drive due to acid-base status prior to extubation, and auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) after extubation. Pulmonary consult is needed for further management.

2. Systolic Heart Failure with LVEF 30%: The patient has systolic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction of 30%. The volume status is euvolemic-hypovolemic, with no evidence of overload on examination. Blood pressure and heart rate are labile. The patient appears to have non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, possibly due to post-viral syndrome, chronic hypertension/anxiety, or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Aggressive blood pressure management, including metoprolol, captopril, and nitro drip, is ongoing.

   # CORONARIES:  Went to cath lab yesterday to assess coronaries. No
   angiographically apparent disease found in any coronaries; normal
   filling pressures.
   - Will stop Plavix and decrease ASA to 81mg and simvastatin to 20mg
   daily
   - repeat EKG daily
   .
    # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has severe COPD, continues to have
   respiratory distress s/p failed extubation. Likely contributing factors
   include Anxiety and labile BP
s; decreased respiratory drive due to
   acid-base status prior to extubation; auto-PEEP after extubation.
   - Pulmonary consult; need to have goals of care discussion w/ pt
   -Remains intubated in setting of past failed extubation
   - Maintain pH 7.38 range.  Will monitor ventilation to maintain drive
   to breathe.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs); continue PO steroids
   -Continue 0.5 mg boluses of Ativan instead of Versed boluses [**2-22**]
   tendency to go apneic
   # PUMP:  Systolic heart failure with LVEF 30%. Volume status euvolemic-
   hypovolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, BP and HR are labile. Pt
   appears to have non-ischemic cardiomyopathy; possible etiologies
   include post-viral syndrome, result of  chronic HTN/anxiety,
   Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy, no evidence of valvular etiology.
   - goal even today
   -continue aggressive BP management, with Metoprolol, Captopril, Nitro
   drip
   -repeat TTE to reassess
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, SR, intermittent tachycardia; 1 episode
   of bradycardia/sinus pause during episode of coughing/gagging (vagal
   response).

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. He underwent a cardiac catheterization yesterday, which showed no angiographically apparent coronary disease and normal filling pressures. The patient's current conditions include severe COPD exacerbation, systolic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. He also has a first-degree AV block, intermittent tachycardia, and a history of hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation and failed extubation put him at risk for continued respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's systolic heart failure and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy increase the risk of further cardiac deterioration, including worsening heart failure symptoms or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: As the patient is intubated and in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other infections due to prolonged immobility and invasive lines.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and invasive lines also increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient's decreased mobility and prolonged periods of pressure on certain body parts, particularly the area below the coc"

   Assessment and Plan
 74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   failed extubation 2 days ago; will go to cath lab today.
   # CORONARIES:  Went to cath lab yesterday to assess coronaries. No
   angiographically apparent disease found in any coronaries; normal
   filling pressures.
   - Continue Plavix 75 mg, ASA 325 mg, simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - repeat EKG daily
   .
    # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has severe COPD, continues to have
   respiratory distress s/p failed extubation. Likely contributing factors
   include Anxiety and labile BP
s; decreased respiratory drive due to
   acid-base status prior to extubation; auto-PEEP after extubation.
   -Remain intubated in setting of past failed extubation
   - Maintain pH 7.38 range.  Will monitor ventilation to maintain drive
   to breathe.
   -Need to have goals of care discussion with brother.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs); continue PO steroids
   -Consider change from Midazolam drip to small 0.5mg boluses of Ativan
   instead
   # PUMP:  Systolic heart failure with LVEF 30%. Volume status euvolemic-
   hypovolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, BP and HR are labile. Pt
   appears to have non-ischemic cardiomyopathy; possible etiologies
   include post-viral syndrome, result of  chronic HTN/anxiety,
   Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy, no evidence of valvular etiology.
   - goal even today
   -continue aggressive BP management, with Metoprolol, Captopril, Nitro
   drip
   -Consider repeat echo to reassess HF
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, SR, intermittent tachycardia; 1 episode
   of bradycardia/sinus pause during episode of coughing/gagging. [**Month (only) 11**] be a
   vagal response
   -          Cont to monitor on tele
   -          continue metoprolol 25mg TID.
   .
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic,
   likely related to agitation.
   - Continue  metoprolol 25mg PO TID
   - Continue captopril 25mg TID for afterload reduction.
   -Nitro drip to decrease BP, afterload reduction
   # Acid-base status: currently stable w/ pH 7.38.
   - decrease tidal volumes post cath
   - serial ABGs
   - follow lytes, gap

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. He has severe COPD and continues to experience respiratory distress. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday, which revealed no angiographically apparent disease in any coronary arteries.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Coronaries: No significant coronary artery disease was found during the cardiac catheterization. The patient should continue taking Plavix 75 mg, ASA 325 mg, and simvastatin 80 mg daily. Repeat EKG daily.

2. Respiratory failure/COPD: The patient remains intubated due to failed extubation. He is experiencing respiratory distress, likely contributed by anxiety, labile blood pressure, decreased respiratory drive due to acid-base status prior to extubation, and auto-PEEP after extubation. Maintain pH in the range of 7.38, monitor ventilation to maintain drive to breathe, follow ABGs, continue nebs for COPD flare, continue PO steroids, and consider changing from Midazolam drip to small boluses of Ativan.

3. PUMP: The patient has systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. He is euvolemic-hypovolemic and does not show signs of fluid overload on examination. Blood pressure and heart rate are labile. The patient appears to have"

- The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed no angiographically apparent coronary disease.
- The patient remains intubated due to failed extubation and continues to have respiratory distress.
- The patient's acid-base status is currently stable with a trend towards alkalemia.
- The patient has a history of severe COPD and is being treated for it.
- The patient has systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%.
- The patient has labile blood pressure and heart rate.
- The patient has been diagnosed with a first-degree AV block and intermittent tachycardia.
- The patient has a possible developing ulcer below the coccyx.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have respiratory distress after failed extubation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure. Intensive monitoring and management are required to maintain adequate respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a central venous catheter and an arterial line, both of which increase the risk of bloodstream infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are necessary.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
 74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   failed extubation 2 days ago; will go to cath lab today.
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient continues to have respiratory
   distress Improved w/ toleration of [**5-25**] pressure support, but failed to
   tolerate SBT of 0/5PS. Likely contributing factors include severe
   pulmonary dx, Anxiety and labile BP
s; decreased respiratory drive due
   to acid-base status
   -reattempt SBT
   -Discuss extubation vs trach placement with pt if fails next SBT
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.39 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe. Discuss with repiratory service.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs); continue PO steroids
   # CORONARIES:  no apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin to 20mg daily
   - repeat EKG daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic- hypovolemic, no evidence of overload
   on exam, BP and HR continue to be labile. EF significantly improved to
   >55%, no longer in systolic HF. Found to have RVH and severe pulmonary
   HTN. No further evidence of cardiomyopathy; possible etiologies include
   post-viral syndrome, result of  chronic HTN/anxiety, Takotsubo
   cardiomyopathy,
   - goal even today
   -continue aggressive BP management, with Metoprolol, Captopril, Nitro
   drip
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, SR, intermittent tachycardia;
   -  Cont to monitor on tele
   . # ANXIETY: Pt has known anxiety disorder, likely contributing to
   difficulty controlling agitation and BP lability. Tolerated 0.5-1.0 IV
   Ativan well, was effective in calming pt.
   .  -Continue 0.5 mg boluses of Ativan instead of Versed boluses [**2-22**]
   tendency to go apneic
   # Hypertension: Patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic,
   likely related to agitation.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO TID and Captopril 12.5mg qHS and 37.5mg
   [**Hospital1 **] for afterload reduction.
   -Nitro drip to decrease BP, afterload reduction
   # Acid-base status: currently stable, trend towards alkalosis w/ pH
   7.41-45.
   -Goal pH 7.36-7.39, pCO2 in 50
s; plan as above to speak w/ respiratory
   service; consider decreasing FiO2 to 25%
   - serial ABGs
   - follow lytes, gap
   .
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx,
   -monitor for now
   -turned q 2-3hr, applying skin care

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. He will be going to the cath lab today. The patient continues to have respiratory distress and has improved with toleration of 5 cmH2O pressure support but failed to tolerate a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with 0/5PS. The likely contributing factors include severe pulmonary disease, anxiety, and labile blood pressure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress indicates a potential risk for continued respiratory failure. It is crucial to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and further complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure may increase the risk of hypotension, especially during procedures or medication administration.
4. Anxiety: The patient has known anxiety disorder, which may contribute to difficulty controlling agitation and blood pressure lability. Proper management of anxiety is essential.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has a possible developing ulcer below the coccyx, indicating the need for regular turning and skin care to prevent further skin breakdown.
6. Acid-base imbalance: The patient's trend towards alkalosis with pH 7.41-45 needs to be closely monitored and managed to maintain the desired pH range.
7. Coronary artery disease: Although"

   distress Improved w/ toleration of [**5-25**] pressure support, but failed to
   tolerate SBT of 5/0 PS- went for 2 hrs but increased respiratory
   distress, decreased TV. Likely contributing factors include severe
   pulmonary dx, Anxiety and labile BP
s, less pCO2 than likely baseline;
   Curently near goal, but breathing on his own.
   -reattempt SBT; if fails, contact pulmonary regarding likelihood of
   success w/ extubation
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Follow ABGs
   -If extubation fails, have goals of care discussion w/ family
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs); continue PO steroids
   # CORONARIES:  no apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin to 20mg daily
   - repeat EKG daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic- hypovolemic, no evidence of overload
   on exam, BP and HR continue to be labile. EF significantly improved to
   >55%, no longer in systolic HF. Found to have RVH and severe pulmonary
   HTN. No further evidence of cardiomyopathy; possible etiologies include
   post-viral syndrome, result of  chronic HTN/anxiety, Takotsubo
   cardiomyopathy,

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. He has severe pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has labile blood pressure and heart rate. His current medications include Plavix, ASA, statin, metoprolol, captopril, nitro drip, ranitidine, and heparin for prophylaxis. He is being closely monitored for any changes in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has failed extubation twice, indicating difficulty in breathing on his own. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and ABGs is necessary to maintain a pH range of 7.36-7.40 and pCO2 in the low 50s to maintain the drive to breathe.

2. Coronary artery disease: Although no apparent coronary artery disease is mentioned at this time, the patient is on low-dose ASA and simvastatin. Regular EKG monitoring should be continued to assess any changes.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. Aggressive blood pressure management with metoprolol, captopril, and nitro drip is essential to prevent cardiogenic shock.

4. Arrhythmias: The patient has intermittent tachycardia and a 1"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure/COPD: The patient continues to have respiratory distress. There are several factors contributing to this, including severe pulmonary disease, anxiety, and labile blood pressure. The patient is near goal but still breathing on his own.

2. Coronaries: No apparent coronary artery disease at this time. The patient is prescribed ASA 81mg and simvastatin 20mg daily, and repeat EKG daily.

3. Pump: The patient's volume status is euvolemic-hypovolemic, with no evidence of overload on exam. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate continue to be labile. The ejection fraction has significantly improved to >55%, indicating no longer in systolic heart failure. The patient is found to have right ventricular hypertrophy and severe pulmonary hypertension. Possible etiologies include post-viral syndrome, chronic hypertension/anxiety, or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

4. Rhythm: The patient has a first-degree AV block, sinus rhythm, and intermittent tachycardia. Continuous monitoring on tele is advised.

   Assessment and Plan
 74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   failed extubation 2 days ago; will go to cath lab today.
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient continues to have respiratory
   distress Improved w/ toleration of [**5-25**] pressure support, but failed to
   tolerate SBT of 5/0 PS- went for 2 hrs but increased respiratory
   distress, decreased TV. Likely contributing factors include severe
   pulmonary dx, Anxiety and labile BP
s, less pCO2 than likely baseline;
   Curently near goal, but breathing on his own.
   - per pulm rec
s, decrease sedation now, control BP, extubate directly
   to biPAP. If re-intubation necessary, discuss trach. And MICU transfer
   - switch nitro to nipride gtt for SBP<140
   - keep IV Ativan at bedside
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs); continue PO steroids
   # CORONARIES:  no apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin to 20mg daily
   - repeat EKG daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic- hypovolemic, no evidence of overload
   on exam, BP and HR continue to be labile. EF significantly improved to
   >55%, no longer in systolic HF. Found to have RVH and severe pulmonary
   HTN. No further evidence of cardiomyopathy; possible etiologies include
   post-viral syndrome, result of  chronic HTN/anxiety, Takotsubo
   cardiomyopathy,
   - goal even today
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, SR, intermittent tachycardia;
   -  Cont to monitor on tele
   . # ANXIETY: Pt has known anxiety disorder, likely contributing to
   difficulty controlling agitation and BP lability. Tolerated 0.5-1.0 IV
   Ativan well, was effective in calming pt.
   .  -Continue 0.5 mg boluses of Ativan instead of Versed boluses [**2-22**]
   tendency to go apneic
   # Hypertension: Patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic,
   likely related to agitation.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO TID and Captopril 12.5mg qHS and 37.5mg
   [**Hospital1 **] for afterload reduction.
   - switch nitro to nipride drip to decrease SBP<140, afterload reduction
      .
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx,
   -monitor for now
   -turned q 2-3hr, applying skin care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. The patient continues to experience respiratory distress and has severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient's left ventricular systolic function has significantly improved, but there are findings of right ventricular hypertrophy and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate remain labile, and there are concerns about anxiety contributing to these symptoms. The patient's medication regimen includes Plavix, ASA, statin, nitroglycerin, and various other medications for sedation, blood pressure control, and respiratory support.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has already experienced respiratory failure, which could worsen if proper respiratory support is not maintained.

2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which may further complicate respiratory function and increase the risk of right ventricular strain or failure.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is often labile, and there is a goal to keep the systolic blood pressure below 140. If the blood pressure drops too low, it could lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs.

4. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of intermittent tachycardia and a first-degree AV block. Monitoring and managing cardiac rhythm is crucial to prevent arrhythmias and their"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   failed extubation 2 days ago; will go to cath lab today.
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient continues to have respiratory
   distress. Failed to tolerate extubation despite strict BP control with
   Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with Ativan. Breathing was labored
   w/ retractions, did not tolerate 2 trials of Bipap.
   Breathing on own for 1 hr, respiratory distress not sustainable. Likely
   etiology is severe Emphysema.
   - Remain intubated at current vent settings.
   -Reattempt to contact IP to discuss trach placement, likely after
   weekend.
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - During the day attempt trials of pressure support.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Begin weaning prednisone to 50mg Qdaily.
   # CORONARIES:  no apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin to 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic- hypovolemic, no evidence of overload
   on exam, no longer in HF.

   . # ANXIETY: Pt has known anxiety disorder, likely contributing
   agitation and BP lability. Tolerated 0.5 IV Ativan well during
   extubation, was effective in calming pt.
   .  -Continue 0.5 mg boluses of Ativan PRN for agitation
   # Hypertension: Patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic,
   likely related to agitation.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO TID.
   - Transition to lisinopril for once a day dosing.
   - Nipride drip DC

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. The patient continues to experience respiratory distress and has been reintubated. The likely etiology of the respiratory distress is severe emphysema. The patient remains intubated at current ventilator settings, with plans to reattempt contact with the interventional pulmonologist (IP) to discuss tracheostomy placement after the weekend. The patient's pH levels are being maintained in the range of 7.36-7.40, and pCO2 is being kept in the low 50s to maintain drive to breathe. Trials of pressure support during the day and nebulizers for COPD flare-ups are being attempted. Prednisone is being weaned down to 50mg daily.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and failure to tolerate extubation indicate a high risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of ventilator settings and oxygenation are necessary.
2. Tracheostomy Complications: Tracheostomy placement carries risks such as bleeding, infection, tracheal stenosis, and damage to structures in the neck. Close monitoring and proper technique during the procedure are crucial to minimize these complications.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Implementing a"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   failed extubation 2 days ago; will go to cath lab today.
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient continues to have respiratory
   distress. Failed to tolerate extubation despite strict BP control with
   Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with Ativan. Breathing was labored
   w/ retractions, did not tolerate 2 trials of Bipap.
   Breathing on own for 1 hr, respiratory distress not sustainable. Likely
   etiology is severe Emphysema.
   - Remain intubated at current vent settings.
   -Reattempt to contact IP to discuss trach placement, likely after
   weekend.
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - During the day attempt trials of pressure support.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Begin weaning prednisone to 50mg Qdaily.
   # CORONARIES:  no apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin to 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic- hypovolemic, no evidence of overload
   on exam, no longer in HF.
   - goal even today
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, SR, intermittent tachycardia;
   -  Cont to monitor on tele
   . # ANXIETY: Pt has known anxiety disorder, likely contributing
   agitation and BP lability. Tolerated 0.5 IV Ativan well during
   extubation, was effective in calming pt.
   .  -Continue 0.5 mg boluses of Ativan PRN for agitation
   # Hypertension: Patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic,
   likely related to agitation.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO TID.
   - Transition to lisinopril for once a day dosing.
   - Nipride drip DC
d after reintubation
      .
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx,
   -monitor for now
   -turned q 2-3hr, applying skin care

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. The patient continues to experience respiratory distress and is likely suffering from severe emphysema. The patient's vital signs include a blood pressure ranging from 110-140s, heart rate ranging from 58-100 bpm, respiratory rate ranging from 11-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of congestion, distant heart sounds, and poor/moderate air movement in the lungs. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes, except for slightly elevated levels of lactate and lactic acid.

The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The plan is to maintain the patient's pH in the range of 7.36-7.40, pCO2 in the low 50s, and continue with current ventilator settings. The healthcare team will also attempt trials of pressure support during the day and follow arterial blood gas (ABG) results. Therapy for COPD flare-ups, including nebulizers, will be continued, and prednisone dosage will be weaned down to 50 mg daily.

   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   failed extubation 2 days ago; will go to cath lab today.
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient continues to have respiratory
   distress. Failed to tolerate extubation despite strict BP control with
   Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with Ativan. Breathing was labored
   w/ retractions, did not tolerate 2 trials of Bipap.
   Breathing on own for 1 hr, respiratory distress not sustainable. Likely
   etiology is severe Emphysema.
   - Remain intubated at current vent settings.
   -Reattempt to contact IP to discuss trach placement, likely after
   weekend.
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs); continue PO steroids
   # CORONARIES:  no apparent dx at this time

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. The patient's respiratory distress continues, and they were unable to tolerate trials of BiPAP. The patient's likely etiology for the respiratory failure is severe emphysema.

The patient remains intubated at current ventilator settings and will likely need a tracheostomy placement after the weekend. The goal is to maintain a pH range of 7.36-7.40, pCO2 in the low 50s, and follow ABGs. COPD flare therapy, including nebs and PO steroids, should be continued.

The patient's volume status is euvolemic-hypovolemic with no evidence of overload on exam. There is no longer evidence of heart failure. The patient has a known anxiety disorder and is likely contributing to agitation and blood pressure lability. Ativan has been effective in calming the patient, so 0.5 mg boluses should be continued as needed for agitation.

The patient's hypertension is intermittent and may be related to agitation. Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, captopril 12.5mg qHS, and [Hospital1] 37.5mg should be continued for afterload reduction. The Nipride drip should be discontinued after reintubation.

There is a possible developing ulcer below the coccyx, so monitoring and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement tomorrow. The patient has severe emphysema and is experiencing respiratory distress. He has been on assist control ventilation with intermittent pressure support and has required reintubation twice due to his inability to tolerate extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and failure to tolerate extubation indicate a high risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Tracheostomy Complications: Tracheostomy carries potential risks such as bleeding, infection, tracheal stenosis, and pneumothorax. These complications should be monitored for after the procedure.
3. PEG Tube Complications: PEG tube placement may be associated with complications such as infection, aspiration pneumonia, perforation of the stomach or intestines, and bleeding.
4. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has systolic heart failure and may be at risk for further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and fluid overload. Monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac enzymes is important.
5. Anxiety and Agitation: The patient has a known anxiety disorder and has shown agitation and blood pressure"

   failed extubation 2 days ago; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**] and planned for
   trach/PEG tomorrow, [**2117-8-2**].
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient continues to have respiratory
   distress. Failed to tolerate extubations X2 despite strict BP control
   with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with Ativan. Pt did not
   tolerate 2 trials of Bipap, would breath on own for 1 hr before
   developing respiratory distress requiring reintubation. Likely etiology
   is severe emphysema. Pt was able to withstand PS most of yesterday with
   plan for trach/peg tomorrow.
   - Remain intubated at current vent settings. Pressure support today
   prior to trach or maintainance on AC.
   - NPO after midnight.
   - Spoke with IP
 they can also place PEG.
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Continue weaning prednisone at 50mg Qdaily.
   # CORONARIES:  no apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin to 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, no
   longer in heart failure.
   - goal even today

   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, SR, intermittent tachycardia;
   -  Cont to monitor on tele
   . # ANXIETY: Pt has known anxiety disorder, likely contributing
   agitation and BP lability. Tolerated 0.5 IV Ativan well during
   extubation, was effective in calming pt.
   .  -Continue 0.5-1.0 mg boluses of Ativan PRN for agitation
   # Hypertension: Patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic,
   likely related to agitation.
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg PO BID.
   - Started lisinopril yesterday for once a day dosing. [**Month (only) 11**] increase
   today for tighter BP management
   - Nipride drip DC

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. He has been intubated and is currently on assisted control ventilation (ACV) with pressure support (PS). The patient is planned for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tomorrow.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 124/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's general appearance is described as thin and intubated, lightly sedated.

On physical examination, the patient's neck is supple with jugular venous pressure (JVP) less than 10 cm, no heart murmurs or rubs/gallops are heard, and there are distant heart sounds. Lung auscultation reveals clear lung fields bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly (HSM) or tenderness. Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Skin examination reveals a pink area beneath the coccyx, but no skin breakdown.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation twice. He is currently intubated and on assisted control ventilation (ACV) with pressure support (PS). The plan is to perform a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tomorrow. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he continues to experience respiratory distress and agitation. His blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's chest X-ray is stable with proper endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube placements. The assessment and plan include continuing respiratory support, managing anxiety, controlling hypertension, monitoring for skin breakdown, and maintaining glycemic control. Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and pressure ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who
   failed extubation 2 days ago; will go to cath lab today.
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient continues to have respiratory
   distress. Failed to tolerate extubation despite strict BP control with
   Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with Ativan. Breathing was labored
   w/ retractions, did not tolerate 2 trials of Bipap.
   Breathing on own for 1 hr, respiratory distress not sustainable. Likely
   etiology is severe Emphysema.
   - Remain intubated at current vent settings.
   -Reattempt to contact IP to discuss trach placement, likely after
   weekend.
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - During the day attempt trials of pressure support.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Begin weaning prednisone to 50mg Qdaily.
   # CORONARIES:  no apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin to 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic- hypovolemic, no evidence of overload
   on exam, no longer in HF.
   - goal even today
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, SR, intermittent tachycardia;
   -  Cont to monitor on tele
   . # ANXIETY: Pt has known anxiety disorder, likely contributing
   agitation and BP lability. Tolerated 0.5 IV Ativan well during
   extubation, was effective in calming pt.
   .  -Continue 0.5 mg boluses of Ativan PRN for agitation
   # Hypertension: Patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic,
   likely related to agitation.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO TID.
   - Transition to lisinopril for once a day dosing.
   - Nipride drip DC
d after reintubation
      .
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx,
   -monitor for now
   -turned q 2-3hr, applying skin care

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who failed extubation two days ago. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to severe emphysema. His volume status is euvolemic-hypovolemic, and there is no evidence of overload on exam. He has a known anxiety disorder and is being treated with Ativan for agitation. The patient's blood pressure is intermittently high, and he is also experiencing tachycardia. He has been started on metoprolol and lisinopril for blood pressure control. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube are planned. The patient's current medications include prednisone, ASA, and simvastatin. His laboratory values are within normal limits. He is receiving tube feeds and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and failure to tolerate extubation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Continued mechanical ventilation and careful monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are necessary.
2. Pneumonia: Intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing pneumonia. The patient should be monitored for signs of infection, and appropriate antibiotics should be initiated if necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**2117-8-2**] 11:41 AM
   Patient with increased work of breathing yesterday and acutely in
   distress yesterday morning with O2 sats decreased to 92%.  This was
   thought to be [**2-22**] VAP and he was started on Vanc/Zosyn for empiric
   coverage.  His FiO2 was increased to 40% and his vent settings were
   switched to AC instead of pressure support.  He was also having
   increased bronchial secretions which have changed in color to
   yellow-brown/tan.
   Yesterday his sputum gram stain showed gram positive cocci in clusters
   with blood and urine cultures still pending.  Per ID, Vanc/Zosyn was
   changed to Vanc/Cefepime for VAP.
   Overnight, his sedation held for low BP (80's/30s).  Lisinopril was
   increased from 10mg to to 20mg yesterday.
   I/Os: was +372 at 22:00 but will hold on active diuresis for now as pt

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has
   failed extubation x2; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**], now with increased work of
   breathing, febrile, and increased secretions concerning for ventilator
   associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture showed GPC in clusters.
   # Presumed Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: Patient febrile with GPC in
   clusters on sputum gram stain.  There is a strong suspicion for
   acquired pneumonia despite chest xray without acute change.  With
   slightly decreased work of breathing since yesterday morning.  Started
   on Vanc/Zosyn yesterday, which was switched to Vanc/Cefepime per ID.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime per ID recs, consider double pseudomonas
   coverage if patient worsens
   - FU Sputum cultures
   - FU Blood and urine cultures
   - Repeat CXR today, FU final read
   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD.   Now he likely has
   VAP and being treated with Vanc/Cefepime.   He was switched to AC
   yesterday with FiO2 of 0.4.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime as above
   - Will discuss TRACH placement after  possible pneumonia stablized, IP
   following, appreciate recs
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Continue prednisone at 50mg Qdaily, if patient decompensates consider
   giving stress dose steroids.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Patient is hypotensive this morning, possibly related to
   new infection on sputum gram stain, possibly related to increased dose
   of lisinopril to 20mg daily yesterday.
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg PO BID.
   - Hold Lisinopril at this time, restart at 10mg daily until infection
   stabilizes and patients blood pressure increases to >100 SBP
   - Nipride drip DC

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice.
- The patient has been experiencing increased work of breathing, fever, and increased secretions, which are concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- A sputum gram stain showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection.
- The patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn empirically for VAP, but the antibiotic regimen was later changed to vancomycin and cefepime per Infectious Disease recommendations.
- The patient's blood pressure has been low, and the dose of lisinopril was increased from 10mg to 20mg yesterday.
- The patient's fluid balance has been positive, with an intake of 2,164 mL and output of 1,000 mL.
- The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

   24 Hour Events:
 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**2117-8-2**] 11:41 AM
   Patient with increased work of breathing yesterday and acutely in
   distress yesterday morning with O2 sats decreased to 92%.  This was
   thought to be [**2-22**] VAP and he was started on Vanc/Zosyn for empiric
   coverage.  His FiO2 was increased to 40% and his vent settings were
   switched to AC instead of pressure support.  He was also having
   increased bronchial secretions which have changed in color to
   yellow-brown/tan.
   Yesterday his sputum gram stain showed gram positive cocci in clusters
   with blood and urine cultures still pending.  Per ID, Vanc/Zosyn was
   changed to Vanc/Cefepime for VAP.
   Overnight, his sedation held for low BP (80's/30s).  Lisinopril was
   increased from 10mg to to 20mg yesterday.  Given a 250ml bolus of NS,
   pressure responded well.

   associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture showed GPC in clusters.
   # Presumed Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: Patient febrile with GPC in
   clusters on sputum gram stain.  There is a strong suspicion for
   acquired pneumonia despite chest xray without acute change.  With
   slightly decreased work of breathing since yesterday morning.  Started
   on Vanc/Zosyn yesterday, which was switched to Vanc/Cefepime per ID.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime per ID recs, consider double pseudomonas
   coverage if patient worsens

   - Repeat CXR today, FU final read
   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD.   Now he likely has
   VAP and being treated with Vanc/Cefepime.   He was switched to AC
   yesterday with FiO2 of 0.4.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime as above
   - Will discuss TRACH placement after  possible pneumonia stablized, IP
   following, appreciate recs
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50

   # HYPOTENSION: Patient is hypotensive this morning, possibly related to
   new infection on sputum gram stain, possibly related to increased dose
   of lisinopril to 20mg daily yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to increased work of breathing, fever, and increased secretions. Sputum gram stain showed gram-positive cocci in clusters. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime empiric coverage for VAP. The patient's blood pressure is low, and there are concerns about hypotension possibly related to a new infection or increased dose of lisinopril. Other issues include COPD flare, anxiety, and potential developing skin ulcer below the coccyx.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's symptoms and sputum gram stain indicate the presence of VAP. Continued treatment with vancomycin and cefepime is recommended, along with monitoring for any worsening of symptoms.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to a new infection or increased dose of lisinopril. Holding lisinopril and restarting at a lower dose once the infection stabilizes is advised.

3. COPD flare: The patient has a history of severe emphysema/COPD. Treatment for COPD flare, including nebulized bronchodilators, should be continued.

   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has
   failed extubation x2; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**], now with increased work of
   breathing, febrile, and increased secretions concerning for ventilator
   associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture showed GPC in clusters.
   # Presumed Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: Patient febrile with GPC in
   clusters on sputum gram stain.  There is a strong suspicion for
   acquired pneumonia despite chest xray without acute change.  With
   slightly decreased work of breathing since yesterday morning.  Started
   on Vanc/Zosyn yesterday, which was switched to Vanc/Cefepime per ID.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime per ID recs, consider double pseudomonas
   coverage if patient worsens
   - FU Sputum cultures
   - FU Blood and urine cultures
   - Repeat CXR today, FU final read
   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD.   Now he likely has
   VAP and being treated with Vanc/Cefepime.   He was switched to AC
   yesterday with FiO2 of 0.4.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime as above
   - Will discuss TRACH placement after  possible pneumonia stablized, IP
   following, appreciate recs
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Continue prednisone at 50mg Qdaily, if patient decompensates consider
   giving stress dose steroids.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Patient is hypotensive this morning, possibly related to
   new infection on sputum gram stain, possibly related to increased dose
   of lisinopril to 20mg daily yesterday.
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg PO BID.
   - Hold Lisinopril at this time, restart at 10mg daily until infection
   stabilizes and patients blood pressure increases to >100 SBP
   - Nipride drip DC
d after reintubation
   # CORONARIES:  no apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, no
   longer in heart failure.
   - goal even today
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, SR, intermittent tachycardia;
   -  Cont to monitor on tele
   . # ANXIETY: Pt needing increased sedation secondary to agitation.
   Pulled arterial line yesterday. Has known anxiety disorder, likely
   contributing agitation and BP lability. Tolerated 0.5 IV Ativan well
   during extubation, was effective in calming pt.
   .  -Continue 0.5-1.0 mg boluses of Ativan PRN for agitation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to increased work of breathing, fever, and increased bronchial secretions. The sputum gram stain showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is consistent with VAP. He was initially treated with vancomycin and Zosyn, but the antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and cefepime per Infectious Disease recommendations.

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, possibly related to the new infection or an increased dose of lisinopril. His fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload. The arterial line was pulled due to distress.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on assist-control ventilation mode with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 405, indicating respiratory acidosis and adequate oxygenation.

The patient's cardiac status is stable with a normal sinus rhythm and no evidence of congestive heart failure. His neurological status is not assessed in the note.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. He has been experiencing increased work of breathing and decreased oxygen saturation, which led to a diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn empiric coverage for VAP, with his FiO2 increased to 40% and vent settings switched to assist control instead of pressure support. He also had increased bronchial secretions that changed in color to yellow-brown/tan.

The patient's sedation held overnight, and his blood pressure was in the 80's/30s. Lisinopril was increased from 10mg to 20mg. The patient's intake/output status was +372 at 22:00, and diuretics were held as the patient was putting out fluids.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He received cefepime and vancomycin on 08/02/2017 at 05:20 PM and 11:30 PM, respectively.

The patient is on various infusions including fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin sodium. Other medications include fibersource HN (full) at 50 mL/hour.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above.

On the flow sheet, the patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F) and a heart rate of 60 bpm. Blood pressure is low in the 70's/30's, and respiratory rate is within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 100% with a FiO2 of 40%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is 58.5 kg, and he is 70 inches tall. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,164 mL and an output of 1,000 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,164 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 400 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 61. ABG results show pH 7.41, PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 405, and Ve of 8 L/min.

Physical examination findings are not available due to the patient being intubated. Neurologic examination is also not assessable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's WBC count has increased over the course of the hospital stay. Hct levels have been relatively stable. Platelet count has remained within normal limits. Renal function tests show slightly elevated creatinine levels. Electrolyte"

   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has
   failed extubation x2; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**], now with increased work of
   breathing, febrile, and increased secretions concerning for ventilator
   associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture showed GPC in clusters.
   # Presumed Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: Patient febrile with GPC in
   clusters on sputum gram stain.  There is a strong suspicion for
   acquired pneumonia despite chest xray without acute change.  With
   slightly decreased work of breathing since yesterday morning.  Started
   on Vanc/Zosyn yesterday, which was switched to Vanc/Cefepime per ID.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime per ID recs, consider double pseudomonas
   coverage if patient worsens
   - FU Sputum cultures, sensitivities
   - FU Blood and urine cultures
   - Repeat CXR today, FU final read
   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD.   Now he likely has
   VAP and being treated with Vanc/Cefepime.   He was switched to AC
   yesterday with FiO2 of 0.4. Changed to pressure support ([**10-25**], 40%, Tv
   = 500, RR 12) this AM secondary to increased auto peep (10) overnight.
   - Follow up how patient is tolerating preasure support throughout the
   day.
   - Check ABG on pressure support today
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime as above
   - Will discuss TRACH placement after  possible pneumonia stablized, IP
   following, appreciate recs
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Continue prednisone at 50mg Qdaily, if patient decompensates consider
   giving stress dose steroids.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Patient is hypotensive this morning, possibly related to
   new infection on sputum gram stain, possibly related to increased dose
   of lisinopril to 20mg daily yesterday.
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg PO BID.
   - Hold Lisinopril at this time, restart at 10mg daily until infection
   stabilizes and patients blood pressure increases to >100 SBP
   - Nipride drip DC
d after reintubation
   .
   #Hyperglycemia: With elevated blood sugars on finger sticks.
   - Increase HISS to cover for sugars
   - fu blood sugars tomorrow.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  no apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, no
   longer in heart failure.

   . # ANXIETY: Pt needing increased sedation secondary to agitation.
   Pulled arterial line yesterday. Has known anxiety disorder, likely
   contributing agitation and BP lability. Tolerated 0.5 IV Ativan well
   during extubation, was effective in calming pt.
   .  -Continue 0.5-1.0 mg boluses of Ativan PRN for agitation

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**2117-8-2**] 11:41 AM
   Patient with increased work of breathing yesterday and acutely in
   distress yesterday morning with O2 sats decreased to 92%.  This was
   thought to be [**2-22**] VAP and he was started on Vanc/Zosyn for empiric
   coverage.  His FiO2 was increased to 40% and his vent settings were
   switched to AC instead of pressure support.  He was also having
   increased bronchial secretions which have changed in color to
   yellow-brown/tan.
   Yesterday his sputum gram stain showed gram positive cocci in clusters
   with blood and urine cultures still pending.  Per ID, Vanc/Zosyn was
   changed to Vanc/Cefepime for VAP.
   Overnight, his sedation held for low BP (80's/30s).  Lisinopril was
   increased from 10mg to to 20mg yesterday.  Given a 250ml bolus of NS,
   pressure responded well.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed two extubations. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to increased work of breathing, fever, and increased bronchial secretions. Sputum gram stain showed gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient was initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn, but the antibiotics were switched to vancomycin and cefepime per ID recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's symptoms and sputum gram stain results suggest an infection. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any worsening respiratory status.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which could be related to a new infection or increased dose of lisinopril. It is necessary to hold lisinopril and restart at a lower dose once the infection stabilizes.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood sugars, indicating hyperglycemia. It is important to increase insulin therapy and monitor blood glucose levels regularly.
4. Anxiety: The patient has a known anxiety disorder and is experiencing agitation, which may contribute to blood pressure lability. Continued use of Ativan for sedation and anxiety management is recommended.
5. Developing skin ulcer: The patient has a possible developing ulcer below the coc"

   failed extubation x2; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**], now with increased work of
   breathing, febrile, and increased secretions concerning for ventilator
   associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture showed GPC in clusters.
   # Presumed Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: Afebrile since ([**8-2**]) with
   Coagulase positive Staph Aureus in sputum on Vanc/Cefepime (Day #3) for
   VAP. Leukocytosis continues to trend upward. Increased work of
   breathing yesterday evening, improved when changed to AC from PS.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime per ID recs, consider double pseudomonas
   coverage if patient worsens
   - ID approval for antibiotics, must change in POE
   - FU Sputum cultures, sensitivities
   - FU Blood cultures
   - FU final chest Xray read from today.
   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD.   Now he likely has
   VAP and being treated with Vanc/Cefepime.   Tolerated PS yesterday
   until the early evening when patient appeared uncomfortable, switched
   to AC were he appeared more comfortable. Appears comfortable this AM
   with AC (400, 14, 5, 40%) this AM. Auto Peep <5 this AM. ABG on
   pressure support yesterday (7.43/58/139/33/12)
   - Change patient to pressure support today, FU to see how patient
   tolerates
   - Check ABG on pressure support today
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime (Day #3) as above
   - Abx approval of Vanc today by ID
   - TRACH/PEG with IP most likely tomorrow, will evaluate patient today;
   NPO midnight before procedure.
   - FU IP recommendations
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Continue prednisone at 50mg Qdaily, if patient decompensates consider
   giving stress dose steroids.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has increased work of breathing, febrile, and increased secretions, which are concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sputum culture showed coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus in clusters. The patient has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime since day #3 for VAP.

The patient has a history of COPD and severe emphysema, which may be contributing to his respiratory failure. He has been on pressure support ventilation but had increased respiratory distress in the early evening, so he was switched to assist-control ventilation, which he tolerated better.

The patient also experienced episodes of hypotension yesterday, which were responsive to fluid boluses. His blood pressure is currently stable. The patient's fingerstick glucose levels were elevated at 150-200, so his Lantus dose was increased to 4U from 2U.

Other assessments and plans include:
- Continue Vanc/Cefepime per ID recommendations, consider double pseudomonas coverage if the patient worsens.
- ID approval for antibiotics, must change in POE.
- Follow up (FU) sputum cultures and sensitivities.
- FU blood cultures.
- FU final chest X-ray read from today.
- Change patient to pressure support today, FU to see how the patient"

   - FU Blood cultures
   - FU final chest Xray read from today.
   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD.   Now he likely has
   VAP and being treated with Vanc/Cefepime.   Tolerated PS yesterday
   until the early evening when patient appeared uncomfortable, switched
   to AC were he appeared more comfortable. Appears comfortable this AM
   with AC (400, 14, 5, 40%) this AM. Auto Peep <5 this AM. ABG on
   pressure support yesterday (7.43/58/139/33/12)

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7264**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support mode. The patient is also being treated for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and cefepime. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 132/60 to 136/62 mmHg, heart rate between 83 and 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's temperature has been afebrile since [**8-2**], indicating that the fever has resolved. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with white blood cell counts ranging from 10.5 to 20.1 K/uL. The platelet count is within normal limits, ranging from 151 to 198 K/uL. The blood glucose levels are elevated, ranging from 106 to 173 mg/dL, so the Lantus dose has been increased to 4U from 2U. 

The patient's chest X-ray shows clusters of gram-positive cocci (GPC), confirming the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, which is consistent with the suspected diagnosis of VAP. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing vancomycin and cefepime for VAP,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient is febrile, has increased work of breathing, and increased secretions, which are concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sputum culture showed Gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting Staphylococcus aureus infection. Antibiotics have been started, and the patient will continue to receive vancomycin and cefepime.

The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has failed extubations due to severe emphysema/COPD. He was switched to assisted control ventilation with a FiO2 of 0.4 and is now on pressure support ventilation with a TV of 500, RR 12, and PS of 40%. The patient's ABG will be checked on pressure support today.

The patient is hypotensive, possibly related to a new infection or increased dose of lisinopril. The lisinopril will be restarted at 10mg daily once the infection stabilizes and the patient's blood pressure increases to >100 SBP. Metoprolol will continue at 50mg PO BID.

The patient's blood sugars have been elevated on finger sticks, indicating hyperglycemia. The HISS will be increased to cover for sugars, and"

   - FU final CXR today
   - PICC today
   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD, and second extubation
   may have been complicated by developing VAP.   Now being treated with
   Vanc/Cefepime.   Tolerated PS briefly yesterday, switched to AC where
   he appeared more comfortable. Appears comfortable this AM with AC (400,
   14, 5, 40%) this AM. Auto-PEEP <5 this am.  ABG on pressure support
   yesterday (7.42/57/158/38/10).
   - TRACH/PEG with IP tomorrow; NPO midnight before procedure
   - Change patient to pressure support today, FU to see how patient
   tolerates
   - Check ABG on pressure support today
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime (Day #[**4-28**]) as above
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Prednisone tapered to 40mg daily, will continue to taper slowly
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Patient is normotensive this morning with blood pressure
   stabilizing over last 24 hours.  No need for fluid bolus yesterday.
   Good urine output.
   - Give 250cc fluid bolus as needed for hypotensive episodes, goal MAP >
   55-60
   - Continue Metropolol to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to hold Lisinopril until SBP stabilizes >100, without
   episodes of hypotension.   Will consider adding this back if patient
   becomes hypertensive as he has been in the past
   .
   #Hyperglycemia: Fingersticks show blood sugar is more controlled at
   117-169. Lantus increased to 4U from 2U two days ago, appears to be
   controlling sugars well.
   - Continue to follow fingersticks and will adjust accordingly

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice.
- He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has a history of COPD and is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and cefepime.
- He is scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tomorrow.
- The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he no longer requires intravenous fluids.
- His glucose levels are being controlled with insulin.
- The patient's leukocytosis is resolving, indicating improvement in his condition.
- The sputum culture has grown coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus.
- The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.42, indicating a normal acid-base balance.
- He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PS) and tolerating it well.
- The patient's lung mechanics are improving, with a decrease in auto-PEEP.
- The CXR from yesterday showed faint opacities in the left lower lobe, which have improved compared to the previous day. There is still a faint opacity slightly more superior in the left lower lobe.
- The patient has been on Vanc/Cefepime for VAP since [**4-28**] and is expected to continue this antibiotic regimen.

   24 Hour Events:
   - IP saw patient yesterday, plan Trach/PEG for Friday, [**2117-8-6**] in OR.
   Time TBD.
   - PICC pending
   - Patient switched to PS briefly yesterday.  ABG after switch to PS
   showed baseline pCO2.  Tolerated this initially but became agitated,
   requiring Ativan and increase in Versed, so switched back to AC.
   -F/U blood cx (Pending)
   -CXR: A faint left lower lobe opacity has improved compared to [**2117-8-2**].
   A faint opacity slightly more superior in the left lower lobe persists.
   It is unclear whether these opacities represent bronchopneumonia or
   atelectasis. No focal areas of definite consolidation are evident.
   Persistent severe flattening of the hemidiaphragms consistent with
   emphysema is stable.
   - No hypotension overnight so not requiring IVF bolus

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has increased work of breathing, febrile, and increased secretions, which are concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His sputum culture has grown coag + Staph aureus. He is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime, antibiotics recommended by the ID team, for VAP. The patient also has severe emphysema/COPD, and there is a plan to perform a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tomorrow. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has signs and symptoms of VAP, including increased work of breathing, febrile, and increased secretions. The presence of coag + Staph aureus in his sputum culture further supports this diagnosis. He is already receiving appropriate antibiotics for VAP, but close monitoring and follow-up with sputum cultures and ABGs are necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable in the past, requiring fluid boluses. However, he is currently normotensive. It is important to continue monitoring his blood pressure and providing fluid boluses as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >"

The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on vancomycin and cefepime. The patient is planned for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tomorrow. His sputum culture has grown coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, and appropriate antibiotics have been initiated. It is important to continue monitoring for any worsening of symptoms or changes in sputum culture.
2. Tracheostomy and PEG procedure: The patient is planned for a tracheostomy and PEG tomorrow. These procedures carry potential risks such as bleeding, infection, or damage to surrounding structures. Close monitoring and adherence to proper surgical protocols are essential.

   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD, and second extubation
   may have been complicated by developing VAP.   Now being treated with
   Vanc/Cefepime.   Tolerated PS briefly yesterday, switched to AC where
   he appeared more comfortable. Appears comfortable this AM with AC (400,
   14, 5, 40%) this AM. Auto-PEEP <5 this am.  ABG on pressure support
   yesterday (7.42/57/158/38/10).
   - TRACH/PEG with IP tomorrow; NPO midnight before procedure

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has a clean cath on [**2117-7-29**] and is now with resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia. The sputum culture has grown coag+ Staph aureus. Trach/PEG is planned for tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, as evidenced by the presence of coagulase-positive Staph aureus in the sputum culture. This is a common complication in patients who have been mechanically ventilated for an extended period of time.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, requiring IV fluid bolus administration. It is important to monitor and manage blood pressure to maintain adequate organ perfusion.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. Close monitoring and adjustment of insulin therapy are necessary to maintain glycemic control.

4. Anxiety and agitation: The patient has experienced episodes of anxiety and agitation, which have required additional sedation and anxiolytic medication. It is important to continue monitoring for these symptoms and providing appropriate management.

5. Skin breakdown: There is a possibility of developing pressure ulcers, especially given the patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest. Regular skin assessment and repositioning are essential"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with nafcillin and cefepime. He is also scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today. 

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 85/53 mmHg to 100-130/70-90 mmHg. His heart rate has been stable, ranging from 67-100 beats per minute. His respiratory rate is set at 14 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is consistently above 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.0 x 10^9/L, decreased hematocrit levels (from 33.5% to 26.6%), and decreased platelet count (from 156 x 10^9/L to 104 x 10^9/L). His blood glucose levels have been well-controlled, ranging from 104-156 mg/dL. 

The patient's chest X-ray shows massive overinflation and loss of parenchymal structure, consistent with pulmonary emphysema. There is also a minimal linear atelectasis at the left lung base"

   the left lung base. Otherwise, unchanged.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has
   failed extubation x2; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**], now with resolving
   ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture has grown coag+ Staph
   aureus.  Trach/PEG planned for today.   PICC placed yesterday for
   antibiotics and sedation.
   # Presumed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: He has been afebrile since
   [**8-2**] with MSSA on sputum culture.  On Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day #[**5-28**]) for
   VAP. Leukocytosis has resolved today (WBC 8.8 today from 10.3 yesterday
   and 20.1 the day before).
   - Continue Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day [**5-28**]), consider double pseudomonas
   coverage if patient worsens.
   - Continue to follow Blood cultures
   - FU today
s CXR
   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD, and second extubation
   may have been complicated by developing VAP.   Now being treated with
   Nafcillin/Cefepime.   Kept on AC yesterday where he appeared more
   comfortable. Appears comfortable this AM with AC (400, 14, 5, 40%) this
   AM. Auto-PEEP <5 this am
   - TRACH/PEG with IP today; Has been npo since midnight
   - Will keep patient on AC ventilation today for procedure
   - Check VBG on AC today
   - Continue Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day #[**5-28**]) as above
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Prednisone tapered to 40mg daily, will continue to taper slowly
   - Trach collar trials today
   - speech/swallow eval tomorrow ([**8-6**])
   .
   # ANEMIA: Patient with low Hct this am (26.6) and has been trending
   down over last 3-4 days.  Some of it may be dilution as patient has
   been self-diuresing and has been given NS over the last 3-4 days, and
   WBC and platelets have been trending down as well. Guaic negative
   - Type and screen this am in preparation for procedure
   - Hemolysis labs
   - Transfuse if Hct < 21
   - Hold labs next AM to save blood as they have been normal
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Patient slightly hypotensive overnight and given fluid
   bolus.  Overall negative 1.2L yesterday with substantial urine output.
   - Give 250cc fluid bolus as needed for hypotensive episodes, goal MAP >
   55-60
   - Held Metropolol last night, but will continue with 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] dosing
   if pressures stabilize
   - Continue to hold Lisinopril until SBP stabilizes >100, without
   episodes of hypotension.
   - Monitor UOP as sign for fluid boluses
   .
   #HYPERGLYCEMIA: Fingersticks show blood sugar is more controlled at
   104-156. Lantus increased to 4U from 2U three days ago, appears to be
   controlling sugars well.  Given half-dose of lantus last night b/c NPO
   for procedure.
   - Continue to follow fingersticks and will adjust accordingly
   - Decrease amount of fingersticks as FSBS
s have been low
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, no
   longer in heart failure.  I/O
s negative yesterday and goal was to be
   even.
   - goal even today and patient will likely be given IVF during procedure

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7264**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Trach/PEG today.  Revisit the issue of whether his metabolic alkalosis
   is out of proportion to what one would expect for compensation for his
   elevated PCO2.  Patient care 30 minutes.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been treated with nafcillin and cefepime. The patient is planned for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today. 

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, ranging from 100-130 systolic and 70-90 diastolic. He has also had episodes of hypotension overnight and was given a fluid bolus. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been trending down, currently at 26.6%, and he has been self-diuresing some of the fluid given over the last few days. 

The patient's glucose levels have been well-controlled with Lantus, an insulin medication. His fingersticks show blood sugar levels between 104-156. 

The patient's cardiac status is stable, but there is a borderline first-degree AV block on the ECG. 

The patient's skin care is a concern due to possible developing ulcers and hematoma around the penis and scrotum. 

Overall, the patient's plan includes continuing nafcillin and cefepime, type and screen for the procedure, hemolysis labs, and close monitoring of blood pressure, hematocrit, and glucose levels."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), for which he is receiving nafcillin and cefepime. He is planned for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today. The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis that has resolved today, with a WBC count of 8.8. He also has anemia with a low hematocrit level of 26.6. The patient experienced hypotension overnight and was given a fluid bolus. His blood glucose levels are well-controlled with Lantus insulin. There are no apparent coronary artery disease findings at this time. The patient's volume status is euvolemic, and his I/O balance is negative. He is being monitored for anxiety, agitation, and potential skin breakdown. The patient's recent medications include nafcillin, cefepime, heparin, lansoprazole, senna, colace, and metoprolol. He is currently on a fibrous HN tube feed at 40 mL/hour but has been NPO since midnight."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has
   failed extubation x2; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**], now with resolving
   ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture has grown coag+ Staph
   aureus.  Trach/PEG placed yesterday.
   # Presumed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: He has been afebrile since
   [**8-2**] with MSSA on sputum culture.  On Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day #[**5-28**]) for
   VAP. Leukocytosis has resolved today (WBC 8.8 today from 10.3 yesterday
   and 20.1 the day before).
   - Continue Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day [**6-28**]), consider double pseudomonas
   coverage if patient worsens.
   - Continue to follow Blood cultures
   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD, and second extubation
   may have been complicated by developing VAP.   Now being treated with
   Nafcillin/Cefepime.   Kept on AC where he appeared more comfortable.
   Appears comfortable this AM with AC (400, 14, 5, 40%) this AM.
   Auto-PEEP <5 this am
   - TRACH/PEG done
   - Will keep patient on AC ventilation today for procedure
   - Continue Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day #[**5-28**]) as above
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Prednisone tapered to 40mg daily, will continue to taper slowly
   - Trach collar trials today
   - speech/swallow eval tomorrow ([**8-6**])
   .
   # ANEMIA: Patient with low Hct 30, which has come up slightly from
   previous day (26.6).  Some of it may be dilution as patient has been
   self-diuresing and has been given NS over the last 3-4 days, and WBC
   and platelets have been trending down as well. Based on iron studies,
   likely secondary to iron deficiency anemia. Guaic negative
   - Type and screen done
   - Transfuse if Hct < 21
   - Hold labs this AM to save blood as they have been normal
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Patient slightly hypotensive overnight and given fluid
   bolus.  Overall negative 1.2L yesterday with substantial urine output.
   - Give 250cc fluid bolus as needed for hypotensive episodes, goal MAP >
   55-60
   - Held Metropolol last night, but will continue with 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] dosing
   if pressures stabilize
   - Continue to hold Lisinopril until SBP stabilizes >100, without
   episodes of hypotension.
   - Monitor UOP as sign for fluid boluses
   .
   #HYPERGLYCEMIA: Fingersticks show blood sugar is more controlled at
   104-156. Lantus increased to 4U from 2U three days ago, appears to be
   controlling sugars well.  Given half-dose of lantus last night b/c NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on nafcillin and cefepime for treatment. The patient's tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were done yesterday. He has been afebrile since August 2nd, with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) grown on sputum culture. His leukocytosis has resolved today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP and is being treated with nafcillin and cefepime. Close monitoring for any signs of worsening or antibiotic resistance is necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient has low hemoglobin levels, indicating iron deficiency anemia. Blood transfusion should be considered if the hemoglobin level falls below 21.
3. Hypotension: The patient is slightly hypotensive, and fluid boluses will be given as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55-60. Medications such as metoprolol and lisinopril may need to be adjusted accordingly.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are controlled with Lantus insulin. Fingerstick blood glucose monitoring will continue to adjust the insulin"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has
   failed extubation x2; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**], now with resolving
   ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture has grown coag+ Staph
   aureus.  Trach/PEG placed yesterday.
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations
   X2 despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management
   with Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD, and second
   extubation may have been complicated by developing VAP.   Now being
   treated with Nafcillin/Cefepime.   Kept on AC where he appeared more
   comfortable. Appears comfortable this AM with AC (450, 14, 5, 40%) this
   AM.
   - TRACH/PEG done
   - Will keep patient on AC ventilation now, will put on trach collar
   today per RT
   - Try to wean sedation
   - Will ask pulmonary to follow-up
   - Continue Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day #[**6-28**]) as above
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Prednisone tapered to 40mg daily, will continue to taper slowly
   - Speech/swallow eval today ([**8-7**])
   # Presumed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: He has been afebrile since
   [**8-2**] with MSSA on sputum culture.  On Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day #[**6-28**]) for
   VAP. Leukocytosis has resolved today (WBC 8.8 today from 10.3 yesterday
   and 20.1 the day before).
   - Continue Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day [**6-28**]), consider double pseudomonas
   coverage if patient worsens.
   - Continue to follow Blood cultures
   .
   # ANEMIA: Patient with low Hct 30, which has come up slightly from
   previous day (26.6).  Some of it may be dilution as patient has been
   self-diuresing and has been given NS over the last 3-4 days, and WBC
   and platelets have been trending down as well. Based on iron studies,
   likely secondary to iron deficiency anemia. Guaic negative
   - Type and screen done
   - Transfuse if Hct < 21
   - Held labs this AM to save blood as they have been normal
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt. with 1 episode of low BP 96/44 about 2 hours after
   12.5 mg metoprolol given; one 250 cc fluid bolus given
stable since
   then
   - Give 250cc fluid bolus as needed for hypotensive episodes, goal MAP >
   55-60
   - Hold Metropolol for low pressures, but will continue with 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing if pressures stabilize
   - Monitor UOP as sign for fluid boluses
   - Will wean Versed as could be contributing
   .
   #HYPERGLYCEMIA: Fingersticks show blood sugar is more controlled at
   104-156.
   - D/c
d ISS; will check q AM sugars (this AM 129) stable
   - Continue daily finger sticks and monitor insulin needs based on this.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, no
   longer in heart failure.  I/O
s negative today and goal was to be even.
   - goal even today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Borderline 1st degree AV block on today
s ECG, SR;
   -  Cont to monitor on telemetry
   . # ANXIETY: Versed decreased to 3mg/hr, Fentanyl increased to
   75mcg/hr.  Has known anxiety disorder, likely contributing agitation
   and BP lability.
    -Continue 0.5-1.0 mg boluses of Ativan PRN for agitation
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx, and now with
   substantial hematoma around penis and scrotum
   - Monitor for now, have elevated scrotum to encourage drainage
   - Turned q 2-3hr, applying skin care

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to severe emphysema/COPD and suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 109/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/COPD: The patient has failed to tolerate extubations twice, indicating severe respiratory compromise likely due to emphysema/COPD. He is currently being treated with antibiotics for suspected VAP.
2. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit (Hct) level of 30, which suggests iron deficiency anemia. Further evaluation and management are recommended.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of low blood pressure (96/44 mmHg), which responded to a fluid bolus. Close monitoring and further treatment are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been elevated, but are now more controlled. Insulin therapy will continue to be adjusted based on fingerstick blood glucose"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has a history of resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on nafcillin and cefepime. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 109/55 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on assisted ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Presumed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: Continue nafcillin/cefepime, consider double pseudomonas coverage if the patient worsens.
2. Respiratory failure/COPD: The patient has failed to tolerate extubations twice despite strict blood pressure control and anxiety management. He appears comfortable on assisted ventilation with AC (400, 14, 5, 40%) today.
3. Trach/PEG: Done.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has severe emphysema/COPD and is being treated with Nafcillin and Cefepime for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed. His current vital signs are stable, and he is comfortable on assist-control ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient has resolved leukocytosis and has been afebrile since August 2nd. His hemoglobin levels are low, indicating possible iron deficiency anemia. He has also shown signs of hypotension, hyperglycemia, and anxiety. The patient's skin care is being monitored due to possible developing ulcers and hematoma around the penis and scrotum.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, for which he is taking aspirin and simvastatin. He is also on insulin for glycemic control and heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Plan:

1. Continue Nafcillin and Cefepime for suspected VAP.
2. Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has
   failed extubation x2; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**], now with resolving
   ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture has grown coag+ Staph
   aureus.  Trach/PEG placed yesterday.
   # Presumed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: He has been afebrile since
   [**8-2**] with MSSA on sputum culture.  On Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day #[**5-28**]) for
   VAP. Leukocytosis has resolved today (WBC 8.8 today from 10.3 yesterday
   and 20.1 the day before).
   - Continue Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day [**6-28**]), consider double pseudomonas
   coverage if patient worsens.
   - Continue to follow Blood cultures
   Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations X2
   despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management with
   Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD, and second extubation
   may have been complicated by developing VAP.   Now being treated with
   Nafcillin/Cefepime.   Kept on AC where he appeared more comfortable.
   Appears comfortable this AM with AC (400, 14, 5, 40%) this AM.
   Auto-PEEP <5 this am
   - TRACH/PEG done
   - Will keep patient on AC ventilation today for procedure
   - Continue Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day #[**5-28**]) as above
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Prednisone tapered to 40mg daily, will continue to taper slowly
   - Trach collar trials today
   - speech/swallow eval tomorrow ([**8-6**])
   .
   # ANEMIA: Patient with low Hct 30, which has come up slightly from
   previous day (26.6).  Some of it may be dilution as patient has been
   self-diuresing and has been given NS over the last 3-4 days, and WBC
   and platelets have been trending down as well. Based on iron studies,
   likely secondary to iron deficiency anemia. Guaic negative
   - Type and screen done
   - Transfuse if Hct < 21
   - Hold labs this AM to save blood as they have been normal
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt. with 1 episode of low BP 96/44 about 2 hours after
   12.5 mg metoprolol given; one 250 cc fluid bolus given
stable since
   then
   - Give 250cc fluid bolus as needed for hypotensive episodes, goal MAP >
   55-60
   - Hold Metropolol for low pressures, but will continue with 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing if pressures stabilize
   - Continue to hold Lisinopril until SBP stabilizes >100, without
   episodes of hypotension.
   - Monitor UOP as sign for fluid boluses
   .
   #HYPERGLYCEMIA: Fingersticks show blood sugar is more controlled at
   104-156.
   - D/c
d ISS; will check q AM sugars (this AM 129) stable
   - Continue daily finger sticks and monitor insulin needs based on this.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, no
   longer in heart failure.  I/O
s negative today and goal was to be even.
   - goal even today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Borderline 1st degree AV block on today
s ECG, SR;
   -  Cont to monitor on telemetry
   . # ANXIETY: Versed decreased to 3mg/hr, Fentanyl increased to
   75mcg/hr.  Has known anxiety disorder, likely contributing agitation
   and BP lability.
    -Continue 0.5-1.0 mg boluses of Ativan PRN for agitation
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx, and now with
   substantial hematoma around penis and scrotum
   - Monitor for now, have elevated scrotum to encourage drainage
   - Turned q 2-3hr, applying skin care

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been on nafcillin/cefepime for VAP treatment. The patient also has severe emphysema/COPD and is being treated with nebs. He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement yesterday. The patient's hemoglobin level is low, likely due to iron deficiency anemia. He has episodes of hypotension and is being closely monitored for fluid balance. His blood sugar levels are being managed with fingersticks and insulin as needed. The patient's anxiety and agitation are being treated with versed and ativan. There are concerns about potential skin breakdown in the coccyx area and a hematoma around the penis and scrotum. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, heparin, lansoprazole, senna, colace, and glargine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed VAP and is being treated with nafcillin/cefepime. Close monitoring and adherence to the VAP bundle are important to prevent further complications.
2. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest iron deficiency anemia. Appropriate management with iron supplementation is necessary to address this condition.

   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has
   failed extubation x2; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**], now with resolving
   ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture has grown coag+ Staph
   aureus.  Trach/PEG placed Friday.
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations
   X2 despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management
   with Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD, and second
   extubation may have been complicated by developing VAP.   Now being
   treated with Nafcillin/Cefepime. This morning comfortable on ps.
   - Will attempt [**2-23**] trials on PS today with ABG
   - Fentanyl gtt held. Will bolus PRN and convert to PO meds.
   - Will ask pulmonary to follow-up
   - Continue Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day #[**7-28**]) as above
   - Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Prednisone tapered to 40mg daily, will continue to taper slowly
   - FU Speech/swallow eval likely tomorrow
   # Presumed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: MSSA on sputum culture.  On
   Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day #[**7-28**]) for VAP. Leukocytosis has resolved. Low
   grade temperatures yesterday and this AM.
   - Continue Nafcillin/Cefepime (Day [**7-28**]), consider double pseudomonas
   coverage if patient worsens.
   - Continue to follow Blood cultures
   - UA/Urine Cx.
   .
   # Nausea: new onset of nausea before tube feeds starting; and since TFs
   started has had low residuals; unlikely secondary to tube
   feeding
uncertain etiology at this point.
     - Continue Zofran PRN and Ativan is zofran does not help enough
     - Continue to monitor
   # ANEMIA: Patient with HCT of 22.3 today.. Based on iron studies,
   likely secondary to iron deficiency anemia. Guaic negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be
   secondary to procedure on Friday?
   - Type and screen done
   - Transfuse if Hct < 21
   - Will fu HCT this AM. Continue to guaiac stools. Transfuse based on
   criteria above.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Stable in last 24 hours.
   - Give 250cc fluid bolus as needed for hypotensive episodes, goal MAP >
   55-60
   - D/C metoprolol since pressures have been low enough
   - Monitor UOP as sign for fluid boluses
   - Versed weaned and now off.
   .
   #HYPERGLYCEMIA: Fingersticks show blood sugar is more controlled at
   104-156.
   - D/c
d ISS; will check q AM sugars (this AM 141) stable
   - Continue qam finger sticks, restart fingersticks if AM sugars
   elevated.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, no
   longer in heart failure.  I/O
s negative today and goal was to be even.
   - goal even today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Borderline 1st degree AV block on today
s ECG, SR;
   -  Cont to monitor on telemetry
   . # ANXIETY: Fentanyl gtt stopped will bolus fentanyl as needed.
    -Continue 0.5-1.0 mg boluses of Ativan PRN for agitation
   # Skin care: possible developing ulcer below coccyx, and now with
   substantial hematoma around penis and scrotum
   - Monitor for now, have elevated scrotum to encourage drainage
   - Turned q 2-3hr, applying skin care

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. The patient has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) with nafcillin and cefepime. His respiratory failure is likely due to severe emphysema/COPD and possibly complicated by developing VAP. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and he is comfortable on pressure support ventilation (PSV). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/COPD: The patient's severe emphysema/COPD could lead to further respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed VAP, which needs to be continuously monitored and treated to prevent worsening.
3. Nausea: The patient has experienced new onset nausea, which could be related to tube feeds or an uncertain etiology.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit (HCT) level, indicating possible iron deficiency anemia. Further evaluation and management are required.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable at the moment, but there is a concern for potential hypotension episodes that may require fluid"

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome/Intraabdominal Hypertension (ACS/IAH): This condition occurs when there is increased pressure within the abdominal cavity, which can lead to compromised blood flow and organ dysfunction. Complications may include organ damage, renal failure, and respiratory distress.
2. Nausea/Vomiting: These symptoms can be caused by several factors, including medication side effects, gastrointestinal issues, or neurological problems. Complications may include dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and aspiration pneumonia.
3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's ability to receive proper nutrition may be compromised due to gastrointestinal issues or the use of tube feeds. Complications may include malnutrition, weight loss, and impaired wound healing.
4. Anxiety: Anxiety can have various causes, such as the patient's medical condition or the stress of being in the ICU. Complications may include increased sympathetic activity, tachycardia, hypertension, and impaired sleep.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and his leukocytosis has resolved. He is also being managed for presumed COPD flare, with nebulized treatments and prednisone. The patient's blood sugar levels are more controlled, and he has stable vital signs with no evidence of heart failure or overload. However, he is experiencing some skin issues, including a developing ulcer below the coccyx and a substantial hematoma around the penis and scrotum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown signs of improvement since starting treatment for VAP with nafcillin and cefepime. It is important to continue monitoring his response to the antibiotics and consider double pseudomonas coverage if the patient worsens.
2. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is 22.3, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment for the anemia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains stable, but there is a plan to give fluid boluses as needed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is being treated with nafcillin and cefepime. His recent lab results show leukocytosis but it has resolved, low-grade temperatures, and anemia with a hematocrit of 22.3. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is tolerating tube feeds well. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/COPD: The patient's history of severe emphysema/COPD and failure to tolerate extubation suggests a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of his respiratory status is crucial.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's current diagnosis of VAP increases the risk of worsening lung infection and respiratory distress. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and adherence to VAP bundle protocols should be continued.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit level indicates anemia. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address the underlying cause and improve oxygen-carrying capacity.
4. Nausea and potential aspiration: The new onset of nausea and low residuals after starting tube feeds suggest a possibility of gastrointestinal intolerance. Monitoring for signs of aspiration and adjusting the feeding regimen may be required.
5. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension and the need for fluid boluses indicate a risk of inadequate blood pressure control. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are essential.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood sugar levels require careful monitoring and management to prevent complications associated with hyperglycemia.
7. Skin breakdown: The developing ulcer below the coccyx and substantial hematoma around the penis and scrotum indicate a risk of skin breakdown. Proper skin care and repositioning are necessary to prevent further complications.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable with ongoing management of his respiratory status, antibiotics for VAP, and monitoring of vital signs. However, close attention to potential complications such as anemia, nausea, hypotension, hyperglycemia, and skin breakdown is crucial to prevent further deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently being treated with Nafcillin and Cefepime. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99.7°F, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 103/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving tube feeds through a PEG tube and is being weaned off fentanyl gtt, with plans to convert to oral medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/COPD: The patient has severe emphysema/COPD, which may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, as indicated by the growth of coag+ Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum culture. Continued treatment with appropriate antibiotics is essential to prevent further complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is 22.3%, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, and transfusion may be required if the HCT falls below 21%.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has a tracheostomy and PEG tube in place. The patient's current concerns include respiratory failure/COPD, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia, anemia, nausea, hypotension, hyperglycemia, and anxiety. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 91/50 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 37.8°C.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and has failed extubation twice. This indicates a high risk for recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed presumed VAP, as indicated by the growth of coag+ Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum culture. This increases the risk of worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is low at 21.5%, indicating anemia. This may contribute to fatigue and weakness.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, which may indicate hypotension. This could lead to inadequate perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Hyperglycemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has a tracheostomy and PEG tube in place. He is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by coag+ Staphylococcus aureus with nafcillin and cefepime. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is comfortable on pressure support ventilation (PSV). He will attempt trials on PSV today with arterial blood gas (ABG) monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and has failed extubation twice. He may continue to experience respiratory distress and may require ongoing ventilatory support.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients. He is currently being treated with antibiotics, but there is a risk of worsening infection or resistance to the current antibiotic regimen.
3. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit (HCT) level of 21.5, indicating anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is suspected, but further evaluation is needed to confirm the cause and determine appropriate treatment.
4. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which may be related to his heart failure or sepsis. Close monitoring and fluid management will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice.
- He has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed on Friday.
- The patient's current condition shows improvement as he is comfortable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and his vital signs are stable.
- His hemoglobin (Hct) level has decreased to 21.5%, indicating anemia, likely secondary to iron deficiency.
- The patient has a confirmed case of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He is being treated with nafcillin and cefepime.
- Other issues include nausea, hypotension, hyperglycemia, anxiety, and potential skin breakdown.
- The patient's current plan is to continue with non-invasive ventilation and work towards long-term weaning off the ventilator.
- The patient is DNR/do not reintubate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and failure to tolerate extubation twice puts him at risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient already has a confirmed case of VAP, which requires ongoing treatment and poses a risk for worsening respiratory status.
3. Anemia: The patient's low"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has
   failed extubation x2; clean cath on [**2117-7-29**], now with resolving
   ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Sputum culture has grown coag+ Staph
   aureus.  Trach/PEG placed Friday.
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has failed to tolerate extubations
   X2 despite strict BP control with Nipride gtt and Anxiety management
   with Ativan. Likely etiology is severe emphysema/COPD, and second
   extubation may have been complicated by developing VAPFinished Abx
   regimen with good improvement. 2 episodes of respiratory distress
   yesterday; 1 during transfusion, 1 during movement while bathing. 1^st
   episode may have been [**2-22**] bronchospasm reaction to transfusion vs
   anxiety vs increased movement. Pt feels increased movement exacerbates
   breathing, indicating fragility of respiratory tolerance to
   perturbation. This morning comfortable on ps.
   - Will attempt  trials w/ higher PEEP of 8
   - Nafcillin/Cefepime dc
d last night
   - Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Maintain pH 7.36-7.40 range, pCO2 in low 50
s to maintain drive to
   breathe.
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs).
   - Prednisone taper at 30mg daily, will continue to taper slowly
   # ANEMIA: Patient with HCT of 25.8 today, indicating appropriate
   response to transfusion. Low reticulocyte count yesterday (1.6)
   inappropriate given degree of anemia. Based on iron studies, likely
   secondary to iron deficiency anemia. Guaiac negative. Slowly trended
   down during hospitalization, likely iatrogenic +/- steroid inhibition.
   -Monitor for now
   # Presumed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: MSSA on sputum culture.
   Nafcillin/Cefepime finished last night (Day #[**8-28**]) for VAP. Leukocytosis
   has resolved. Low grade temperatures continue
   - Blood and Urine cultures were negative
   -Continue to monitor improvement
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Stable in last 24 hours.
   - Give 250cc fluid bolus as needed for hypotensive episodes, goal MAP >
   55-60
   - Monitor UOP as sign for fluid boluses
   - Versed weaned and now off.
   .
   #HYPERGLYCEMIA: blood sugars Controlled on 4U glargine and HISS.
   - Continue Insulin sliding scale with Lantus 4U daily.
   - QACHS finger sticks.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No apparent dx at this time
   - ASA 81mg and simvastatin 20mg daily
   # PUMP:  Volume status euvolemic, no evidence of overload on exam, no
   longer in heart failure.  I/O
s even today and goal was to be even.
   - goal even today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus Rhythm.
   -  Cont to monitor on telemetry
   . # ANXIETY: 2 episodes of anxiety relieved with Ativan.
    -Continue 0.5-1.0 mg boluses of Ativan PRN for agitation
   # Skin care: skin breakdown below coccyx, L elbow and now with
   substantial hematoma around penis and scrotum
   - Monitor for now, have elevated scrotum to encourage drainage
   - Turned q 2-3hr, applying skin care

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. The patient is being treated for respiratory failure/COPD, anemia, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypotension, hyperglycemia, and anxiety. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 115/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains fragile, as evidenced by previous episodes of respiratory distress during extubation attempts and during a blood transfusion. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilation support may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, as indicated by the growth of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum culture. Appropriate antibiotic therapy has been initiated, but close monitoring for clinical improvement and potential recurrence is essential.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 7.1 g/dL, indicating anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the anemia,"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has been placed on a clean cath on [**2117-7-29**] and now has resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sputum culture has grown coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. He also has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed on Friday.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure/COPD, anemia, presumed VAP, hypotension, hyperglycemia, coronary artery disease, pump failure, sinus rhythm, and anxiety. He has had two episodes of respiratory distress, one during a transfusion and one during movement while bathing. The first episode may have been a bronchospasm reaction to transfusion versus anxiety versus increased movement. The patient feels that increased movement exacerbates breathing, indicating fragility of respiratory tolerance to perturbation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 115/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm. His weight is currently 60.2 kg, with a height of 70 inches. His fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,148 mL, with 463 mL of blood products given. His output is 1,100 mL, with 220 mL of urine output. He is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O. His arterial blood gas (ABG) values are 7.41/53/355 with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 118.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8.8 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.1 g/dL, platelet count of 161 x 10^9/L, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 81 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 145 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level of 3.6 mEq/L, and albumin level of 3.5 g/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin appearance with a tracheostomy in place, able to answer questions and write on a clipboard. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no wheezes or crackles. His abdomen is soft and non-distended, with bowel sounds present. There is no evidence of peripheral edema or jugular venous distention.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with systolic heart failure and respiratory failure who has failed extubation twice. He has been placed on a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's main issues include respiratory failure/COPD, anemia, presumed VAP, hypotension, hyperglycemia, coronary artery disease, pump failure, rhythm disturbances, anxiety, and skin breakdown. The patient's condition has improved with the administration of antibiotics and supportive care. The plan is to continue with high PEEP ventilation, monitor for any further complications, and eventually wean off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure/COPD may lead to further deterioration if not properly managed.
2. Anemia: The patient has a low reticulocyte count and a declining hemoglobin level, indicating iron deficiency anemia. It is important to monitor the patient's response to iron supplementation or transfusions.
3. Presumed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown improvement since the completion of antibiotic therapy for VAP. However, close monitoring for any signs of recurrent infection or worsening lung function is necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains stable but needs to be monitored closely, especially during fluid administration or changes in medication.
5. Hyperglyc"
