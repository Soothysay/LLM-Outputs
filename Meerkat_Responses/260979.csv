   HPI:
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary
   to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease c/b encephalopathy and varices (never
   bled in the past), COPD, and type 2 diabetes who presented on [**11-10**]
   with AMS presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, now admitted to the
   MICU with upper GI bleeding. This evening she had a bloody stool
   followed by hematemesis of 2 cupfuls of blood. She remained
   hemodynamically stable (BP 100s, HR 80s). An NG tube was placed and
   lavage revealed blood and clot that did not clear after 300 cc's. HCT
   returned at 29.6 (from 33.6). She was transferred to the ICU for urgent
   endoscopy.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, she endorsed some lightheadedness, but denied CP
   or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV was placed and the
   first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was consented for EGD, but as the
   procedure was beginning, she vomited a very large amount of BRB and
   clot. BP dropped to 80s/40s. 2 more units were rapidly transfused and
   she was urgently intubated for airway protection. Peripheral
   phenylephrine was also briefly started. After a total of 5 units of
   pRBCs were tranfused, BP had improved to 150s, so phenylephrine easily
   turned off. Repeat endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the
   esophagus and filling the stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices
   due to amount of blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1048**] tube
   was placed. IR and anesthesia were then consulted for urgent TIPS.
   .
   Of note, her hospital course has been significant for a 5L paracentesis
   performed [**11-12**] (negative for SBP), and [**11-25**] positive blood cultures
   from [**11-13**] (presumed contaminant), and possible PNA for which she was
   intially started on broad spectrum antibiotics, more recently tapered
   down to just levofloxacin.

","Summary:
Mrs. [**Known lastname**], a 72-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease, presented with altered mental status presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy. She was admitted to the MICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Her current condition is unstable due to the bleeding, but her hemodynamic status has improved after receiving blood transfusions. She is intubated for airway protection, and urgent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleeding: Mrs. [**Known lastname**] has a history of cirrhosis and varices, which can lead to variceal bleeding. The bleeding has been significant, and she required multiple units of blood transfusion to stabilize her condition.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: As a result of her liver disease, Mrs. [**Known lastname**] is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which is causing her altered mental status.
3. Respiratory failure: Due to the large volume of blood loss, Mrs. [**Known lastname**] has developed respiratory failure and is currently intubated for airway protection.
4. Infection: Mrs. [**Known lastname**] has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. She"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, encephalopathy, and varices. She presented with altered mental status and was admitted to the MICU with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has a positive blood culture from 11/13/20XX (presumed contaminant), possible pneumonia (PNA), and a positive blood culture from 11/25/20XX. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and later tapered down to levofloxacin. Her current medications include ceftriaxone, pantoprazole, and flagyl.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis, renal failure, COPD, diabetes type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, osteoporosis, and a recent episode of GI bleeding. She is currently intubated for airway protection due to a large upper GI bleed and is on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to the large upper GI bleed. Continuous monitoring and weaning off the ventilator once her condition stabilizes will be crucial.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy - The patient has a history of hepatic encephal"

   HPI:
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary
   to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease c/b encephalopathy and varices (never
   bled in the past), COPD, and type 2 diabetes who presented on [**11-10**]
   with AMS presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, now admitted to the
   MICU with upper GI bleeding. This evening she had a bloody stool
   followed by hematemesis of 2 cupfuls of blood. She remained
   hemodynamically stable (BP 100s, HR 80s). An NG tube was placed and
   lavage revealed blood and clot that did not clear after 300 cc's. HCT
   returned at 29.6 (from 33.6). She was transferred to the ICU for urgent
   endoscopy.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, she endorsed some lightheadedness, but denied CP
   or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV was placed and the
   first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was consented for EGD, but as the
   procedure was beginning, she vomited a very large amount of BRB and
   clot. BP dropped to 80s/40s. 2 more units were rapidly transfused and
   she was urgently intubated for airway protection. Peripheral
   phenylephrine was also briefly started. After a total of 5 units of
   pRBCs were tranfused, BP had improved to 150s, so phenylephrine easily
   turned off. Repeat endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the
   esophagus and filling the stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices
   due to amount of blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1048**] tube
   was placed. IR and anesthesia were then consulted for urgent TIPS.
   .
   Of note, her hospital course has been significant for a 5L paracentesis
   performed [**11-12**] (negative for SBP), and [**11-25**] positive blood cultures
   from [**11-13**] (presumed contaminant), and possible PNA for which she was
   intially started on broad spectrum antibiotics, more recently tapered
   down to just levofloxacin.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 72-year-old woman with alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency leading to cirrhosis and varices.
- She presented with altered mental status, presumed to be hepatic encephalopathy.
- She has a history of COPD, type 2 diabetes, and possible PNA.
- She was admitted to the MICU for upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.
- She experienced a significant drop in blood pressure during an endoscopy procedure.
- She required urgent intubation for airway protection.
- Her current condition includes respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and potential renal failure.
- She also has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, osteoporosis, and possible diabetes.
- The patient's blood cultures showed coagulation-negative Staphylococcus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated due to large upper GI bleeding and requires careful monitoring and management to ensure adequate gas exchange.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be exacerbated by factors such as infections or gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of mental status and management with lactulose is necessary.
3. Renal failure: The patient's admission creatinine level was elevated, and she is at risk for developing renal dysfunction due to hypovolemia, hypotension, and potential contrast exposure during TIPS placement.
4. Infection: The patient's blood cultures revealed coagulation-negative Staphylococcus, indicating a possible infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further investigation into the source of infection should be pursued.
5. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing risk for recurrent bleeding from varices or other sources. Aggressive management with octreotide and pantoprazole is recommended.
6. Hepatic hydrothorax: The patient has small pleural effusions, which could potentially develop into hepatic hydrothorax due to the underlying liver disease.
7. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's cirrhosis and renal dysfunction put her at risk for hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure associated with advanced liver disease.

   HPI:
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary
   to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease c/b encephalopathy and varices (never
   bled in the past), COPD, and type 2 diabetes who presented on [**11-10**]
   with AMS presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, now admitted to the
   MICU with upper GI bleeding. This evening she had a bloody stool
   followed by hematemesis of 2 cupfuls of blood. She remained
   hemodynamically stable (BP 100s, HR 80s). An NG tube was placed and
   lavage revealed blood and clot that did not clear after 300 cc's. HCT
   returned at 29.6 (from 33.6). She was transferred to the ICU for urgent
   endoscopy.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, she endorsed some lightheadedness, but denied CP
   or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV was placed and the
   first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was consented for EGD, but as the
   procedure was beginning, she vomited a very large amount of BRB and
   clot. BP dropped to 80s/40s. 2 more units were rapidly transfused and
   she was urgently intubated for airway protection. Peripheral
   phenylephrine was also briefly started. After a total of 5 units of
   pRBCs were tranfused, BP had improved to 150s, so phenylephrine easily
   turned off. Repeat endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the
   esophagus and filling the stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices
   due to amount of blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1048**] tube
   was placed. IR and anesthesia were then consulted for urgent TIPS.
   .
   Of note, her hospital course has been significant for a 5L paracentesis
   performed [**11-12**] (negative for SBP), and [**11-25**] positive blood cultures
   from [**11-13**] (presumed contaminant), and possible PNA for which she was
   intially started on broad spectrum antibiotics, more recently tapered
   down to just levofloxacin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, varices, COPD, and type 2 diabetes. She was admitted to the MICU with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and altered mental status. She had a bloody stool followed by hematemesis and an NG tube was placed, revealing blood and clot that did not clear after lavage. Her hematocrit dropped from 33.6 to 29.6, and she received 5 units of packed red blood cells. An endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the esophagus, and the procedure was aborted. An IABP was placed, and she was urgently intubated for airway protection. Her blood pressure improved after transfusion, and the phenylephrine was turned off. Repeat endoscopy was not able to visualize or treat the varices due to the amount of blood. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt 400 mL, RR 20, PS 5 cmH2O, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 40%, and RSBI 18. Her current vital signs are as follows: T 36.8°C, HR 87 bpm, BP 103/52 mmHg, RR 9 insp/min, SpO2 96%, and CVP 17 mmHg. The patient's lab results show a WBC count of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, who presented to the MICU with massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from esophageal varices and subsequently underwent an emergent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient's hematocrit levels have stabilized, and there have been no further bleeding episodes. Octreotide infusion has been discontinued.

The patient has been successfully extubated and is able to take medications crushed in apple sauce and lactulose orally. An abdominal ultrasound (US) has been performed, but the results are pending. A speech and swallow evaluation is required in the morning.

The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), adhesive tape (topical), and levofloxacin. The last doses of antibiotics administered were levofloxacin, metronidazole, and ceftriaxone.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
- Heart rate: 92 bpm (84-92)
- Blood pressure: 90/49 mmHg (64-127/63-87)
- Respiratory rate: 10 breaths per minute (9-25)
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on nasal cannula

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, who presented with encephalopathy and esophageal varices. He was admitted to the MICU for massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding and underwent an emergent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient's hematocrit is stable, and there is no further bleeding. Octreotide infusion has been stopped, and the patient successfully extubated. He is able to take medications in a crushed form with apple sauce and lactulose orally at 8 pm. An abdominal ultrasound is pending, and the patient needs a speech and swallow evaluation in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and current symptoms of encephalopathy indicate a risk for hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Esophageal varices: The patient has a history of esophageal varices, which are enlarged veins in the esophagus. These varices have a high risk of bleeding, and the patient has already experienced a massive upper gastrointestinal bleed. There is a possibility of recurrent bleeding or further complications related to the varices.
3. Infection: As the patient has been admitted to the ICU and received various invasive procedures and treatments,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and A1AT deficiency, who was transferred to the MICU for massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and subsequently underwent an emergent Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient's hematocrit levels have stabilized, and there has been no further bleeding. Octreotide infusion was stopped, and the patient successfully extubated after discontinuing sedation. The patient is now able to take medications crushed in apple sauce and is receiving lactulose orally.

The patient's abdominal ultrasound (US) results are pending, and a speech and swallow evaluation is needed. The patient has allergies to sulfa, adhesive tape, and topical antibiotics. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Levofloxacin, Metronidazole, and Ceftriaxone.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/49 to 127/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 69.8 kg, with a height of 62 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 661 mL and output of 120 mL via"
