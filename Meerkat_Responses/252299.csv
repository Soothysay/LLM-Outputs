   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION and Sepsis
   Suspect septic shock secondary to ESBL E coli which was recently
   isolated from her urine. Should be sensitive to the meropenem which she
   is currently receiving. Hemodynamic stability improving, pressor
   requirement decreasing. WBC with large increase today and bandemia. Was
   leukopenic yesterday
 could have been due to infection, but also
   possibly due to antibiotics she had received prior to her lithotripsy.
   Given ureteral stenting procedure consider also RP bleed
 but
   hematocrit stable. Received large volume of IVF resuscitation yesterday
   with increased O2 requirement correspondingly. Perfusing adequately
   good urine output, mentating.
   --Continue meropenem, reculture if febrile. Given surgical procedure,
   could add vancomycin if she decompensates
   --If abdominal pain worsens consider CT abdomen r/o bleed post-surgery,
   follow Hct
   --Will try to minimize additional fluid boluses today as possible, wean
   pressors as tolerated. Goal MAP >65. Will tolerated higher CVP (15-20)
   given history of pulmonary hypertension on prior [**Year (4 digits) **]
 NEPHROLITHIASIS (KIDNEY STONES)
   Follow up with GU. Toradol and acetaminophen for pain as needed today.
   Follow up GU recommendations.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a recent ESBL E. coli urinary tract infection and who underwent lithotripsy. The patient experienced hypotension post-procedure and required aggressive fluid resuscitation, as well as the use of vasopressors. She is currently on levophed and vasopressin, which are being tapered off. The patient complains of persistent right-sided abdominal and back discomfort.

The patient has no known drug allergies, and her last dose of antibiotics was meropenem on January 23rd at 5:35 AM. She is currently receiving meropenem 500mg IV every six hours. Her vital signs include a temperature of 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 86/66 to 70/31 mmHg, heart rate between 70-81 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is paced, central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg, and maximum airway pressure (MAP) is 65 mmHg.

The patient has received a total of 7,861 mL of intravenous fluids since midnight, with 4,061 mL of normal saline and 1,330 mL of lactated Ringer's solution. She has had a total output of 500 mL of blood products and 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient underwent lithotripsy, a procedure that resulted in the presence of ESBL-producing bacteria in their urine. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for this infection and requires support with levophed and vasopressin due to ongoing hypotension. The patient has been adequately fluid resuscitated but may require minimalization of fluids due to underlying MR (most likely referring to mitral regurgitation). The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), which may require further intervention from urology. The patient also has chronic anemia that needs to be evaluated as an outpatient. In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition and glycemic control through regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and peripheral lines. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous UF heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is critical."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with septic shock due to an infection related to lithotripsy. They have been receiving antibiotics for an ESBL infection found in their urine prior to the procedure. The patient requires continuous vasopressor and inotropic support, which is being gradually tapered. They have been adequately fluid resuscitated, taking into consideration their underlying MR (most likely referring to mitral regurgitation). The patient is still experiencing hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Organ dysfunction or failure due to ongoing sepsis.
2. Recurrent kidney stone formation if the current stones are not addressed properly.
3. Development of further infections due to the presence of ESBL-producing bacteria.
4. Complications related to long-term use of vasopressors and inotropes.
5. Possible acute blood loss leading to anemia, although there is currently no evidence for this.
6. Poor glycemic control due to the use of regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic management.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note. Additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

He is currently weaned off levophed and remains on vasopressin per protocol, with stable mean arterial pressures (MAPs). The patient has been switched to morphine for pain control, which has been effective. His pain level is currently 1-3. The patient has no known drug allergies and received his last dose of antibiotics (meropenem) on 01/24/2126 at 05:30 AM. He is currently on vasopressin infusion at 2.4 units per hour. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) given at 08:00 AM on 01/23/2126. Other medications include meropenem 500mg IV every 6 hours on day 3, hydrocortisone 100mg IV every 8 hours, and protonix. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for mild right-sided abdominal discomfort.

Flowsheet data as of 01/24/2126 at 07:35 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius (98.2 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/66 to 124/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient's history, physical examination, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted changes. The patient has been receiving antibiotics and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still below baseline, although improving. There is a concern for ongoing hypotension despite weaning off pressors.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient was initially diagnosed with sepsis, but cultures have been negative to date. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of worsening sepsis.
3. Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones): The patient has been diagnosed with kidney stones. Awaiting urology input for future procedure.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
5. Pulmonary edema: There is uncertainty regarding the cause of pulmonary edema, with potential contributions from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and congestive heart failure (CHF). Cardiology review of echos and suggestions for long-term management are needed.
6. Heart block: The patient is experiencing a heart block.
7. Glycemic control: The patient requires regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
8. Lines: The patient has multiple lines, including multi-lumen, 18 gauge, 20 gauge"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented with hypotension following lithotripsy and is suspected to have urosepsis. She was initially requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure but is now stable. The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis and was on meropenem antibiotics. She also has new-onset atrial fibrillation and an irregular pulse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's presentation with hypotension and suspected urosepsis indicates an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not managed properly.
2. Atrial fibrillation/arrhythmia: The patient's new onset of atrial fibrillation and irregular pulse need to be monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Volume overload: The patient is currently experiencing volume overload, as evidenced by the presence of crackles at the bilateral bases of the lungs on physical examination. This condition requires careful management to avoid further complications like pulmonary edema.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension and requirement for pressors suggest possible adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation and management are necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
5. Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones): The patient has a history of kidney stones, and it is unclear whether the stones have completely passed. Monitoring urine output and following up with urology will be important in managing"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of nephrolithiasis who presented to the ICU in septic shock post lithotripsy. She was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation (AFib) and a pacemaker that was firing on the T waves, which was changed to DDI. The patient was advised to start amiodarone and metoprolol, and consideration was given to ASA.

The patient has had episodes of labile blood pressure with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 80s, but remains asymptomatic. She continues to have brief episodes of AFib overnight. Good urine output has been maintained, but diuresis to goal has not been achieved due to hypotension.

A transthoracic echo (TTE) was performed, showing an ejection fraction (EF) of >55%, with mild mitral regurgitation (MR) and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The right ventricular (RV) chamber size may be slightly smaller compared to the prior study, and the degree of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary hypertension detected are slightly less.

Microbiology results show an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli sensitive to meropenem. Blood cultures were negative. Other lab results indicate elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly decreased hematocrit (Hct), platelet count"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with hypotension, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 106/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but they are experiencing fatigue, palpitations, and cough. 

The patient has undergone several tests including an EKG, trans-thoracic echo, blood cultured, arterial line insertion, and removal. The results of these tests are not mentioned in the provided information. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal troponin-T level. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the left base of the lungs, normal cardiovascular sounds, and absent pulses in both right and left dorsal pedis (DP) pulses. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed due to a language barrier.

The patient's current treatment includes infusion of metoprolol and meropenem antibiotics. The patient is also receiving nutrition and has prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing septic shock from a urinary source. She underwent lithotripsy and was diagnosed with urosepsis, atrial fibrillation, which was converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone. The patient is currently off pressors, indicating improvement in her hypotension. She is also showing improvement in her sepsis. The patient has a history of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) and her atrial fibrillation is well-controlled with amiodarone and lopressor. She has some lung collapse on the chest X-ray, contributing to her shortness of breath, for which incentive spirometry is being used. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, which is likely due to sepsis, but is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock from a urinary source, indicating a severe infection that can lead to organ failure if not managed properly.
2. Kidney Stones: The patient has a history of kidney stones, which can cause complications such as recurrent urinary tract infections and further kidney damage if not addressed.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be closely monitored, as it can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure if not well-controlled.
4. Lung Collapse: The presence of lung collapse"

   CT Torso:
   1. Findings consistent with right-sided pyelonephritis with ureteral
   stent in place.  Small stone fragments in the collecting system and
   distal right ureter.
   2.  Large bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, anasarca.
   3.  Hypodense hepatic and renal lesions (in addition to findings of
   pyelonephritis), too small to characterize.

   Assessment and Plan
   63F who presented with hypotension s/p lithotripsy, on meropenem for
   urosepsis, initally requiring pressors, developed A-fib, controlled
   with amiodarone and metoprolol, no arrythmia overnight.
   1.  Urosepsis:  Day 5 of meropenem.   Patient mentating clearly,
   continues to have good urine output. WBC trending down today. Cultures
   negative/pending since E. coli isolate
   -PICC line today for long-term antibiotics, will pull central line once
   PICC is placed
   -culture central line tip after removal, follow up cultures and
   reculture if febrile
   -continue with current goals of MAP > 65, CVP 8-12 and monitor urine
   output, bolus as necessary
   2.  Fluid overload: Decreased oxygen requirements though still volume
   overloaded in setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation for septic
   shock. Continue diuresis goal negative 1-2 L as Bp tolerates.
   3.  A-fib, pacer:  Continue metoprolol and amiodarone, aspirin for ppx.
   Will follow up with cardiology and device clinic.
   5.  Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets 180 at admission, 107 today. Likely
   [**1-26**] sepsis. Had similar drop with prior septic episode.  No clinical
   signs/sx of thrombosis. Follow.
   6.  Adrenal Insufficency: s/p Stress dose steroids, now off
   7.  Renal Caliculi:  per urology, they will not know if stones have
   passed for several months
   -follow urine output, morphine prn pain

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female who presented with hypotension following lithotripsy and is suspected to have urosepsis. The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone several interventions.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Urosepsis: The patient is currently on day 5 of meropenem, which is an antibiotic treatment for urosepsis. The patient's WBC count is trending down, indicating a positive response to treatment. However, there is a risk of ongoing infection, so it is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or development of new symptoms.

2. Fluid overload: The patient is still volume overloaded despite aggressive fluid resuscitation for septic shock. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure. The plan is to continue diuresis and aim for negative fluid balance.

3. Atrial fibrillation (A-fib): The patient developed A-fib, which has been controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and follow up with cardiology for further management.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped from 180 at admission to 107 today. This is likely due to sepsis, similar to a previous episode. Close monitoring of the platelet count is necessary, and no"
