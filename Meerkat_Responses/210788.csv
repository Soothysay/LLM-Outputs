   65M w/ CML s/p allo-SCT
 multiple recent admission for respiratory
   infections. Over the past 5 days or so has been experiencing worsening
   dyspnea. Today became more SOB at home following episode of diarrhea.
   VNA measured pulse ox in 70's and sent him to ER. In ER 7.31/68/118 on
   unclear amount of O2.
   He was intubated and a CXR showed LLL opacity, unclear if infiltrate
   versus effusion. He required CVL placement and was placed on levophed.
   He received IVF and broad antibiotics. His pressors have been weaned
   and his hemodynamics have stabilized.  He is currently stable on the
   vent with diminishing O2 needs.

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp failure - new volume loss and possible effusion on left likely due
   to mucus plugging in setting of infection, will continue broad
   antibiotics. Increase PEEP and if his LLL does not re-aerate, a CT may
   be necessary to look for effusion.  Bronch to clear secretions from
   LLL. Less suspicious of PE, CHF.
   Hypotension - suspect related to infection. Received IVF and pressors
   now off. Will follow
   CML/allo-SCT/GVHD - continue outpatient regimen of immunosuppression
   though will increase steroids briefly, continue prophylactic regimen.
   Elevated troponin - improving, unclear significance, follow EKG
   Diarrhea - check CDiff

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). He has been admitted multiple times for respiratory infections. Over the past five days, the patient has been experiencing worsening dyspnea and became short of breath at home after an episode of diarrhea. He was found to have a pulse oximetry reading in the 70s and was sent to the emergency room. In the ER, he required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemia. A chest X-ray showed opacity in the left lower lobe, which could be either an infiltrate or effusion. The patient also required central venous access placement and was placed on levophed for hemodynamic support. He received intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. His pressors have been weaned, and his hemodynamics have stabilized. The patient is currently stable on mechanical ventilation with diminishing oxygen needs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to mucus plugging in the setting of an infection. If the left lower lobe (LLL) does not re-aerate, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be necessary to look for an effusion. Bronchoscopic clearance of secretions from the LLL is recommended.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is suspected to be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). Over the past five days, he has been experiencing worsening dyspnea and became short of breath at home after an episode of diarrhea. He was brought to the emergency room, where his pulse oximetry reading was in the 70s, and he was intubated due to respiratory failure. A chest X-ray showed a left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate, and he required central venous catheter (CVL) placement and vasopressor support with levophed. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, and his pressors have been weaned, with stabilization of his hemodynamics.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening dyspnea, low oxygen saturation, and subsequent intubation indicate respiratory failure. The LLL infiltrate seen on the chest X-ray suggests a possible infection leading to pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to infection and sepsis. He received intravenous fluids (IVF) and pressors, which have since been discontinued.
3. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML): The patient has a history of CML, for which he underwent allo-SCT. His current condition may be related to this underlying condition.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). He presented with worsening shortness of breath and was found to have respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient's recent medical history includes multiple admissions for respiratory infections, GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans/bronchiectasis, DVT/PE, and multiple pneumonias.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is currently stable on the ventilator with diminishing oxygen needs. His hemodynamics have stabilized, and he has been weaned off pressors. The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics to address the possible infection causing his respiratory failure. There is a concern about volume loss and possible effusion on the left lung due to mucus plugging. If the left lower lobe (LLL) does not re-aerate, a CT scan may be necessary to look for effusion. The patient's hypotension is suspected to be related to infection, and he has received intravenous fluids (IVF) and pressors which are now off. His outpatient regimen of immunosuppression for CML/allo-SCT/GVHD will continue, with an increase in steroids briefly. Prophylactic measures include lovenox for DVT/PE, and routine ICU care such as nutrition, glycemic control, and line management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp failure - new volume loss and possible effusion on left likely due
   to mucus plugging in setting of infection, will continue broad
   antibiotics. Increase PEEP and if his LLL does not re-aerate, a CT may
   be necessary to look for effusion.  Bronch to clear secretions from
   LLL. Less suspicious of PE, CHF.
   Hypotension - suspect related to infection. Received IVF and pressors
   now off. Will follow
   CML/allo-SCT/GVHD - continue outpatient regimen of immunosuppression
   though will increase steroids briefly, continue prophylactic regimen.
   Elevated troponin - improving, unclear significance, follow EKG
   Diarrhea - check CDiff
   DVT/PE - continue lovenox
   Elevated LFTs - follow, may be GVHD, image if necessary

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). He presents with respiratory failure and has been admitted multiple times for respiratory infections. The patient's current symptoms include worsening dyspnea, diarrhea, and hypoxia. He was intubated in the emergency room due to low oxygen saturation levels and a chest X-ray revealed opacity in the left lower lobe (LLL), which could be an infiltrate or effusion.

The patient required central venous line placement and was placed on levophed for hemodynamic support. He received intravenous fluids (IVF) and broad-spectrum antibiotics. His pressors have been weaned, and his hemodynamics have stabilized. He is currently stable on the ventilator with diminishing oxygen needs.

The patient's medical history includes GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans/bronchiectasis, DVT/PE, and multiple pneumonias. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent episode of diarrhea. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64-83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side, no wheez"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male w past medical history of CML s/p BMT in [**2121**] on
   chronic immunosuppression, w recent hospitalizations for his
   bronchiolitis obliterans and for resistant pseudomonal infections,
   presenting w respiratory distress and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of his chronic lung
   disease.  He would be likely to have mucus plugging but Bronch last
   night didn
t show any significant secretions or mucus plugging.  PE
   less likely w chronic anticoagulation
possible, but appears to be
   septic.  [**Month (only) 60**] have some worsening of his bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans.
   - Pt comfortable on PEEP 10
 try decreasing PEEP slowly to see how he
   tolerates it
   - Broad-spectrum coverage w zosyn and linezolid for now to cover
   multiple organisms w various drug resistance patterns
   - f/u w ID Abx recs
   - f/u Endotracheal sputum for culture
   - Non-contrast Chest CT b/c his lung parenchyma so complex; difficult
   to assess his lungs by xray
   .
   # Hypotension:
   Likely secondary to sepsis because patient's BP did not appear to
   respond to fluids in the ED, and he presented w bandemia of 33% lactate
   of 3.5.  Has been weaned off norepinephrine and MAPs stable in low 70s
   so far w good urine output.
   - IVF boluses as needed for BP and urine output
   - continue linezolid, zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has
   grown out in past
   - f/u w ID Recs regarding complicated hx of multiple organisms w strong
   resistance patterns
   - holding home metoprolol
   .
   # CML s/p BMT, Chronic GVHD, immunosuppression:
   Chronic Abdominal pain. needs stress dose steroids, but consider he
   needs to fight infection and should not be further suppressed w
   steroids.
   - IV methylpredisolone Q8h
   - needs increase in PPI dose
   - needs sliding scale insulin for increased steroid dose
   - trend LFTs
   - cont cellcept
   - cont bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole for prophylaxis
   .
   # Troponin Leak:
   Trop in ED was elevated to 0.66 and trended down, but CK and CK-MB were
   normal. EKG did not show any changes (inferior lead non-specific Twave
   changes were in previous EKGs). Not likely to be an ACS. [**Month (only) 60**] have had
   some demand ischemia related to hypotension.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Diarrhea:
   Pt has had multiple recent hospitalizations on strong antibiotics, and
   he was just discharged from Rehab prior to this admission. He is on
   multiple antibiotics for his home prophylactic regimen as well. Likely
   has an antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have a GVHD-associated
   diarrhea.
   - cf/u C. diff
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Hx of PE, DVT:
   Has hx of multiple PEs in [**2122**] and DVT in early [**2123**]. Needs chronic
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue on home dose of lovenox , 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Multiple Vertebral Fractures
   - back brace from home
   - pain control w fentanyl patches and has IV fentanyl for sedation on
   Vent
   - have held some of his home pain meds (e.g., methadone), which should
   be added back when he is no longer on sedation
   .
   # hx of GERD
   - Lansoprazole via NG tube

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) and chronic immunosuppression. He presented with respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia in the setting of chronic lung disease. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 112/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including chronic bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans, resistant pseudomonal infections, diarrhea (possibly antibiotic-associated or GVHD-associated), a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), multiple vertebral fractures, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (zosyn and linezolid) to cover multiple organisms with various drug resistance patterns. Other medications include fentanyl patches and IV fentanyl for pain control, lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male w past medical history of CML s/p BMT in [**2121**] on
   chronic immunosuppression, w recent hospitalizations for his
   bronchiolitis obliterans and for resistant pseudomonal infections,
   presenting w respiratory distress and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   His respiratory distress may be secondary to pneumonia in the setting
   of his chronic lung disease. Also in the differential, he may have
   mucus plugging or worsening of his bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis
   obliterans, which were thought to be secondary to his GVH.  PE less
   likely, but to consider given his history of multiple PEs in the past
   and multiple recent hospitalizations.  Less likely to have CHF, as he
   has no history of systolic or diastolic dysfunction.  Patient was
   intubated in ER after hypercapneic and hypoxic w non-rebreather.
   - on Assist Control w PEEP of 5.  Try to recruit more alveoli by
   increasing PEEP, and wean down FiO2 as tolerated, following O2sats for
   oxygenation
   - draw VBG and ABG to correlate them, so that we can follow VBGs for
   ventilation
   - Broad-spectrum coverage w zosyn and linezolid for now to cover
   multiple organisms w various drug resistance patterns
   - Endotracheal sputum for culture
   - Bronchoscopy for BAL and to clean out any mucus
   - Consider Chest CT in AM if CXR unimproved
   .
   # Hypotension:
   Likely secondary to sepsis because patient's BP did not appear to
   respond to fluids in the ED. He does have a bandemia of 33% and an
   increased lactate of 3.5.  Admitted to ICU w norepinephrine.  CVP=9.
   - titrate off pressors, goal MAP >65
   - IVF boluses as needed for BP
   - check central venous O2sat w next ABG/VBG
   - start linezolid, zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has
   grown out in past
   - consult ID in AM regarding complicated hx of multiple organisms w
   strong resistance patterns
   - holding home metoprolol
   .
   # CML s/p BMT, Chronic GVHD, immunosuppression:
   Chronic Abdominal pain. needs stress dose steroids, but consider he
   needs to fight infection and should not be further suppressed w
   steroids.
   - IV methylpredisolone Q8h
   - trend LFTs
   - cont cellcept
   - cont bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole for prophylaxis
   .
   # Troponin Leak:
   Trop in ED was elevated to 0.66. EKG did not show any changes (inferior
   lead non-specific Twave changes were in previous EKGs), and CK & CK-MB
   were normal. Repeat trop 0.26. Not likely to be an ACS. [**Month (only) 60**] have had
   some demand ischemia related to hypotension.
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # Diarrhea:
   Pt has had multiple recent hospitalizations on strong antibiotics, and
   he was just discharged from Rehab prior to this admission. He is on
   multiple antibiotics for his home prophylactic regimen as well. Likely
   has an antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have a GVHD-associated
   diarrhea.
   - check C. diff
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Hx of PE, DVT:
   Has hx of multiple PEs in [**2122**] and DVT in early [**2123**]. Needs chronic
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue on home dose of lovenox , 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Multiple Vertebral Fractures
   - back brace?
   - pain control w fentanyl patches and has IV fentanyl for sedation on
   Vent
   - have held some of his home pain meds (e.g., methadone), which should
   be added back when he is no longer on sedation
   .
   # hx of GERD
   - Lansoprazole via NG tube

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT), chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and immunosuppression. The patient has been admitted multiple times for bronchiolitis obliterans and resistant Pseudomonas infections. He presents with respiratory distress and hypotension.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient may have pneumonia, mucus plugging, worsening bronchiectasis, or bronchiolitis obliterans. A broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen has been initiated, and a bronchoscopy is planned for BAL and to clear any mucus. Consideration is also given to a chest CT if the chest X-ray does not show improvement.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely secondary to sepsis, as it did not respond to fluids in the emergency department. He has bandemia and an elevated lactate level. Norepinephrine has been started, and the goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65. IV fluids will be given as needed, and a central venous oxygen saturation will be checked with the next arterial blood gas/venous blood gas.
3. CML s/p BMT, Chronic GVHD, immunosuppression: The patient has chronic abdominal pain and requires stress dose steroids but"

   have low suspicion for chf, pe to explain his resp failure and
   presentation.  S/p bronch with cx
s sent and with minimal airway
   secretions.   His new volume loss at L base appears improved after
   intubation and bronch though he continues to have some chronic LLL
   collapse and probably small effusion at the L base.
        Will pursue CT chest to eval further.  We continue broad empiric
   antibx given hx of resistant bugs with help from ID team guiding
   coverage.  Would, continue aggressive chest pt, pulm toilet, sx and
   nebs.  He is still on a lot of peep 910).  Will assess on decreased
   peep, to move toward extubation.
   # Hypotension - suspect related to infection and peri-intubation
   sedation and also some intravascular depletion given diarrhea.
   Received IVF and pressors now off.  Will recheck lactate level and
   follow cvps and urine outpt.  Continue stress steroids for now,
   tapering back to home dose in next 48 hrs.
   # CML/allo-SCT/GVHD - continue outpatient regimen of immunosuppression
   aside from increased steroids briefly, continue prophylactic regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and has a history of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting his liver, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. The patient also has a history of resistant respiratory infections and poor secretion clearance.

The patient presented to the emergency department with hypoxemia and was found to have an opacity in the left lower lobe (LLL) of his lung on a chest X-ray. He was intubated, received vasopressors, and stress steroids. In the ICU, the patient's condition improved with weaning off of pressors and FIO2. A bronchoscopy was performed, showing minimal airway secretions.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, lactate, and liver enzymes. His troponin levels are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal chronic changes in the LLL of the lung, including atelectasis and bronchiectasis.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure - likely due to plugging and chronic GVHD of the lung with bronchiectasis and poor secretion clearance.
2. Hypotension - possibly related to infection, peri-intubation sedation, and intravascular depletion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp failure appears most-likely [**12-20**] plugging, pna given chronic GVHD
   of lung with sig bronchietasis and secretion clearance. His
   new/worsening volume loss at L base is slightly improved after
   intuabtion and bronch though he continues to have some chronic LLL
   copllapse.  Would pursue CT chest to eval further.  Continue btoad
   antibx given hx of resiteant bugs with help from ID rteam guiding
   empiric coverage.  S/p bronch with smaples sent and with minimal airway
   secretions.  Would assess on slightly lower peep, continue aggressive
   chest pt, pulm toilet, sx and nebs. Continuie with low suspicion for
   chf, pe to expolain his resp failure and presentation.  Will check
   chest CT.  and work toward extuabtion.
   Hypotension - suspect related to infection and peri-intubation sedation
   and also some intravascualr depetion with diarrhea.  Received IVF and
   pressors now off.  Will recheck lactate level and follow cvps and urine
   outpt.  Continue stress steroids for now, liekly tapering back to home
   dose in next 48 hrs.
   CML/allo-SCT/GVHD - continue outpatient regimen of immunosuppression
   though will increase steroids briefly, continue prophylactic regimen.
   Elevated troponin - improving, unclear significance, no acute changes.
   Suspect some demand ischmeia related to sepsis.
   Diarrhea
 chronic, suspect related to GVHD, check Cdiff cx

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure and hypoxemia. 

The patient's medical history includes graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and presumed lung (oxygen dependency, bronchiolitis obliterans). He was recently admitted for resistant pneumonia caused by Escherichia coli (ESBL E. coli), Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA), along with plugging and poor secretion clearance. The patient was discharged from rehab yesterday.

In the emergency department, the patient received vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. He was intubated for hypoxemia and fatigue, and unresponsive to intravenous fluids with catecholamines started. Troponin levels were elevated without acute ECG changes. Stress steroids were administered.

In the ICU, the patient's condition has been managed with levophed weaned off, FiO2 weaned to 50%, bronchoscopy performed with endotracheal tube, and antibiotherapy switched to linezolid, zosyn in conjunction with input from the infectious diseases team.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male w past medical history of CML s/p BMT in [**2121**] on
   chronic immunosuppression, w recent hospitalizations for his
   bronchiolitis obliterans and for resistant pseudomonal infections,
   presenting w respiratory distress and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of his chronic lung
   disease.  He would be likely to have mucus plugging but Bronch didn
   show any significant secretions or mucus plugging, but he had been
   suctioned aggressively prior to bronch.  Could also be related to
   worsening of his bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans.
   - Pt doing well on PS of [**3-21**], RSBI on 5/0 was 25, will attempt SBT this
   morning for possible extubation
   - Broad-spectrum coverage w zosyn and linezolid for now to cover
   multiple organisms w various drug resistance patterns, will complete a
   10 day course for presumed HAP
today is day [**12-28**]
   - f/u fungal markers
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - Chest CT concerning for LLL PNA vs. bronchiectasis/atelectasis, has
   had similar appearances on prior CT
   - F/U C.diff once patient has a BM, if diarrhea worsens will
   empirically start patient on po Vancomycin pending C.diff results
   - F/U repeat sputum cx, and blood cx
   .
   # Hypotension:
   Likely secondary to sepsis because patient's BP did not appear to
   respond to fluids in the ED, and he presented w bandemia of 33% lactate
   of 3.5.  Has remained off pressors and has had good urine output,
   between 40-60cc/hr.
   - Lactate has normalized at 0.8, bandemia has resolved with abx
   treatment
   - IVF boluses as needed for BP and urine output
   - continue linezolid, zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has
   grown out in past, day [**12-28**]
   - Low threshold for empiric po Vancomycin for worsening diarrhea
   - holding home metoprolol
   .
   # CML s/p allo SCT, Chronic GVHD of lung/liver/GI tract,
   immunosuppression: started stress dose steroids will continue while he
   is intubated, but will discontinue on extubation, and resumed home dose
   - IV methylpredisolone Q8h
   - continue sliding scale insulin with increased steroid dose
   - trend LFTs
   - cont cellcept
   - cont bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole for prophylaxis
   .
   # Troponin Leak:
   Trop in ED was elevated to 0.66 and trended down, but CK and CK-MB were
   normal.  Likely to have been related to demand ischemia in the setting
   of hypotension.
   - troponins trended down to 0.19, and his CK  and index remained normal
   throughout his course
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Diarrhea:  Pt. with GVHD in GI, recent abx use both for recent
   infection and continued home doses for ppx
   - Per ID could also be related to cytokine GI hypermobility with the
   start of his pneumonia, the improvement in diarrhea with antibiotic
   treatment for pneumonia also argues that this is the case
   - Send c.diff once patient has a BM, if diarrhea worsens will
   empirically start po vanco pending C.diff results
   .
   # Hx of PE, DVT:
   Has hx of multiple PEs in [**2122**] and DVT in early [**2123**]. Needs chronic
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue on home dose of lovenox , 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Multiple Vertebral Fractures
   - back brace from home
   - pain control w fentanyl and lidocaine patches and has IV fentanyl for
   sedation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] restart po meds post extubation

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male w past medical history of CML s/p BMT in [**2121**] on
   chronic immunosuppression, w recent hospitalizations for his
   bronchiolitis obliterans and for resistant pseudomonal infections,
   presenting w respiratory distress and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of his chronic lung
   disease.  He would be likely to have mucus plugging but Bronch didn
   show any significant secretions or mucus plugging, but he had been
   suctioned aggressively prior to bronch.  Could also be related to
   worsening of his bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans.
   - Pt doing well on PS of [**3-21**], RSBI on 5/0 was 25, will attempt SBT this
   morning for possible extubation
   - Broad-spectrum coverage w zosyn and linezolid for now to cover
   multiple organisms w various drug resistance patterns, will complete a
   10 day course for presumed HAP
today is day [**12-28**]
   - f/u fungal markers
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - Chest CT concerning for LLL PNA vs. bronchiectasis/atelectasis, has
   had similar appearances on prior CT
   - F/U C.diff once patient has a BM, if diarrhea worsens will
   empirically start patient on po Vancomycin pending C.diff results
   - F/U repeat sputum cx, and blood cx
   .
   # Hypotension:
   Likely secondary to sepsis because patient's BP did not appear to
   respond to fluids in the ED, and he presented w bandemia of 33% lactate
   of 3.5.  Has remained off pressors and has had good urine output,
   between 40-60cc/hr.
   - Lactate has normalized at 0.8, bandemia has resolved with abx
   treatment
   - IVF boluses as needed for BP and urine output
   - continue linezolid, zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has
   grown out in past, day [**12-28**]
   - Low threshold for empiric po Vancomycin for worsening diarrhea
   - holding home metoprolol
   .
   # CML s/p allo SCT, Chronic GVHD of lung/liver/GI tract,
   immunosuppression: started stress dose steroids will continue while he
   is intubated, but will discontinue on extubation, and resumed home dose
   - IV methylpredisolone Q8h
   - continue sliding scale insulin with increased steroid dose
   - trend LFTs
   - cont cellcept
   - cont bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole for prophylaxis
   .
   # Troponin Leak:
   Trop in ED was elevated to 0.66 and trended down, but CK and CK-MB were
   normal.  Likely to have been related to demand ischemia in the setting
   of hypotension.
   - troponins trended down to 0.19, and his CK  and index remained normal
   throughout his course
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Diarrhea:  Pt. with GVHD in GI, recent abx use both for recent
   infection and continued home doses for ppx
   - Per ID could also be related to cytokine GI hypermobility with the
   start of his pneumonia, the improvement in diarrhea with antibiotic
   treatment for pneumonia also argues that this is the case
   - Send c.diff once patient has a BM, if diarrhea worsens will
   empirically start po vanco pending C.diff results
   .
   # Hx of PE, DVT:
   Has hx of multiple PEs in [**2122**] and DVT in early [**2123**]. Needs chronic
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue on home dose of lovenox , 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Multiple Vertebral Fractures
   - back brace from home
   - pain control w fentanyl and lidocaine patches and has IV fentanyl for
   sedation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] restart po meds post extubation

   [**Name (NI) 66**] status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT), chronic immunosuppression, recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans and resistant pseudomonal infections, presenting with respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient has several medical complications and comorbidities that need to be considered in the summary.

The patient is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of his chronic lung disease. He is doing well on pressure support of 5 (PS 5/5) and has a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 25. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning for possible extubation.

The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis, as his blood pressure did not respond to fluids in the emergency department and he presented with bandemia and elevated lactate levels. The lactate has normalized at 0.8, and bandemia has resolved with antibiotic treatment. The patient is off pressors and has good urine output.

The patient has a history of CML post allo SCT, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the lung/liver/GI tract, and immunosuppression. Stress dose steroids have been started while the patient is intubated, but will be discontinued on extubation, and"

   [**Name (NI) 66**] status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT), chronic immunosuppression, recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans and resistant pseudomonal infections, presenting with respiratory distress and hypotension. 

The patient's current condition shows improvement with good urine output, normalized lactate levels, and resolution of bandemia after antibiotic treatment. The patient is expected to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning for possible extubation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which may be secondary to his chronic lung disease such as bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans. The pneumonia could lead to worsening respiratory distress and failure if not adequately managed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, as indicated by the lack of response to fluids in the emergency department and bandemia. Close monitoring of blood pressure and urine output is necessary. 

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has diarrhea, which could be related to GVHD or recent antibiotic use. C. diff infection is a concern, and stool sample should be sent once the patient has a bowel movement. Empirical treatment with oral vancomycin may be required if diarrhea wors"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male w past medical history of CML s/p BMT in [**2121**] on
   chronic immunosuppression, w recent hospitalizations for his
   bronchiolitis obliterans and for resistant pseudomonal infections,
   presenting w respiratory distress and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of his chronic lung
   disease.  He would be likely to have mucus plugging but Bronch didn
   show any significant secretions or mucus plugging, but he had been
   suctioned aggressively prior to bronch.  Could also be related to
   worsening of his bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans.
   - Pt doing well on PS of [**3-21**], RSBI on 5/0 was 25, will attempt SBT this
   morning for possible extubation
   - Broad-spectrum coverage w zosyn and linezolid for now to cover
   multiple organisms w various drug resistance patterns, will complete a
   10 day course for presumed HAP
today is day [**12-28**]
   - f/u fungal markers
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - Chest CT concerning for LLL PNA vs. bronchiectasis/atelectasis, has
   had similar appearances on prior CT
   - F/U C.diff once patient has a BM, if diarrhea worsens will
   empirically start patient on po Vancomycin pending C.diff results
   - F/U repeat sputum cx, and blood cx
   .
   # Hypotension:
   Likely secondary to sepsis because patient's BP did not appear to
   respond to fluids in the ED, and he presented w bandemia of 33% lactate
   of 3.5.  Has remained off pressors and has had good urine output,
   between 40-60cc/hr.
   - Lactate has normalized at 0.8, bandemia has resolved with abx
   treatment
   - IVF boluses as needed for BP and urine output
   - continue linezolid, zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has
   grown out in past, day [**12-28**]
   - Low threshold for empiric po Vancomycin for worsening diarrhea
   - holding home metoprolol for now
   .
   # CML s/p allo SCT, Chronic GVHD of lung/liver/GI tract,
   immunosuppression: started stress dose steroids will continue while he
   is intubated, but will discontinue on extubation, and resumed home dose
   - restart home steroid dose post extubation
   - continue sliding scale insulin with increased steroid dose
   - trend LFTs
   - cont cellcept
   - cont bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole for prophylaxis
   .
   # Troponin Leak:
   Trop in ED was elevated to 0.66 and trended down, but CK and CK-MB were
   normal.  Likely to have been related to demand ischemia in the setting
   of hypotension.
   - troponins trended down to 0.19, and his CK  and index remained normal
   throughout his course
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Diarrhea:  Pt. with GVHD in GI, recent abx use both for recent
   infection and continued home doses for ppx
   - Per ID could also be related to cytokine GI hypermobility with the
   start of his pneumonia, the improvement in diarrhea with antibiotic
   treatment for pneumonia also argues that this is the case
   - Send c.diff once patient has a BM, if diarrhea worsens will
   empirically start po vanco pending C.diff results
   - will restart a GVHD diet to help decrease diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of PE, DVT:
   Has hx of multiple PEs in [**2122**] and DVT in early [**2123**]. Needs chronic
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue on home dose of lovenox , 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Multiple Vertebral Fractures
   - back brace from home
   - pain control w fentanyl and lidocaine patches and has IV fentanyl for
   sedation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] restart po meds post extubation
   .
   # hx of GERD
   - Lansoprazole via NG tube, will change to po once extubated
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO while patient is intubated, will advance diet post
   extubation

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 2021, chronic immunosuppression, recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans and resistant pseudomonal infections, presenting with respiratory distress and hypotension. 

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically left lower lobe opacification, which could be secondary to infectious pneumonia and/or atelectasis.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on FiO2 of 40%.
- His recent blood cultures show improvement, with a decrease in bandemia and normalization of lactate levels.
- The patient has a history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting his lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, for which he is on immunosuppressive therapy.
- He also has a history of multiple pulmonary embolisms and deep vein thrombosis, requiring chronic anticoagulation.
- The patient has multiple vertebral fractures and is on pain management with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.
- He has a history of GERD and will be started on lansoprazole once extubated.
- The patient's daily fluid balance shows a positive balance of 479 mL, with total input of 1,719 mL and total output of 1,240 mL.
- His daily weight is 74 kg, with an admission weight of 73.7 kg.
- The patient has ecchymotic lesions and 3+ lower extremity pitting edema.
- His skin is described as very thin and delicate with skin tears, dark ecchymoses, and erythema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypotension could be due to pneumonia in the setting of his chronic lung disease, such as bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans. There is also a possibility of mucus plugging or worsening of bronchiectasis contributing to the respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to sepsis, as his blood pressure did not respond to fluids in the emergency department, and he presented with bandemia and elevated lactate levels. However, his blood pressure has improved with antibiotic treatment, and he has maintained good urine output.
3. CML s/p allo SCT, Chronic GVHD of lung/liver/GI tract, immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to chronic GVHD increases the risk of opportunistic infections. Stress dose steroids will be continued while he is intubated and then resumed post-extubation.
4. Troponin Leak: The patient had an elevated troponin level initially, which trended down, suggesting demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension. However, his CK and CK-MB levels remained normal.
5. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea could be related to GVHD in the GI tract, recent antibiotic use, or cytokine GI hypermobility. Monitoring for Clostridium difficile infection is important, and empirical treatment may be considered if diarrhea worsens.
6. History of PE, DVT: The patient has a history of multiple pulmonary embolisms and deep vein thrombosis, requiring chronic anticoagulation.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male w past medical history of CML s/p BMT in [**2121**] on
   chronic immunosuppression, w recent hospitalizations for his
   bronchiolitis obliterans and for resistant pseudomonal infections,
   presenting w respiratory distress and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of his chronic lung
   disease.  He would be likely to have mucus plugging but Bronch didn
   show any significant secretions or mucus plugging, but he had been
   suctioned aggressively prior to bronch.  Could also be related to
   worsening of his bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans.
   - Pt doing well on PS of [**3-21**], RSBI on 5/0 was 25, will attempt SBT this
   morning for possible extubation
   - Broad-spectrum coverage w zosyn and linezolid for now to cover
   multiple organisms w various drug resistance patterns
   - f/u fungal markers
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - Chest CT concerning for LLL PNA vs. bronchiectasis/atelectasis, has
   had similar appearances on prior CT
   - F/U C.diff once patient has a BM
   .
   # Hypotension:
   Likely secondary to sepsis because patient's BP did not appear to
   respond to fluids in the ED, and he presented w bandemia of 33% lactate
   of 3.5.  Has been weaned off norepinephrine and MAPs stable in low 70s
   so far w good urine output.
   - IVF boluses as needed for BP and urine output
   - continue linezolid, zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has
   grown out in past
   - f/u w ID Recs regarding complicated hx of multiple organisms w strong
   resistance patterns
   - holding home metoprolol
   .
   # CML s/p BMT, Chronic GVHD, immunosuppression:
   Chronic Abdominal pain. needs stress dose steroids, but consider he
   needs to fight infection and should not be further suppressed w
   steroids.
   - IV methylpredisolone Q8h
   - needs increase in PPI dose
   - needs sliding scale insulin for increased steroid dose
   - trend LFTs
   - cont cellcept
   - cont bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole for prophylaxis
   .
   # Troponin Leak:
   Trop in ED was elevated to 0.66 and trended down, but CK and CK-MB were
   normal. EKG did not show any changes (inferior lead non-specific Twave
   changes were in previous EKGs). Not likely to be an ACS. [**Month (only) 60**] have had
   some demand ischemia related to hypotension.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Diarrhea:
   Pt has had multiple recent hospitalizations on strong antibiotics, and
   he was just discharged from Rehab prior to this admission. He is on
   multiple antibiotics for his home prophylactic regimen as well. Likely
   has an antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have a GVHD-associated
   diarrhea.

   # Multiple Vertebral Fractures
   - back brace from home
   - pain control w fentanyl patches and has IV fentanyl for sedation on
   Vent
   - have held some of his home pain meds (e.g., methadone), which should
   be added back when he is no longer on sedation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) and is experiencing complications related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 

The patient presents with respiratory failure, hypotension, and poor secretion clearance. He has a history of multiple admissions for resistant respiratory infections. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient appears to have an obstruction in his airway, likely due to mucus plugging. Chronic GVHD of the lung, along with bronchiectasis and poor secretion clearance, are contributing factors. The patient's chest X-ray shows collapse/atelectasis at the left lower lobe (LLL), which is consistent with previous CT scans. Empirical coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated, including Zosyn and linezolid. Fungal markers are pending. The patient is doing well on spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and seems ready for extubation. Secretions have been minimal. Pulmonary toilet, flutter valve, and nebulizer treatments will continue to assist with secretion clearance. 

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension in the setting of peri-intubation, infusions, and diarrhea. Resolved with intravenous fluids (IVFs) and off pressors since arrival to ICU. The patient will"

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  58  M w/ CML s/p allo- SCT, GVHD liver, GI
   track, and presumed lung (O2 dep BO), multiple recent admission for
   resistant resp infections and poor secretion clearance,  who presented
   with respiratory failure and hypotension in setting of LLL atelectasis
   / pna.  He was successfully extubated yesterday and is now comfortable
   appearing on 4L NC.
   He remains AF with stable BP and HR.  O2 sats 98% on 2L.  He is alert
   and in NAD.  Lungs with distant BS and end exp wheeze appreciated.  His
   heart is regular. Abd is distended but soft, + BS, with stable mildl
   diffuse tenderness. His LE skin changes are stable.
   His labs were reviewed and are noted above.
   A/P: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 10586**] is doing well from a respiratory standpoint post
   -extubation.  He remains normotensive with good urine output. We are
   treating for pna given CT findings with LLL collapse / atelectasis
   noting no positive cx data to guide and minimal secretions seen on
   bronch.  We will continue zosyn/linezolid to complete a 10 day course.
   Picc line was placed at bedside, but needs to be repositioned by IR,
   after which we will pull his CVL. Will continue with pulm toilet, nebs,
   flutter valve or incentive spirometer to assist with secretion
   clearance.  We will work to optimize his chronic pain control from
   vertebral fractures as this will help further with his breathing. Will
   continue his outpt regimen of fent patch, lido patch, methadone, lyrica
   and morphine and have him use his brace when sitting up.  If pain
   control remains suboptimal once back on home doses, would consider
   increasing his methadone.  His diarrhea is chronic, now better, and we
   suspect is related to GVHD, but checking C diff given frequent antibx.
   We continue his outpatient CML/allo-SCT/GVHD regimen of
   immunosuppression and prophylaxsis. Will ask PT to work with him given
   deconditioning.  Remainder as per resident note.
   He is stable for transfer to BMT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT), chronic immunosuppression, recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans and resistant pseudomonal infections, presenting with respiratory distress and hypotension. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans, and still needs to finish an antibiotic course for lower left lobe (LLL) pneumonia. Stress dose steroids have been stopped, and the patient is being returned to home dose prednisone.

2. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and urine output is between 100cc/hr. Lactate has normalized at 0.8, and bandemia has resolved with antibiotic treatment. The patient will continue on linezolid and Zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has grown out in the past.

3. CML s/p allo SCT, Chronic GVHD of lung/liver/GI tract, immunosuppression: The patient is on multiple medications for prophylaxis, including budesonide, cellcept, and antibiotics. GVHD diet has been restarted to help decrease diarrhea and restarted home budesonide.

4. Hx of PE, DVT: The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male w past medical history of CML s/p BMT in [**2121**] on
   chronic immunosuppression, w recent hospitalizations for his
   bronchiolitis obliterans and for resistant pseudomonal infections,
   presenting w respiratory distress and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Extubated successfully yesterday.  Has underlying bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans.  Still needs to finish antibiotic course for
   LLL pneumonia.  Stress dose steroids stopped yesterday and returned to
   home dose prednisone.
   - PICC line confirmation to finish zosyn course on floor and at home
   - Broad-spectrum coverage w zosyn and PO linezolid , day#[**1-25**]
   - f/u fungal markers
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - F/U C.diff once patient has a BM, if diarrhea worsens will
   empirically start patient on po Vancomycin pending C.diff results
   - F/U repeat sputum cx, and blood cx
   .
   # Hypotension/Sepsis:
   Not requiring pressors, urine output between 100cc/hr.
   - Lactate has normalized at 0.8, bandemia has resolved with abx
   treatment
   - IVF boluses as needed for BP and urine output
   - continue linezolid, zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has
   grown out in past, day [**12-28**]
   - Low threshold for empiric po Vancomycin for worsening diarrhea
   - holding home metoprolol for now
   .
   # CML s/p allo SCT, Chronic GVHD of lung/liver/GI tract,
   immunosuppression: started stress dose steroids will continue while he
   is intubated, but will discontinue on extubation, and resumed home dose
   - restarted home budesonide dose
   - continue sliding scale insulin with increased steroid dose
   - trend LFTs
   - cont cellcept
   - cont bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole for prophylaxis
   .
   # Troponin Leak:
   Trop in ED was elevated to 0.66 and trended down, but CK and CK-MB were
   normal.  Likely to have been related to demand ischemia in the setting
   of hypotension.
   - troponins trended down to 0.19, and his CK  and index remained normal
   throughout his course
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Diarrhea:  Pt. with GVHD in GI, recent abx use both for recent
   infection and continued home doses for ppx
   - Per ID could also be related to cytokine GI hypermobility with the
   start of his pneumonia, the improvement in diarrhea with antibiotic
   treatment for pneumonia also argues that this is the case
   - Send c.diff once patient has a BM, if diarrhea worsens will
   empirically start po vanco pending C.diff results
   - restart GVHD diet to help decrease diarrhea and restarted home
   budesonide
   .
   # Hx of PE, DVT:
   Has hx of multiple PEs in [**2122**] and DVT in early [**2123**]. Needs chronic
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue on home dose of lovenox , 40mg [**Hospital1 **]

   # Multiple Vertebral Fractures
   - back brace from home
   - pain control w fentanyl and lidocaine patches and home po pain meds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) on chronic immunosuppression, recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans and resistant Pseudomonas infections, presenting with respiratory distress and hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient successfully extubated yesterday and has underlying bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans. He still needs to finish an antibiotic course for lower left lobe pneumonia. Stress dose steroids were stopped yesterday and he returned to home dose prednisone. The plan is to confirm PICC line to finish zosyn course on the floor and at home, continue with broad-spectrum coverage using zosyn and PO linezolid, follow-up fungal markers, ID following, appreciate recommendations, follow-up repeat sputum CXR, and blood CX.

2. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's blood pressure is stable without the need for pressors, and his urine output is within normal range. Lactate levels have normalized at 0.8, and bandemia has resolved with antibiotic treatment. IVF boluses will be given as needed for BP and urine output. The patient will continue on linezolid and zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has grown out in the past, day"

   Not requiring pressors, urine output between 40-60cc/hr.
   - Lactate has normalized at 0.8, bandemia has resolved with abx
   treatment
   - IVF boluses as needed for BP and urine output
   - continue linezolid, zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has
   grown out in past, day [**12-28**]
   - Low threshold for empiric po Vancomycin for worsening diarrhea
   - holding home metoprolol for now
   .
   # CML s/p allo SCT, Chronic GVHD of lung/liver/GI tract,
   immunosuppression: started stress dose steroids will continue while he
   is intubated, but will discontinue on extubation, and resumed home dose
   - restart home steroid dose post extubation
   - continue sliding scale insulin with increased steroid dose
   - trend LFTs
   - cont cellcept
   - cont bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole for prophylaxis
   .
   # Troponin Leak:
   Trop in ED was elevated to 0.66 and trended down, but CK and CK-MB were
   normal.  Likely to have been related to demand ischemia in the setting
   of hypotension.
   - troponins trended down to 0.19, and his CK  and index remained normal
   throughout his course
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Diarrhea:  Pt. with GVHD in GI, recent abx use both for recent
   infection and continued home doses for ppx
   - Per ID could also be related to cytokine GI hypermobility with the
   start of his pneumonia, the improvement in diarrhea with antibiotic
   treatment for pneumonia also argues that this is the case
   - Send c.diff once patient has a BM, if diarrhea worsens will
   empirically start po vanco pending C.diff results
   - will restart a GVHD diet to help decrease diarrhea

   # Hx of PE, DVT:
   Has hx of multiple PEs in [**2122**] and DVT in early [**2123**]. Needs chronic
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue on home dose of lovenox , 40mg [**Hospital1 **]

   # Multiple Vertebral Fractures
   - back brace from home
   - pain control w fentanyl and lidocaine patches and has IV fentanyl for
   sedation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] restart po meds post extubation

   [**Name (NI) 66**] status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) on chronic immunosuppression. The patient has had recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans and resistant pseudomonal infections. 

The patient presented with respiratory distress and hypotension. He was intubated but successfully extubated yesterday. He still requires finishing an antibiotic course for lower left lobe (LLL) pneumonia. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure due to underlying bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans, hypotension/sepsis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting the lungs/liver/GI tract, immunosuppression, troponin leak, and diarrhea. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans. He still needs to finish the antibiotic course for LLL pneumonia. Broad-spectrum coverage with zosyn and PO linezolid is recommended. Fungal markers should be followed up, and ID recommendations should be appreciated. Repeat sputum culture and blood culture should also be done.

2. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's urine output is between 40-60cc/hr, and lactate has normalized at 0.8, bandemia has resolved with antibiotic treatment. IVF boluses should be given as needed for BP and urine output. Continue linezolid and zosyn for now to broadly cover organisms he has grown out in the past. Low threshold for empiric PO vancomycin for worsening diarrhea.

3. CML s/p allo SCT, Chronic GVHD of lung/liver/GI tract, immunosuppression: Started stress dose steroids while the patient is intubated but will discontinue on extubation. Resumed home steroid dose post-extubation. Continue sliding scale insulin with increased steroid dose. Trend LFTs. Continue cellcept. Continue bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole for prophylaxis.

4. Troponin Leak: Trop in ED was elevated but CK and CK-MB were normal. Likely to have been related to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension. Troponins trended down to 0.19, and his CK and index remained normal throughout his course. Continue to monitor.

5. Diarrhea: The patient with GVHD in GI, recent abx use both for recent infection and continued home doses for ppx. Send c.diff once patient has a BM, if diarrhea worsens will empirically start po vanco pending C.diff results. Will restart a GVHD diet to help decrease diarrhea.

6. Hx of PE, DVT: The patient has a history of multiple"
