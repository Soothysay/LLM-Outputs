","Summary:
The patient in the ICU is experiencing a fever of 101.4°F (38.6°C) and has an uncertain origin. The patient's vital signs include a current temperature of 98.3°F (36.8°C), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/56-161/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support but has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or cardiac status. There is a balance of 0 mL in and out, indicating a negative fluid balance of 1045 mL since 12 AM. The patient's WBC count, Hct, Plt, Cr, Troponin T, TCO2, and glucose levels are all within normal ranges based on the lab results provided in the image. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, ICU medications, and prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of fever along with impaired skin integrity suggests the possibility of an infection leading to sepsis. Monitoring vital signs and lab results for any signs of deterioration is crucial.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's respiratory status with an oxygen saturation of 91% indicates potential respiratory compromise. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent right total knee replacement (TKR) who was transferred to the MICU overnight for hypoxia. The patient's urine culture grew E. coli likely extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing, so carbapenem was added to sensitivities. The patient received meropenem at 01:00 AM. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative. Autotitrated CPAP for sleep and no aspiration seen by speech/swallow evaluation. The patient diuresed 1.8L. EKG done, no change from prior. The patient has no known drug allergies. Other ICU medications and infusions are listed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient presented with hypoxia, likely due to combined congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonia (PNA). The patient's symptoms and hypoxia improved with diuresis overnight, but new fever and increasing white blood cell count suggest a superimposed infection such as aspiration PNA or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient was switched to meropenem/rifampin overnight.
2. Pneumonia: Given the new cough and chest X-ray findings, there is concern for pulmonary etiology, possibly aspiration pneumonia (ASA PNA). Sputum cultures and follow-up chest X-rays are needed.
3. CHF: The patient has diastolic CHF, and recent ECHO showed preserved systolic function. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated, indicating decompensated CHF. Continued diuresis and monitoring are required.
4. Infection in the gastrocnemius wound flap: The patient underwent a gastrocnemius flap procedure, but the wound is open. Although the patient denies pain at the surgical site, it should be considered as a potential source of infection. Routine post-operative care is being provided by the surgical/plastics team.
5. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels in the mid-20s, but the etiology is unclear. It may be multifactorial due to chronic disease, frequent phlebotomy, and blood loss from procedures. Monitoring and further evaluation are needed.
6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient requires regular low-salt diet with fluid restriction, monitoring of electrolytes, and repletion as needed.
7. Pressure ulcer prophylaxis: The patient continues to receive subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) in the morning, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and bowel regimen.
8. Possible discharge: If the patient continues to be stable on nasal cannula oxygen, chest X-ray negative, and EKG normal, consideration can be given to transferring the patient back to the surgical floor team.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details or tests may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a significant medical history of hypertension (HTN), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous right total knee replacement (TKR) with subsequent septic joint and gastrocnemius flap reconstruction. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) overnight for hypoxia.

The patient's urine culture grew E.coli, which is likely extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing. Therefore, carbapenem was added to the antibiotic regimen. Cardiac enzymes are negative three times, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. Autotitrated continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) was used during sleep with oxygen saturation (sats) ranging from 80-90%. The patient does not show any signs of aspiration, and diuresis of 1.8 liters was performed. The electrocardiogram (EKG) did not show any changes from the previous ones.

The patient experienced desaturation to 95% this morning but improved by sitting up and using a high-flow mask. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics, meropenem, was administered at 01:00 AM.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure, and recent right total knee replacement who was transferred to the MICU overnight for hypoxia. The patient's urine culture grew E. coli, likely extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing, and carbapenem was added to sensitivities. The cardiac enzymes are negative three times. The patient used autotitrated CPAP for sleep with oxygen saturation (sats) 80-90s overnight. There was no evidence of aspiration on speech/swallow evaluation. The patient diuresed 1.8 liters. The EKG showed no change from prior. The patient desaturated to 95% this morning and then improved with sitting up right and using a high-flow mask.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was meropenem at [**2188-4-10**] 01:00 AM. The patient is receiving other ICU medications. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for slight substernal pain with deep inspiration. 

The flowsheet data as of [**2188-4-10**] 07:00 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 83 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 162/68 mmHg to 165/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Total intake is 1370 mL, including 400 mL of IV fluids, and total output is 1720 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1755 mL. The patient is on CPAP with an oxygen delivery device of a face tent and has a saturation of 90%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert, awake, and not in distress (NAD) with a murmur of left lower sternal border (LLSB). Lung examination shows crackles at the bases bilaterally. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness or nodularity. The knee graft is with granulation tissue, and there is no lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.0 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 27.0%, platelet (Plt) count of 461 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.5 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.06, and glucose of 113 mg/dL. Other labs include PT/PTT/INR of 16.6/30.9/1.5, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T of 37/2/0.04, and a differential with neutrophils at 82.5%, lymphocytes at 9.3%, monocytes at 5.5%, eosinophils at 2.5%, calcium at 7.8 mg/dL, magnesium at 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphate at 3.6 mg/dL.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of hypoxia likely due to combined congestive heart failure (CHF) and possible pneumonia (PNA). The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) is concerning for pulmonary edema, and symptoms improved with diuresis the first night after admission. The patient switched to meropenem/rifampin on [**4-8**]. The patient was weaned down"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress, probable CHF
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to pulmonary edema, possible related
   to volume overload, cardiac ischemia or fever.  Wean supplimental
   oxygen.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- cardiogenic vs. noncardiogenic.  Initially mproved
   radiographically with diuresis (in setting of elevated BNP).  However,
   now with progressive infiltrates dispite net diuresis.   Possible
   aspiration (but less likely).  Doubt pulmonary embolism. Other
   considerations include alveolar hemmorrhage (delined Hct), evolving
   ARDS, infection (esp. viral) although doubt.   Plan repeat echo (?new
   walll motion abnormality, reassess valvular heart disease --> ?AS).
   Thoracic CT vs. CT angio.
   FEVER -- attributed to UTI (resistent organism).
   ANEMIA -- Monitor for bleeding.  COncern for occult GI bleed, alveolar
   hemorrhage.  Would favor maintaining Hct >27.
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   OSA -- need to better assess, consider CPAP
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance 1-2 L.  Monitor I/O.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has hypoxemia and is on supplemental oxygen. There is a concern for pulmonary edema, possibly due to volume overload, cardiac ischemia, or fever. The patient's respiratory support includes a face tent and increased FiO2 to maintain oxygenation.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has increased bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, predominantly in the upper lobes. This could indicate cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The initial improvement with diuresis suggests a possible volume-related cause, but the progressive infiltrates despite diuresis raise concerns for cardiogenic pulmonary edema or evolving ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

3. Fever: The patient has a fever attributed to a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a resistant organism. Further investigation and treatment are necessary to control the infection.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, which may be due to bleeding. There is a concern for occult gastrointestinal bleeding or alveolar hemorrhage. Monitoring for bleeding and maintaining a higher hematocrit level (>27) is recommended.

5. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which need to be repleted to maintain normal levels.

6. Infection after Knee Replacement: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress, probable CHF
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to pulmonary edema, possible related
   to volume overload, cardiac ischemia or fever.  Wean supplimental
   oxygen.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- cardiogenic vs. noncardiogenic.  Initially mproved
   radiographically with diuresis (in setting of elevated BNP).  However,
   now with progressive infiltrates dispite net diuresis.   Possible
   aspiration (but less likely).  Doubt pulmonary embolism. Other
   considerations include alveolar hemmorrhage (delined Hct), evolving
   ARDS, infection (esp. viral) although doubt.   Plan repeat echo (?new
   walll motion abnormality, reassess valvular heart disease --> ?AS).
   Thoracic CT vs. CT angio.
   FEVER -- attributed to UTI (resistent organism).
   ANEMIA -- Monitor for bleeding.  COncern for occult GI bleed, alveolar
   hemorrhage.  Would favor maintaining Hct >27.
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   OSA -- need to better assess, consider CPAP
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance 1-2 L.  Monitor I/O.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory distress with hypoxemia. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note.

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient has increased bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, indicating possible pulmonary edema. This could be cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic in origin.

2. Infection: The patient has a fever attributed to a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a resistant organism. Additionally, there is a concern for possible infection related to the right knee replacement surgery.

3. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level (7.9 g/dL) and may require monitoring for bleeding. There is a concern for occult gastrointestinal bleeding or alveolar hemorrhage.

4. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels (K+ 3.3 mEq/L), which needs to be corrected to maintain normal heart function.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is at 90%, indicating inadequate oxygenation.

6. Fluid overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating potential fluid overload. This needs to be addressed to prevent further complications such as pulmonary edema.

7. Right knee pain: The patient is experiencing minimal pain in the right leg, specifically at the knee. This could be related to the recent knee replacement surgery.

8. Fever: The patient has a fever, which may indicate an underlying infection or"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a significant medical history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous right total knee replacement (TKR) with septic joint washout. He was transferred to the MICU overnight for hypoxia. 

The patient's overnight respiratory rate was in the 30s to 40s and was 85% on non-rebreather mask (NRB). He was then put on BiPAP with rates in the upper 20s and 30s and oxygen saturation in the 90s. Diuresis was given and resulted in negative 2 liters. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) at 6 and morning were not on BiPAP.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 82 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 140/56 mmHg to 75/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,515 mL and output of 3,900 mL with a negative balance of 2,385 mL.

The patient is receiving hydralazine and furosemide (Lasix) infusions. He has been on meropenem since April 8th and rifampin since April 13th. Other medications include lisinopril, metoprolol, amlodipine, enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis, PPI, and bowel regimen.

Laboratory results show white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.0, hemoglobin (Hct) of 27.0, platelet (Plt) count of 461,000, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.06, TCO2 level of 26, glucose level of 113 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.0 mmol/L. The differential includes neutrophils at 80.8%, lymphocytes at 10.7%, monocytes at 4.7%, eosinophils at 3.4%, and basophils at 0.2%. Other lab values include PT/INR/PTT at 17.1/1.5/33.8, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T at 41/2/0.05, and LDH at 349 IU/L. Electrolytes show calcium (Ca++) at 7.9 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) at 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) at 3.1 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxia likely due to combined CH"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a significant medical history including hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and recent right total knee replacement (TKR) with subsequent septic joint and gastrocnemius flap transfer. The patient was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and has since experienced several medical complications.

The patient's respiratory status has been a primary concern, with initial hypoxia that improved with diuresis and a change in antibiotics. The patient's condition worsened, leading to elective intubation due to increased respiratory rates. An echocardiogram showed moderate pulmonary hypertension, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, minimal aortic stenosis, and an ejection fraction of 55%. A CT scan revealed ground glass opacity in the perihilar and dependent regions, suggestive of aspiration pneumonia and possibly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Small bilateral pleural effusions were also noted, along with signs of pulmonary hypertension.

The patient has been on BiPAP with improved oxygen saturation in the 90s. He has been diuresed with Lasix, which has been effective. The patient's fever workup is ongoing, considering recent cough and chest X-ray findings, with concerns for possible aspiration pneumonia or other pulmonary etiologies. The patient's right knee is healing well without evidence of infection, although osteomyelitis cannot be completely ruled out.

The patient's cardiac status includes"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent right total knee replacement (TKR) who was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia. The patient's overnight respiratory rate was in the 30s to 40s and was 85% on nasal rapid flow (NRB). BiPAP was initiated with rates in the upper 20s and 30s and oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the 90s. The patient responded to lasix 60 IV. An arterial blood gas (ABG) at 6 and morning not on BiPAP showed a pH of 7.53, PaCO2 of 29, PaO2/FiO2 of 54, and HCO3- of 21 mEq/L. An echocardiogram revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, minimal aortic stenosis, and an ejection fraction (EF) of 55%. The patient had a brief nitro drip overnight. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed ground glass opacity in the perihilar and dependent regions, which could be consistent with aspiration pneumonia or developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There were also bilateral pleural effusions and signs of pulmonary hypertension. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a significant medical history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent right total knee replacement (TKR) that resulted in septic joint and gastrocnemius muscle flap transfer. He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) overnight for hypoxia.

During the past 24 hours, the patient's respiratory rate (RR) fluctuated between 30s to 40s and was 85% on nasal rapid flow (NRB). He was subsequently placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) with improved oxygen saturation levels in the 90s. Diuretics were administered, with a response to lasix 60 IV. Blood gases showed an increased partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, indicating improved oxygenation.

An echocardiogram revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, minimal aortic stenosis, and an ejection fraction of 55%. The patient received a nitro drip briefly overnight and was electively intubated in the morning due to increased RR. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed ground glass opacity in the perihilar and dependent regions, suggestive of aspiration pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Small bilateral pleural effusions and signs of pulmonary hypertension were also observed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent right total knee replacement (TKR) complicated by a septic joint which required washout. The patient was transferred to the MICU overnight for hypoxia. 

Overnight, the patient's respiratory rate increased to the 30s and 40s, and he was placed on BiPAP. Diuretics were given, resulting in a negative fluid balance but no significant response to lasix IV. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.53, PaCO2 of 29, HCO3- of 54, SaO2 of 98%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 54. The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) indicated pulmonary edema, and his symptoms and hypoxia improved with diuresis the first night after admission. The patient's condition has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's blood culture and sensitivity (S&S) evaluation is negative. He has been on meropenem and rifampin since [4-8] and [3-21], respectively. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is trending up. 

Further investigations and treatments include a bronchoscopy to check for blood sput"

   Imaging: CXR ([**2188-4-11**]) improved, reduced infiltrates, now intubated (ETT
   acceptable)
   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- Primary concern is pulmonary edema, possible
   related to volume overload, hypertension with flash pulmonary edema, or
   primary cardiac ischemia.  Chest CT reveals predominately dependent
   infiltrates, but cannot exclude areas of infection.  Other concerns
   include pulmonary hemorrhage/DAH, eosinophilic pneumonia, BOOP, ARDS,
   pyogenic pneumonia, atypical pneumonia or opportunistic infection.
   Resp. failure may also be precipitated by underlying infection, such as
   C. diff, line or wound infection.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg.  Plan for a-line.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- cardiogenic vs. noncardiogenic.  Variable
   radiographic appearance of infiltrates, with interval improvement
   overnight.   However, now with frank bleeding.   Possible aspiration
   (but less likely).  Doubt pulmonary embolism. Other considerations
   include alveolar hemmorrhage (declined Hct), evolving ARDS, infection
   (esp. viral) although doubt.   Plan Swan-Ganz cathether placement to
   asess filling pressures, PCWP, CO/CI.  Also plan Bronchoscopy to assess
   bleeding  infiltrates.
   FEVER -- attributed to UTI (resistent organism).  Plan check new blood,
   sputum, stool cultures.  Add iv and po vanco.
   ANEMIA -- Monitor for bleeding.  Concern for occult GI bleed, alveolar
   hemorrhage.  Would favor maintaining Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing recurrent hypoxemia, oxygen desaturations, and increasing respiratory rate. The patient initially responded well to mask ventilation and intravenous diuretics, but then showed signs of worsening respiratory distress and progressive clinical decline. As a result, urgent intubation was performed, and the patient is now sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of right knee replacement, which was complicated by infection. There is also mention of ongoing fevers attributed to a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a resistant organism. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, and there are concerns for occult gastrointestinal bleeding and alveolar hemorrhage. 

Imaging results show improved chest X-ray with reduced infiltrates, suggesting improvement in pulmonary edema. However, bronchoscopy revealed evidence of alveolar hemorrhage, and a pulmonary artery catheter indicated elevated pulmonary artery pressures consistent with left ventricular heart failure. 

The patient's current conditions and potential complications include respiratory distress with pulmonary edema and possible alveolar hemorrhage, left ventricular heart failure, fever attributed to UTI, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The attending physician plans to continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90%, place a Swan-Ganz catheter to assess filling pressures, perform bronchoscopy to assess bleeding infiltrates, and consult"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- Primary concern is pulmonary edema, possible
   related to volume overload, hypertension with flash pulmonary edema, or
   primary cardiac ischemia.  Chest CT reveals predominately dependent
   infiltrates, but cannot exclude areas of infection.  Other concerns
   include pulmonary hemorrhage/DAH, eosinophilic pneumonia, BOOP, ARDS,
   pyogenic pneumonia, atypical pneumonia or opportunistic infection.
   Resp. failure may also be precipitated by underlying infection, such as
   C. diff, line or wound infection.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg.  Plan for a-line.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- cardiogenic vs. noncardiogenic.  Variable
   radiographic appearance of infiltrates, with interval improvement
   overnight.   However, now with frank bleeding.   Possible aspiration
   (but less likely).  Doubt pulmonary embolism. Other considerations
   include alveolar hemmorrhage (declined Hct), evolving ARDS, infection
   (esp. viral) although doubt.   Plan Swan-Ganz cathether placement to
   asess filling pressures, PCWP, CO/CI.  Also plan Bronchoscopy to assess
   bleeding  infiltrates.
   FEVER -- attributed to UTI (resistent organism).  Plan check new blood,
   sputum, stool cultures.  Add iv and po vanco.
   ANEMIA -- Monitor for bleeding.  Concern for occult GI bleed, alveolar
   hemorrhage.  Would favor maintaining Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck
   coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following
   OSA -- need to better assess, resume CPAP once extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and hemoptysis. They were started on non-invasive ventilation but required urgent intubation due to worsening respiratory distress. The patient has a history of right knee replacement complicated by infection and is on multiple medications including diuretics, antibiotics, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs show fever, elevated heart rate, and low blood pressure. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging reveals dependent infiltrates on chest X-ray, but cannot exclude areas of infection. The patient's condition requires careful management in the ICU, including mechanical ventilation, fluid balance monitoring, and further diagnostic procedures such as bronchoscopy and Swan-Ganz catheter placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging suggest pulmonary edema. This could be due to volume overload, hypertension, or cardiac ischemia.
2. Alveolar hemorrhage: Bronchoscopy findings indicate evidence for alveolar hemorrhage, which can be caused by various factors such as coagulopathy, infection, or vasculitis.
3. Left ventricular heart failure: Elevated pulmonary artery pressures and PCWP suggest left ventricular heart failure, possibly related to ischemia or a stiff ventricle.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- Primary concern is pulmonary edema, possible
   related to volume overload, hypertension with flash pulmonary edema, or
   primary cardiac ischemia.  Chest CT reveals predominately dependent
   infiltrates, but cannot exclude areas of infection.  Other concerns
   include pulmonary hemorrhage/DAH, eosinophilic pneumonia, BOOP, ARDS,
   pyogenic pneumonia, atypical pneumonia or opportunistic infection.
   Resp. failure may also be precipitated by underlying infection, such as
   C. diff, line or wound infection.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg.  Plan for a-line.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- cardiogenic vs. noncardiogenic.  Variable
   radiographic appearance of infiltrates, with interval improvement
   overnight.   However, now with frank bleeding.   Possible aspiration
   (but less likely).  Doubt pulmonary embolism. Other considerations
   include alveolar hemmorrhage (declined Hct), evolving ARDS, infection
   (esp. viral) although doubt.   Plan Swan-Ganz cathether placement to
   asess filling pressures, PCWP, CO/CI.  Also plan Bronchoscopy to assess
   bleeding  infiltrates.
   FEVER -- attributed to UTI (resistent organism).  Plan check new blood,
   sputum, stool cultures.  Add iv and po vanco.
   ANEMIA -- Monitor for bleeding.  Concern for occult GI bleed, alveolar
   hemorrhage.  Would favor maintaining Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck
   coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following
   OSA -- need to better assess, resume CPAP once extubated.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance 1-2 L.  Monitor I/O.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and hemoptysis. The primary concern is pulmonary edema, which could be related to volume overload, hypertension with flash pulmonary edema, or primary cardiac ischemia. Other potential concerns include pulmonary hemorrhage/DAH, eosinophilic pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pyogenic pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, or opportunistic infection. The patient's respiratory failure may also be precipitated by underlying infections such as Clostridium difficile, line or wound infection. The patient is currently mechanically ventilated, and the plan is to continue monitoring ABG levels to maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 > 60 mmHg. A Swan-Ganz catheter placement is planned to assess filling pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac output (CO), and cardiac index (CI). Additionally, a bronchoscopy is planned to assess bleeding infiltrates. 

The patient has a fever attributed to urinary tract infection (UTI) with a resistant organism. New blood, sputum, and stool cultures are planned, and intravenous and oral vancomycin are to be added. Anemia is being monitored for potential bleeding, and the patient's hematocrit (Hct) should be maintained above 27. The patient's rising platelet count suggests ongoing clotting. Rechecking coag"

   Clinical decline since last PM --> recurrent hypoxemia, oxygen
   desaturations, accompanied by increasing RR.
   Good clinical response initally to mask ventilation and iv lasix and
   diuresis overnight.  Some worsening in RR this AM, more resp. distress,
   and progressive clinical decline prompted urgent intubation.  Intubated
   without difficulty, non-truaumatic, but significant bloody return via
   ETT -- red blood.
   Now sedated.  No bleeding elsewhere.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing recurrent hypoxemia, oxygen desaturations, and increasing respiratory rate. The patient initially responded well to mask ventilation and intravenous diuretics but showed worsening respiratory distress and a progressive decline in clinical status, prompting urgent intubation.

The patient was intubated without difficulty, but there was a significant bloody return via the endotracheal tube. The patient is now sedated, and no bleeding elsewhere is noted. The patient is unable to provide a history as they are sedated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient has a history of right knee replacement surgery that was complicated by infection. There are concerns about potential complications such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, eosinophilic pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pyogenic pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, or opportunistic infection. These conditions may be related to volume overload, hypertension with flash pulmonary edema, primary cardiac ischemia, aspiration, alveolar hemorrhage, evolving ARDS, or infection (especially viral).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine level, elevated troponin T level, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. The patient's imaging reveals improved chest X-ray findings with reduced infiltrates.

The assessment and plan include continuing mechanical ventilation,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis, now sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- Primary concern is acute pulmonary edema,
   possible related to intermittent ischemia.  Remains hypoxemic.
   Consider evolving ARDS (at risk).  Resp. failure may also be
   precipitated by underlying infection, such as C. diff, line or wound
   infection.  Continue mechanical venitilation.   Monitor ABG, maintain
   SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- CXR demonstrates continued resolution.  Component of
   pulmonary hemorrhage.  Monitor central filling pressures with
   Swan-Ganz.
   SEPSIS -- Interval development of sepsis (fevers, septic physiology by
   swan ganz).  Recognized UTI (recent), and receiving Rx for right knee
   wound.  However, concern for new additional infection or evolution of
   resistance.  Considerations include pneumonia, C. Diff enteritis,
   abscess/undrained infection.
   FEVER -- attributed in part to UTI (resistent organism), but now
   concern for sepsis.  Await blood, sputum, stool cultures.  Add iv and
   po vanco.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following
   OSA -- Not active issue currently.  Resume CPAP once extubated.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- continue TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they are intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has been experiencing recurrent fevers and has developed hypotension, suggesting sepsis physiology as per the Swan-Ganz catheter findings. 

The patient has several medical conditions that require attention. Firstly, there is concern for acute pulmonary edema, possibly related to intermittent ischemia. The patient remains hypoxemic and may be at risk for evolving ARDS. Mechanical ventilation will continue, and ABG monitoring will be maintained to ensure SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg.

Secondly, the patient has pulmonary edema with CXR demonstrating continued resolution. This is also a component of pulmonary hemorrhage. Central filling pressures will be monitored using the Swan-Ganz catheter.

Thirdly, the patient has developed sepsis, which is characterized by fevers and septic physiology indicated by the Swan-Ganz findings. The initial recognized UTI and treatment for the right knee wound may not have addressed additional infections or evolving resistance. Considerations include pneumonia, C. Diff enteritis, abscess/undrained infection. Blood, sputum, and stool cultures are awaited, and IV and PO vancomycin will be added.

Fourthly, the patient has anemia, which could be attributed to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Elevated PT on loven"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- Primary concern is acute pulmonary edema,
   possible related to intermittent ischemia.  Remains hypoxemic.
   volume overload, hypertension with flash pulmonary edema, or primary
   cardiac ischemia.  Chest CT reveals predominately dependent
   infiltrates, but cannot exclude areas of infection.  Other concerns
   include pulmonary hemorrhage/DAH, eosinophilic pneumonia, BOOP, ARDS,
   pyogenic pneumonia, atypical pneumonia or opportunistic infection.
   Resp. failure may also be precipitated by underlying infection, such as
   C. diff, line or wound infection.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- CXR demonstrates continued resolution.  Component of
   pulmonary hemorrhage.
   Initial cardiogenic vs. noncardiogenic.  Variable radiographic
   appearance of infiltrates, with interval improvement overnight.
   However, now with frank bleeding.   Possible aspiration (but less
   likely).  Doubt pulmonary embolism. Other considerations include
   alveolar hemmorrhage (declined Hct), evolving ARDS, infection (esp.
   viral) although doubt.   Plan Swan-Ganz cathether placement to asess
   filling pressures, PCWP, CO/CI.  Also plan Bronchoscopy to assess
   bleeding  infiltrates.
   SEPSIS -- Interval development of sepsis (fevers, septic physiology by
   swan ganz).  Recognized UTI (recent), and receiving Rx for right knee
   wound.  However, concern for new additional infection or evolution of
   resistance.  Considerations include pneumonia, C. Diff enteritis,
   abscess/undrained infection.
   FEVER -- attributed in part to UTI (resistent organism).  Await blood,
   sputum, stool cultures.  Add iv and po vanco.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following
   OSA -- Not active issue currently.  Resume CPAP once extubated.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient's condition includes recurrent fever, hypotension, and elevated CO with low SVR, indicating sepsis physiology. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with ongoing concerns for acute pulmonary edema, possible pulmonary hemorrhage, eosinophilic pneumonia, ARDS, pyogenic pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, or opportunistic infection. The patient also has a history of right knee replacement complicated by infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's primary concern is acute pulmonary edema, which could be related to intermittent ischemia. There is a possibility of volume overload, hypertension with flash pulmonary edema, or primary cardiac ischemia. Chest CT reveals predominately dependent infiltrates, but cannot exclude areas of infection.
2. Pulmonary Hemorrhage/Distinctive Alveolar Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage, which may be part of the pulmonary edema. The declining Hct suggests alveolar hemorrhage.
3. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a resistant organism. There are concerns for new additional infections or evolution of resistance.
4. Anemia: The patient is experiencing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, elevated PT on Lovenox, and rising platelets. Maintaining Hct >27"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 83 y/o M w/ sepsis and respiratory failure
   .
   # Sepsis: Most likely source is lung given diffuse alveolar hemorrhage,
   but could be systemic response to infxn elsewhere, given negative CT
   abd other sources could include C.diff or knee which was presenting
   symptom on admission to hospital. Appears WBC began decreasing and
   pressor needs decreased w/ addition of vancomycin. Nothing has grown
   from BAL yet. Other source of systemic inflammation could include
   rheumatologic and those studies are still pending.
   - Tap Knee
   - continue vancomycin IV/PO, meropenem
   - Rectal exam for stool for c.diff
   - F/u knee tap culture
   - f/u ID recs
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], antiGBM
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Improving, decreased FIO2 yesterday. Has some
   respiratory acidosis despite large minute ventilation as well as
   failure to respond to metabolic acidosis. Consistent with dead space,
   but doubt PE as has had high cardiac outputs.
   - Low threshold for CTPA if condition does not continue to improve
   - Continue to wean FIO2
   .
   #Acidosis: Metabolic nongap acidosis w/ superimposed respiratory
   acidosis.
   - Volume resuscitation w/ LR to avoid giving more chloride
   .
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks good and plastics thinks that
   wound looks good.
   -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   .
   # CHF: Has diastolic HF, recent ECHO on [**3-28**] showing preserved systolic
   function. Likely decompensated. BNP elevated.
   Repeat echo on [**4-10**] showing mod pulm HTN, mild sym LV hypertrophy,
   minimal AS, and EF 55%.
   -float swan today
   .
   # HTN: Patient's BP has recently been controlled.  Lisinopril increased
   from 10mg to 20mg on [**4-10**].  Pt required small amount of nitro gtt on
   evening of [**4-11**] and now is off.
   - hold  lisinopril, metoprolol, and amlodipine until swan catheter
   placed
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable s/p transfusion
   - follow Hct
   .
   # FEN: Regular low salt diet with fluid restriction. Monitor lytes and
   replete as needed.
   -will check alb

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a diagnosis of sepsis and respiratory failure. The most likely source of sepsis is the lung, but other potential sources include Clostridium difficile (C. diff) or a knee infection. The patient's respiratory failure is improving, with decreased FiO2 requirements. However, there is evidence of dead space and respiratory acidosis. The patient's acid-base status is described as metabolic nongap acidosis with superimposed respiratory acidosis.

The patient has a history of gastrocnemius wound flap surgery, and the wound appears to be healing well. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with preserved systolic function and diastolic dysfunction. The patient's blood pressure is controlled, but there are concerns about fluid overload due to the recent transfusion.

The patient's anemia is stable post-transfusion, and the patient is on a low-salt diet with fluid restriction. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of sepsis, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), fluid overload, worsening of congestive heart failure (CHF), and complications related to the patient's recent surgeries.

   neg S & S eval.  Patient's CXR looks concerning for pulmonary edema,
   and patient's symptoms and hypoxia improved with diuresis the first
   night after admission.  Patient switched to meropenem(since
   [**4-8**])/rifampin ([**3-21**]) on. 1^st night  patient weaned down from NRB  to
   nasal cannula with diuresis/change in antibiotics.  Evening of [**4-13**]
   pt on CPAP with sats 80-90s.  Pt on morning of [**4-10**] desat to 85% and got
   somewhat better with sitting up.   Unclear if pt could have viral PNA,
   DAH, worsening AS, or eosinophilia.  Overnight [**Date range (1) 6753**] RR in 30s to 40s
   was 85% on NRB.   Put on BiPAP rates in upper 20s and 30s and sats in

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent right total knee replacement (TKR) who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) overnight for hypoxia. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Hypoxia: The patient likely has combined CHF and aspiration pneumonia. His symptoms and hypoxia improved with diuresis the first night after admission. The patient was switched to meropenem and rifampin on [**4-8**] and [**3-21**], respectively. He was weaned down from nonrebreather mask (NRB) to a nasal cannula with diuresis/change in antibiotics. In the evening of [**4-13**], the patient was on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with oxygen saturation (sats) in the 80-90s. The patient's sats dropped to 85% and improved somewhat when sitting up. It is unclear if the patient could have viral pneumonia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DAH), worsening aortic stenosis (AS), or eosinophilia. Overnight [**Date range (1) 6753**], the patient's respiratory rate (RR) was in the 30s to 40s and was 85% on NRB. The patient was placed on bi-level positive"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis, now sepsis.
   Evidence for overall clinical improvement over past 24 hrs
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- Primary concern is acute pulmonary edema,
   possible related to intermittent ischemia.  Remains hypoxemic but
   improved.  Consider evolving ARDS (at risk).  Resp. failure may also be
   precipitated by underlying infection, such as C. diff, line or wound
   infection.  Continue mechanical venitilation.   Monitor ABG, maintain
   SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- CXR demonstrates continued resolution, except for .
   Component of pulmonary hemorrhage.  Monitor central filling pressures
   with Swan-Ganz.  Maintain
   SEPSIS -- Interval development of sepsis (fevers, septic physiology by
   swan ganz).  Recognized UTI (recent), and receiving Rx for right knee
   wound.  However, concern for new additional infection or evolution of
   resistance.  Considerations include pneumonia (LUL and LLL on CXR and
   CT scan), C. Diff enteritis, abscess/undrained infection.  Right knee
   tapped today by ortho (+ WBC) --> await culture results.  Continue
   empirical antimicrobials.
   FEVER -- attributed in part to UTI (resistent organism), but now
   concern for sepsis.  Await blood, sputum, stool cultures.  Continue
   Meripenem,Vancomycin, Rifampin, PO vanco (possible C. diff).
   ACIDOSIS -- appears predmoniately elevated dead space ventilation.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service performed right knee arthrocentesis.
   OSA -- Not active issue currently.  Resume CPAP once extubated.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- continue TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. Vasopressor requirement is variable, currently off. Swan Ganz readings are improving/normalizing. The patient has a history of recent right knee replacement surgery, complicated by infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute pulmonary edema, possible related to intermittent ischemia. This may lead to hypoxemia and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis, possibly due to underlying infections such as C. diff, line or wound infection. There is a concern for new additional infection or evolution of resistance.
3. Pulmonary hemorrhage: There is a component of pulmonary hemorrhage seen on the CXR. Monitoring central filling pressures with Swan-Ganz and maintaining adequate oxygenation is essential.
4. Acidosis: The patient appears to have predominate elevated dead space ventilation, which may contribute to metabolic acidosis.
5. Anemia: The patient has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and elevated PT on lovenox. Maintaining Hct >27 is crucial.
6. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels and needs repletion.
7. Malnutrition: The patient requires nutritional support due to their critical condition.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Sepsis: Most likely source is lung given diffuse alveolar hemorrhage,
   but could be systemic response to infxn elsewhere, given negative CT
   abd other sources could include C.diff or knee which was presenting
   symptom on admission to hospital. Appears WBC began decreasing and
   pressor needs decreased w/ addition of vancomycin. Nothing has grown
   from BAL yet. Other source of systemic inflammation could include
   rheumatologic and those studies are still pending.  WBC trending up
   today but still no organism has been ID.

   # Respiratory failure: Improving, decreased FIO2 yesterday. Has some
   respiratory acidosis despite large minute ventilation as well as
   failure to respond to metabolic acidosis. Consistent with dead space,
   but doubt PE as has had high cardiac outputs.
   - Low threshold for CTPA if condition does not continue to improve
   - Continue to wean FIO2
   .
   #Acidosis: Metabolic nongap acidosis w/ superimposed respiratory
   acidosis.
   - Volume resuscitation w/ LR to avoid giving more chloride
   .
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks good and plastics thinks that
   wound looks good.
   -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   .
   # CHF: Has diastolic HF, recent ECHO on [**3-28**] showing preserved systolic
   function. Likely decompensated. BNP elevated.
   Repeat echo on [**4-10**] showing mod pulm HTN, mild sym LV hypertrophy,
   minimal AS, and EF 55%.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure, and septic joint after undergoing right total knee replacement. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia and required intubation due to suspected septic physiology.

The patient's 24-hour events include a tap of the knee showing 13,000 WBC, 35,000 RBC, with no organisms on gram stain. No infectious source was found, and he was started on lactated Ringer's (LR) as fluid. His WBC count is trending down, but he remains acidotic on ABGs, requiring supplemental oxygen at 6L and a pilot balloon leak. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and has received various antibiotics including rifampin, meropenem, and vancomycin. He is currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and norepinephrine infusions. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/52-137/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Sepsis: Most likely source is lung given diffuse alveolar hemorrhage,
   but could be systemic response to infxn elsewhere, given negative CT
   abd other sources could include C.diff or knee which was presenting
   symptom on admission to hospital. Appears WBC began decreasing and
   pressor needs decreased w/ addition of vancomycin. Nothing has grown
   from BAL yet. Other source of systemic inflammation could include
   rheumatologic and those studies are still pending.  WBC trending up
   today but still no organism has been ID.
   - f/u knee tap cx
   - continue vancomycin IV/PO, meropenem, & rifampin
   - f/u ID recs
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], antiGBM (pulmonary renal labs given DAH)
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Pt has a metabolic acidosis without appropriate
   respiratory compensation.  He has some respiratory acidosis despite
   large minute ventilation as well as failure to respond to metabolic
   acidosis. This is consistent with dead space.  The patient could also
   be developing an ARDS like picture.
   -will decrease FiO2.
   -will try to increase RR in order to help pt blow off acid.  Also would
   be good for pt to decrease tidal volume.  Will increase sedation in
   order to achieve this if needed will add propofol.
   -f/u BAL
   .
   #Acidosis: Metabolic nongap acidosis w/ superimposed respiratory
   acidosis.
   - Volume resuscitation w/ LR to avoid giving more chloride
   .
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks good and plastics thinks that
   wound looks good.
   -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   -f.u knee tap
   .
   # CHF: Has diastolic HF, recent ECHO on [**3-28**] showing preserved systolic
   function. Likely decompensated. BNP elevated.
   Repeat echo on [**4-10**] showing mod pulm HTN, mild sym LV hypertrophy,
   minimal AS, and EF 55%.
   -will remove swan today
   .
   # HTN: Holding all BP meds given pt requiring levophed today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable
   - follow Hct
   .
   # FEN: Regular low salt diet with fluid restriction. Monitor lytes and
   replete as needed.
   -will check alb
   .
   # Access: given need for levophed, sedation, and possibly paralytic in
   the future will need more access.   Will insert triple lumen inside of
   cordis. Also try to get peripheral IV.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure, and septic joint following a right total knee replacement. The patient was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia and required intubation due to suspected septic physiology.

The patient's 24-hour events include a tap of the knee with 13,000 WBC, 35,000 RBC, and no organisms on gram stain. No infectious source was found, and the patient started with lactated Ringer's (LR) as fluid. The WBC count is trending down, but the patient remains acidotic on arterial blood gases (ABGs). There is also a pilot balloon leak.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, norepinephrine, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/52 mmHg to 137/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of 49/24 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 18 mmHg, cardiac output"

   concern remains for component of acute pulmonary edema, possible
   related to intermittent ischemia, in combination with AS and MR.
   Hypoxemia improved.   Continue mechanical venitilation.   Monitor ABG,
   maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg.

   resistance.  Considerations include pneumonia (LUL and LLL on CXR and
   CT scan), C. Diff enteritis, abscess/undrained infection.  Right knee
   tapped by ortho (+ WBC) --> await culture results.  Continue empirical
   antimicrobials.
   FEVER -- attributed in part to UTI (resistent organism), but now
   concern for sepsis.  Await blood, sputum, stool cultures.  Continue

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis, and now sepsis. There is evidence of continued overall gradual clinical improvement over the past 24 hours. The patient has alveolar hemorrhage attributed to left upper lobe (LUL) and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. There is concern for pulmonary-renal syndrome, although it is improving without specific therapy. Underlying concern remains for acute pulmonary edema, possible related to intermittent ischemia, in combination with aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient's hypoxemia has improved, and they will continue with mechanical ventilation. ABG and SaO2 levels will be monitored to maintain them above 90% or pO2 above 60 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has respiratory distress due to alveolar hemorrhage attributed to LUL and LLL pneumonia. There is concern for pulmonary-renal syndrome and acute pulmonary edema. Monitoring central filling pressures with a Swan-Ganz catheter and maintaining oxygenation are necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient is recognized to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is receiving antibiotics for a right knee wound. However, there is concern for new additional infection or evolution of resistance. Pneumonia, Clostridium difficile enteritis, abscess/undrained infection, and right knee infection are possible considerations. Continuing empirical antimicrobials and awaiting blood, sputum, stool cultures are planned.
3. Fever: The patient has fever attributed in part to UTI but now concerns sepsis. Blood, sputum, and stool cultures have been sent. Continuing Meropenem, Vancomycin, Rifampin, and PO Vancomycin (possible C. difficile) is planned.
4. Acidosis: The patient appears predominantly elevated dead space ventilation. Monitoring and maintaining a goal pH above 7.20 is necessary.
5. Anemia: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and elevated PT on lovenox have caused anemia. Maintaining Hct above 27 and rechecking coags (PT/PT) are important.
6. Right Knee Replacement Complications: The patient's right knee replacement is complicated by infection. Continuing antimicrobials and ortho service performed right knee arthrocentesis are planned.
7. OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea): Although not currently an active issue while intubated, it is worth monitoring.
8. Fluids: The patient is currently hypovolemic, desiring a net positive fluid balance, and will be monitored with central venous pressure (CVP).
9. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels have been repleted to K>4.0.
10. Nutritional Support: The patient will continue total parenteral nutrition (TF). Consider"

   Respiratory failulre, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis, now sepsis.
   Evidence for continued overall gradual clinical improvement over past
   24 hrs, although remains critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Alveolar hemorrhage attributed to LUL and LLL
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 51**] be evolving ARDS.  Alveolar hemorrhage raises concern
   for pulmonary-renal syndrome, although improving without benefit of
   specific therapy
 awaiting blood testing (including ANCA).  Underlying
   concern remains for component of acute pulmonary edema, possible
   related to intermittent ischemia, in combination with AS and MR.
   Hypoxemia improved.   Continue mechanical venitilation.   Monitor ABG,
   maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- CXR demonstrates continued resolution, except for .
   Component of pulmonary hemorrhage.  Monitor central filling pressures
   with Swan-Ganz.  Maintain
   SEPSIS -- Recognized UTI (recent), and receiving Rx for right knee
   wound.  However, concern for new additional infection or evolution of
   resistance.  Considerations include pneumonia (LUL and LLL on CXR and
   CT scan), C. Diff enteritis, abscess/undrained infection.  Right knee
   tapped by ortho (+ WBC) --> await culture results.  Continue empirical
   antimicrobials.
   FEVER -- attributed in part to UTI (resistent organism), but now
   concern for sepsis.  Await blood, sputum, stool cultures.  Continue
   Meripenem,Vancomycin, Rifampin, PO vanco (possible C. diff).  Plan to
   d/c swan
   ACIDOSIS -- appears predmoniately elevated dead space ventilation.
   Monitor, goa pH>7.20
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service performed right knee arthrocentesis.
   OSA -- Not active issue currently while intubated.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- continue TF.  Consider TPN per surgery, but
   primary concern is high risk for fungal infectious complication.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and hemoptysis due to left upper lobe (LUL) and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. There is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and alveolar hemorrhage raises suspicion for pulmonary-renal syndrome. The underlying concern also includes acute pulmonary edema, possibly related to intermittent ischemia in combination with aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR).

The patient's hypoxemia has improved, but they remain critically ill. Mechanical ventilation will continue, and ABG monitoring will be maintained to keep SaO2 above 90% or pO2 above 60 mmHg.

Pulmonary edema is resolving except for a component of pulmonary hemorrhage. Central filling pressures will be monitored with a Swan-Ganz catheter, and efforts will be made to maintain these pressures.

Sepsis is recognized as a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is resistant to antibiotics, and there is concern for additional infections or evolution of resistance. Pneumonia, Clostridium difficile enteritis, abscess/undrained infection, and right knee infection are possible considerations. Blood, sputum, and stool cultures will be awaited, and empirical antimicrobials will be continued.

Fever is attributed in part to the UTI but now raises concern for sepsis. Blood, sputum, and stool cultures will"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Sepsis: Most likely source is lung given diffuse alveolar hemorrhage,
   but could be systemic response to infxn elsewhere, given negative CT
   abd other sources could include C.diff or knee which was presenting
   symptom on admission to hospital. Appears WBC began decreasing and
   pressor needs decreased w/ addition of vancomycin. Nothing has grown
   from BAL yet. Other source of systemic inflammation could include
   rheumatologic and those studies are still pending.  WBC trending up
   today but still no organism has been ID.
   - f/u knee tap cx
   - continue vancomycin IV/PO, meropenem, & rifampin
   - f/u ID recs
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], antiGBM (pulmonary renal labs given DAH)
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Pt has a metabolic acidosis without appropriate
   respiratory compensation.  He has some respiratory acidosis despite
   large minute ventilation as well as failure to respond to metabolic
   acidosis. This is consistent with dead space.  The patient could also
   be developing an ARDS like picture.
   -will decrease FiO2.
   -will try to increase RR in order to help pt blow off acid.  Also would
   be good for pt to decrease tidal volume.  Will increase sedation in
   order to achieve this if needed will add propofol.
   -f/u BAL
   .
   #Acidosis: Metabolic nongap acidosis w/ superimposed respiratory
   acidosis.
   - Volume resuscitation w/ LR to avoid giving more chloride
   .
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks good and plastics thinks that
   wound looks good.
   -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   -f.u knee tap
   .
   # CHF: Has diastolic HF, recent ECHO on [**3-28**] showing preserved systolic
   function. Likely decompensated. BNP elevated.
   Repeat echo on [**4-10**] showing mod pulm HTN, mild sym LV hypertrophy,
   minimal AS, and EF 55%.
   -will remove swan today

   # HTN: Holding all BP meds given pt requiring levophed today.

   # Anemia: Hct stable
   - follow Hct

   # FEN: Regular low salt diet with fluid restriction. Monitor lytes and
   replete as needed.
   -will check alb

   # Access: given need for levophed, sedation, and possibly paralytic in
   the future will need more access.   Will insert triple lumen inside of
   cordis. Also try to get peripheral IV.

","The patient's current medical condition is as follows:
- The patient has sepsis, with the most likely source being the lung due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. However, other sources such as C. difficile or the knee infection could also be contributing to the systemic response.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is indicated by metabolic acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation. There is also a failure to respond to metabolic acidosis, suggesting dead space. The patient may be developing an ARDS-like picture.
- The patient has metabolic nongap acidosis with superimposed respiratory acidosis.
- The patient has diastolic heart failure, as evidenced by a recent echo showing preserved systolic function. Decompensated heart failure is likely, given the elevated BNP levels. Another echo on 04-10 showed moderate pulmonary hypertension, mild symmetric LV hypertrophy, minimal AS, and an EF of 55%.
- The patient has hypertension, which is currently being managed with norepinephrine.
- The patient has anemia, but the Hct is stable.
- The patient requires renal monitoring, including electrolyte levels and fluid restriction.
- The patient's nutritional needs should be addressed, and glycemic control should be maintained.
- The patient requires additional vascular access due to the need for norepinephrine, sedation, and possible paralysis in the future. A triple lumen inside the cordis will be inserted, along with attempts to obtain a peripheral IV"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ sepsis and ARDS
   # Sepsis: Consider C.diff sepsis given ileus, have not had stool to
   send for toxin. On pressors to increase SVR. ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti
   GBM pending. Blood cultures, respiratory studies from BAL have been
   negative to date. Also consider fungal etiology.
   - consider empiric fungal coverage
   - consider PR vancomycin
   - continue IV vancomycin
   - continue meropenem day 8
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Large dead space ventilation w/ respiratory
   acidosis on top of metabolic acidosis. Most likely c/w ARDS.
   - Decrease dead space in vent tubing
   - consider paralysis if vent dysynchrony is significantly contributing
   to poor ventilation
   -will decrease FiO2.
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   -f/u BAL final legionella and AFB culture.
   .
   #Acidosis: Metabolic nongap acidosis w/ superimposed respiratory
   acidosis. Doubt that bicarbonate would improve as would increase CO2
   which is not being exhaled.
   - Volume resuscitation if necessary will use  LR to avoid giving more
   chloride
   .
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks good, and knee tap essentially
   negative
   -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   -f.u knee tap Cx
   .
   # CHF: Unknown why he decompensated on the floor,
   .
   # HTN: Holding all BP meds given pt requiring levophed today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable
   - follow Hct
   .
   # FEN: Regular low salt diet with fluid restriction. Monitor lytes and
   replete as needed.
   -will check alb
   .
   # Access: given need for levophed, sedation, and possibly paralytic in
   the future will need more access.   Will insert triple lumen inside of
   cordis. Also try to get peripheral IV.
   .
   # PPX: continue SC lovenox  PPI, bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. There is concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, given the presence of ileus and the absence of stool to send for toxin. Blood cultures, respiratory studies from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and ANCA tests have been negative, but anti-GBM pending. Fungal etiology is also being considered. 

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to large dead space ventilation with respiratory acidosis on top of metabolic acidosis, which is consistent with ARDS. Measures to decrease dead space in the vent tubing, consider paralysis if vent dysynchrony is significantly contributing to poor ventilation, decrease FiO2, and use a lung-protective strategy with small tidal volumes and high frequency respiratory rates are being implemented.

The patient has metabolic nongap acidosis with superimposed respiratory acidosis, and it is doubtful that bicarbonate administration would improve the situation as it would increase CO2 which is not being exhaled. Volume resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (LR) is planned to avoid giving more chloride.

The patient has a history of gastrocnemius muscle flap surgery, and the wound looks good"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis, now sepsis.
   Evidence for overall clinical decline over past 24 hrs, primary problem
   now acidosis which appears to be predmonately respiratory.   Remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxemia, attributed to
   LUL and LLL pneumonia, now ARDS.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg using lung protective
   strategy.  Significant alveolar hypoventilation --> may need to
   paralyze.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- Cardiogenic component improved.  Now with evidence
   for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema --> lung protective strategy.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, distributive shock.  Maintain
   SEPSIS -- Unclear source, but concerns includ pneumonia, UTI (recent),
   and right knee wound.  No other new additional infection identified.
   Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   FEVER -- low grade.  Attributed to sepsis.  Await blood, sputum, stool
   cultures.  Continue Meripenem,Vancomycin, Rifampin, iv Flagyl and PO
   vanco (possible C. diff).  Check serum b-glucan, galactomannan.
   ACIDOSIS -- appears predmoniately elevated dead space ventilation.
   Monitor, goal pH>7.20.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- continue TF.  Consider TPN per surgery, but
   primary concern is high risk for fungal infectious complication while
   septic, intubated and on broad spectrum antimicrobials.
   OSA -- Not active issue currently while intubated.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and sepsis. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxemia, and ARDS. Mechanical ventilation will be continued to maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg using a lung protective strategy. There may be a need for paralysis due to significant alveolar hypoventilation.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. A lung protective strategy will be maintained.

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension attributed to sepsis and distributive shock. It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is unclear in source, but concerns include pneumonia, UTI (recent), and right knee wound. Empirical antimicrobials will be continued, and blood, sputum, stool cultures will be awaited. Serum b-glucan and galactomannan tests will be checked.

5. Acidosis: The patient has predominate elevated dead space ventilation leading to acidosis. Monitoring and goal pH > 7.20 will be maintained.

6. Anemia: The patient has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, elevated PT on lovenox, and rising plts. The goal is to maintain Hct"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis, now sepsis.
   Evidence for overall clinical decline over past 24 hrs, primary problem
   now acidosis which appears to be predmonately respiratory.   Remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxemia, attributed to
   LUL and LLL pneumonia, now ARDS.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg using lung protective
   strategy.  Significant alveolar hypoventilation --> may need to
   paralyze.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- Cardiogenic component improved.  Now with evidence
   for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema --> lung protective strategy.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, distributive shock.  Maintain
   SEPSIS -- Unclear source, but concerns includ pneumonia, UTI (recent),
   and right knee wound.  No other new additional infection identified.
   Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   FEVER -- low grade.  Attributed to sepsis.  Await blood, sputum, stool
   cultures.  Continue Meripenem,Vancomycin, Rifampin, iv Flagyl and PO
   vanco (possible C. diff).  Check serum b-glucan, galactomannan.
   ACIDOSIS -- appears predmoniately elevated dead space ventilation.
   Monitor, goal pH>7.20.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- continue TF.  Consider TPN per surgery, but
   primary concern is high risk for fungal infectious complication while
   septic, intubated and on broad spectrum antimicrobials.
   OSA -- Not active issue currently while intubated.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, hypotension, sepsis, fever, acidosis, anemia, and hypokalemia. The patient underwent a right knee replacement surgery but developed an infection. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxemia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This requires continuous mechanical ventilation with a lung-protective strategy to maintain oxygenation and prevent further lung injury.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which needs to be managed along with the ARDS.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension due to septic shock. This needs to be managed with appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
4. Sepsis: The patient is septic, and the source of infection is unclear. Possible sources include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or the right knee wound. Empirical antimicrobials should be continued, and cultures should be monitored for any signs of infection.
5. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever attributed to sepsis. Blood, sputum, and stool cultures should be obtained to identify the source of infection.
6. Acidosis: The patient has acidosis primarily due to elevated dead space ventilation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) in the ICU. The patient has been on ventilatory support and has shown some improvement in acidosis without the need for paralysis. The patient's line has been changed, and IV flagyl has been started in case of c.diff ileus. The patient's CVP (central venous pressure) is within the normal range of 5-8 mmHg, and pressors have been weaned. Total fluids in and out are balanced, with adequate urine output. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/55 to 80/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and a temperature of 36.5°C. The patient's lungs are clear, and there is no mention of any new abnormalities in the physical examination.

Laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count of 20.0 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 152,000/microL, and normal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with sepsis and ARDS. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/55 to 80/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 100.9 kg, and height is 73 inches.

The patient has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, azithromycin, meropenem, metronidazole, midazolam, norepinephrine, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. The patient also has a history of allergies to no known drugs.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly low potassium levels.

The patient's physical examination findings include sedation on the ventilator, abrasions on the cheeks, distant heart sounds, clear lungs anteriorly, soft abdomen with no tenderness, and bilateral 2+ pitting edema.

The patient's arterial blood gas results indicate respiratory acidosis on top of metabolic acidosis. The patient's ABG values are pH 7.29, PaCO2 44, HCO3- 78, SaO2 92%, and FiO2 50%. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 501 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O.

The patient's assessment and plan include considering Clostridium difficile sepsis given ileus, continuing IV vancomycin, meropenem on day 8, empiric fungal coverage, PR vancomycin, and decreasing FiO2. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS with large dead space ventilation and respiratory acidosis. The plan includes decreasing dead space in vent tubing, considering paralysis for vent dysynchrony, and continuing small TV with high frequency RR as a lung protective strategy.

The patient's metabolic nongap acidosis with superimposed respiratory acidosis is being monitored, and volume resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution is planned if necessary. The patient's gastroc wound flap is doing well, and routine post-op care is being provided. The patient's CHF, HTN, anemia, FEN, access, PPX, code, and disposition are also addressed in the plan.

The patient's nutrition is being provided through a pulmonary diet, and glycemic control is being maintained. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line, multi-lumen"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with sepsis and ARDS. The patient's condition appears to be improving, with improvements in acidosis, decreased dysynchrony, and better synchrony with ventilation. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient is still considered to have sepsis, although improving. There is a concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis due to ileus and the absence of stool for toxin testing. Continuous monitoring for any signs of worsening sepsis is necessary.

2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS is also improving, but the repeat chest X-ray shows large dead space ventilation with respiratory acidosis on top of metabolic acidosis. This indicates ongoing respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation, and blood gases is essential to ensure adequate lung function and prevent further deterioration.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic nongap acidosis with superimposed respiratory acidosis. Bicarbonate therapy may not be beneficial as it could increase CO2 levels, which are already elevated. Volume resuscitation may be necessary if indicated, using lactated Ringer's (LR) solution to avoid excessive chloride administration.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is steadily dropping, indicating anemia. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) is recommended"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been improving, but there are ongoing concerns regarding respiratory failure, acidosis, CHF, hypertension, anemia, fluid electrolyte balance, and access for medications. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed properly.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure is consistent with ARDS, a life-threatening lung condition that requires careful management of ventilation and oxygenation.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis with a superimposed respiratory acidosis. Close monitoring and management of acid-base balance is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient's decompensation on the floor may be related to an underlying CHF condition. Proper management of fluid balance and cardiac function is crucial.
5. Hypotension: The patient requires low-dose pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure, indicating potential issues with vascular resistance and perfusion.
6. Anemia: Although the patient's Hct is stable, monitoring and management of anemia is important to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ sepsis and ARDS
   # Sepsis:  Improving.  Afebrile for 24hrs.   Consider C.diff sepsis
   given ileus, have not had stool to send for toxin. Low dose pressors to
   increase SVR. ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti GBM negative.  Blood cultures,
   respiratory studies from BAL have been negative to date.   Patient has
   been improving on current antibiotic regimen and has been able to
   tolerate very low dose of levophed.
   - Continue Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]/Flagyl/Azithromycin
   - Follow up cx (Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma)
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   # ARDS:   Improving.  Patient
s repeat CXR shows interval improvement
   in infiltrates.  Patient
s metabolic acidosis is improving, pH is
   around 7.3, likely from change in I/E ratio and from change in tube.
   Patient still overbreathing ventilator, and would likely benefit from
   increased sedation.  No indication for paralysis at this time as
   patient is clinically improving.
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - Increase sedation
   #Acidosis:  pH is 7.29 this AM.  Metabolic nongap acidosis w/
   superimposed respiratory acidosis. Doubt that bicarbonate would improve
   as would increase CO2 which is not being exhaled.
   - Volume resuscitation if necessary will use  LR to avoid giving more
   chloride
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks good, and knee tap essentially
   negative
   -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   -f.u knee tap Cx
   # HTN: Holding all BP meds given as pt requiring levophed.
   # Anemia: Hct steadily dropping.
   -          Transfuse 1 unit PRBCs today.
   -          Check post transfusion HCT
   .
   # FEN: Regular low salt diet.  Na 148 this AM, increased tube flushes
   to 250cc.
   -will check alb
   .
   # Access: given need for levophed, sedation, and possibly paralytic in
   the future will need more access.   Will insert triple lumen inside of
   cordis. Also try to get peripheral IV.

   # PPX: continue SC lovenox  PPI, bowel regimen increased.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis and ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The patient's condition has been improving over the past 24 hours with changes in vent settings, increased RR (respiratory rate) and decreased Vt (tidal volume), leading to improved acidosis and decreased dysynchrony. The patient's CVP (Central Venous Pressure) is within the normal range of 5-8 mmHg, and the pressors have been weaned off.

The patient's allergies are noted as no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin at 08:20 AM on 04/15/2188, Azithromycin at 01:52 PM on 04/15/2188, Meropenem at 02:00 AM on 04/16/2188, and Metronidazole at 04:00 AM on 04/16/2188.

The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 2 mg/hour, norepinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min, and fentanyl at 150 mcg/hour. Other medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) and midazolam (Versed) as well.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5°C,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis and ARDS. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/55 to 143/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 501 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance of 50.1 cmH2O/mL.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and ARDS. The sepsis is improving, with the patient being afebrile for 24 hours. However, there is a concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis due to ileus. Blood cultures and respiratory studies from bronchoalveolar lavage have been negative to date.

For ARDS, the patient's condition is also improving, with interval improvement in infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's metabolic acidosis is improving, with a pH around 7.3. The patient is still overbreathing the ventilator, and measures are being taken to decrease dead space in the vent tubing and consider paralysis if ventilator dysynchrony is significantly contributing to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, sepsis,ARDS, now with continued clinical
   improvement, although remains critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxemia, attributed to
   LUL and LLL pneumonia, now ARDS.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg using lung protective
   strategy.  Marked improvement in alveolar ventilation.  Repeat CXR
   (poor quality film this AM).
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- Cardiogenic component improved.  Now with evidence
   for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema --> lung protective strategy.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, distributive shock.  Maintain
   vasopressor, wean as tolerated to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- Unclear source, but concerns include pneumonia, UTI (recent),
   and right knee wound.  No other new additional infection identified.
   Continue empirical antimicrobials, including Azithro and Flagyl.
   FEVER -- resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Continue
   Meripenem,Vancomycin, Rifampin, iv Flagyl and PO vanco (possible C.
   diff).  Check serum b-glucan, galactomannan.
   ACIDOSIS -- appears predmoniately elevated dead space ventilation.
   Monitor, goal pH>7.20.  Now improved.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- tolerating; continue TF --> advance to goal
   rate.
   OSA -- Not active issue currently while intubated.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, sepsis,ARDS, now with continued clinical
   improvement, although remains critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxemia, attributed to
   LUL and LLL pneumonia, now ARDS.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg using lung protective
   strategy.  Marked improvement in alveolar ventilation.  Repeat CXR
   (poor quality film this AM).
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- Cardiogenic component improved.  Now with evidence
   for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema --> lung protective strategy.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, distributive shock.  Maintain
   vasopressor, wean as tolerated to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- Unclear source, but concerns include pneumonia, UTI (recent),
   and right knee wound.  No other new additional infection identified.
   Continue empirical antimicrobials, including Azithro and Flagyl.
   FEVER -- resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Continue
   Meripenem,Vancomycin, Rifampin, iv Flagyl and PO vanco (possible C.
   diff).  Check serum b-glucan, galactomannan.
   ACIDOSIS -- appears predmoniately elevated dead space ventilation.
   Monitor, goal pH>7.20.  Now improved.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- tolerating; continue TF --> advance to goal
   rate.
   OSA -- Not active issue currently while intubated.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. There have been improvements in the patient's condition, including the exchange of endotracheal tube (ETT), weaning off vasopressor, decline in white blood cell count (WBC), and improvement in renal function. The patient is tolerating tube feeds (TF) and is being advanced to reach their nutritional goal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has continued clinical improvement, but remains critically ill with respiratory distress. They continue to require mechanical ventilation, and their ABG should be monitored. Lung protective strategies should be implemented to maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient initially had cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but now shows evidence of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Lung protective strategies should be continued.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis and distributive shock. Vasopressor support should be maintained to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg, with gradual weaning as tolerated.

4. Sepsis: The source of sepsis is unclear, but concerns include pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and a right knee wound. Empirical antimicrobials"

s metabolic acidosis is improving, pH is
   around 7.3, likely from change in I/E ratio and from change in tube.
   Patient still overbreathing ventilator, and would likely benefit from
   increased sedation.  No indication for paralysis at this time as
   patient is clinically improving.
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - Increase sedation
   #Acidosis:  pH is 7.29 this AM.  Metabolic nongap acidosis w/
   superimposed respiratory acidosis. Doubt that bicarbonate would improve
   as would increase CO2 which is not being exhaled.
   - Volume resuscitation if necessary will use  LR to avoid giving more

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, sepsis,ARDS, now with continued clinical
   improvement, although remains critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxemia, attributed to
   LUL and LLL pneumonia, now ARDS.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg using lung protective
   strategy.  Marked improvement in alveolar ventilation.   Consider
   repeat bronchoscopy if lack of continued progress or serum
   galactomannan or b-glucan detected.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- Cardiogenic component improved.  Now with evidence
   for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS) --> lung protective
   strategy.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, distributive shock.  Maintain
   vasopressor, wean as tolerated to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- Unclear source, but concerns include pneumonia, UTI (recent),
   and right knee wound.  No other new additional infection identified.
   Continue empirical antimicrobials, including Azithro and Flagyl.
   FEVER -- resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Continue
   Meripenem,Vancomycin, Rifampin, iv Flagyl and PO vanco (possible C.
   diff).  Check serum b-glucan, galactomannan.
   ACIDOSIS -- appears predmoniately elevated dead space ventilation.
   Monitor, goal pH>7.20.  Now improved.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- tolerating; continue TF --> advance to goal
   rate.
   OSA -- Not active issue currently while intubated.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, sepsis, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). They are intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but they have a history of hypotension, fever, acidosis, anemia, and hypokalemia. They have been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and ARDS, which can lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or lung infections due to impaired lung function.
2. Sepsis and Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis, and there is a concern about the source of infection. This could potentially lead to worsening sepsis or the development of new infections.
3. Cardiac Issues: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS) has been observed, indicating potential cardiac involvement. Monitoring for any signs of cardiogenic shock or heart failure is essential.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable with the help of vasopressors, but close monitoring is required to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) and prevent hypotension.
5. Nutritional Support: The patient is tolerating tube feeding and needs to be monitored for any signs of intolerance or complications related to nutrition support.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, sepsis,ARDS, now with continued clinical
   improvement, although remains critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxemia, attributed to
   LUL and LLL pneumonia, now ARDS.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg using lung protective
   strategy.  Marked improvement in alveolar ventilation.  Repeat CXR
   (poor quality film this AM).
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- Cardiogenic component improved.  Now with evidence
   for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS) --> lung protective
   strategy.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, distributive shock.  Maintain
   vasopressor, wean as tolerated to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- Unclear source, but concerns include pneumonia, UTI (recent),
   and right knee wound.  No other new additional infection identified.
   Continue empirical antimicrobials, including Azithro and Flagyl.
   FEVER -- resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Continue
   Meripenem,Vancomycin, Rifampin, iv Flagyl and PO vanco (possible C.
   diff).  Check serum b-glucan, galactomannan.
   ACIDOSIS -- appears predmoniately elevated dead space ventilation.
   Monitor, goal pH>7.20.  Now improved.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- tolerating; continue TF --> advance to goal
   rate.
   OSA -- Not active issue currently while intubated.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They also have hypotension, likely due to sepsis, and an elevated lactate level indicating poor tissue perfusion. The patient has a fever that has now resolved, as well as anemia and thrombocytopenia. There is concern for an infection in the right knee, which may have been a source of sepsis. The patient's acid-base balance is also affected, with a predominately elevated dead space ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, which has progressed to ARDS. This condition can lead to further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or lung abscess.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
3. ARDS: The patient's ARDS can progress to acute respiratory failure, requiring increased ventilatory support or extracorporeal life support.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection in the right knee: If left untreated, this infection could spread and become a source of ongoing sepsis.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: Prol"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis and ARDS. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/42 mmHg to 137/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Azithromycin, Meropenem, and Metronidazole. They are also receiving sedation with midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal potassium and sodium levels. Other lab results are within normal range or do not show significant abnormalities.

The patient's CVP has decreased, and a LR bolus of 500cc will be given. Pressors will be weaned as tolerated. The patient's ARDS is improving, as shown by the repeat CXR which shows interval improvement in infiltrates in the left upper and lower lobes. The patient's metabolic acidosis is improving, and the pH is around 7.31.

The patient's gastroc wound flap looks good, and the knee tap essentially negative. Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team will be followed.

   Blood cultures, respiratory studies from BAL have been negative to
   date.   Patient has been improving on current antibiotic regimen and
   has been able to tolerate very low dose of levophed.
   - Continue Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]/Flagyl/Azithromycin d/c vanc/meropenem on [**4-21**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Follow up cx (Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma)
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Wean PEEP if O2 tolerates
   # ARDS: Appears that oxygenation is not improving. PO2 dropping on same
   settings.
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - continue current level of sedation
   -continue FiO2 50%

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, sepsis,ARDS, now with continued clinical
   improvement, although remains critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxemia, attributed to
   LUL and LLL pneumonia, now ARDS.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg using lung protective
   strategy.  Consider repeat bronchoscopy if lack of continued progress
   or serum galactomannan or b-glucan detected.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- Cardiogenic component improved.  Now with evidence
   for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS) --> lung protective
   strategy.  Hope to begin net diuresis to limit lung water.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, distributive shock --> resolving.
   Hope to continue to wean vasopressor (may be related to
   sedation/analgesia), wean as tolerated to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- Unclear source, but concerns include pneumonia, UTI (recent),
   and right knee wound.  No other new additional infection identified.
   Continue empirical antimicrobials, including Azithro and Flagyl.
   FEVER -- resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Continue
   Meripenem,Vancomycin, Rifampin, iv Flagyl and PO vanco (possible C.
   diff).  Serum b-glucan and galactomannan both negative (fungal
   infection less likely).
   ACIDOSIS -- appears predmoniately elevated dead space ventilation.
   Monitor, goal pH>7.20.  Now improved.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- improved.  Continue free H2O.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- tolerating; continue TF --> advance to goal
   rate.
   OSA -- Not active issue currently while intubated.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have been diagnosed with respiratory failure, sepsis, and ARDS. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/45 to 133/60 mmHg, respiratory rate at 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to experience high residuals with TF (likely referring to a feeding tube) and is on hold despite active bowel sounds and a benign abdomen. This may indicate ongoing respiratory distress or issues with gastrointestinal motility.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia in the left upper lobe (LUL) and left lower lobe (LLL), which has progressed to ARDS. The patient will continue to be mechanically ventilated, and efforts will be made to maintain oxygenation levels above 90%.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS), and a lung protective strategy will be implemented. Net diuresis may be considered to limit lung water.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, attributed to sepsis and distributive shock. Vasopressors are being weaned as tolerated to maintain mean"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failulre, sepsis,ARDS, now with continued clinical
   improvement, although remains critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxemia, attributed to
   LUL and LLL pneumonia, now ARDS.  Continue mechanical venitilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 > 90% or pO2 >60 mmHg using lung protective
   strategy.  Consider repeat bronchoscopy if lack of continued progress
   or serum galactomannan or b-glucan detected.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- Cardiogenic component improved.  Now with evidence
   for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS) --> lung protective
   strategy.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, distributive shock --> resolving.
   Hope to continue to wean vasopressor (may be related to
   sedation/analgesia), wean as tolerated to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- Unclear source, but concerns include pneumonia, UTI (recent),
   and right knee wound.  No other new additional infection identified.
   Continue empirical antimicrobials, including Azithro and Flagyl.
   FEVER -- resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Continue
   Meripenem,Vancomycin, Rifampin, iv Flagyl and PO vanco (possible C.
   diff).  Serum b-glucan and galactomannan both negative (fungal
   infection less likely).
   ACIDOSIS -- appears predmoniately elevated dead space ventilation.
   Monitor, goal pH>7.20.  Now improved.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- improved.  Continue free H2O.
   ANEMIA -- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; elevated PT on lovenox; maintain
   Hct >27.  Rising plts.  Recheck coags (PT/PT).
   s/p RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENT -- complicated by infection.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Ortho Service following.
   FLUIDS -- Currently, hypovolemic, desire net positive fluid balance,
   monitor CVP.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- tolerating; continue TF --> advance to goal
   rate.
   OSA -- Not active issue currently while intubated.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they are currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient has a history of sepsis, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), pneumonia, and a right knee replacement that was complicated by an infection. They are also experiencing hypotension, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, fever, acidosis, hypernatremia, anemia, and hypo-kalemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/45 to 133/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a CVP of 11 mmHg.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet levels, normal creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategies, monitoring ABG and maintaining SaO2 > 90% or pO2 > 60 mmHg. They will also be weaned off vasopressors as tolerated, and their antimicrobials will be continued. Other interventions include maintaining Hct > 27, rechecking coagulation parameters, and monitoring fluid balance.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and sepsis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/37 mmHg to 72/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, vancomycin, azithromycin, meropenem, metronidazole, pantoprazole, enoxaparin, and lasix. The patient's blood cultures and respiratory studies from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) have been negative.

The patient's physical examination shows distant heart sounds, scant crackles in the lungs, soft abdomen with no tenderness, and slight crusting of serum at the edges of a knee wound with bilateral pitting edema. The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 160 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 36 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, sodium of 123 mEq/L, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, and glucose levels ranging from 106 to 182 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing current antibiotic regimen, monitoring fever curve and white blood cell count, weaning FiO2 if oxygenation is tolerated, and continuing small tidal volume ventilation as a lung protective strategy.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, fluid overload, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).

Overall, the patient is improving with no fever and negative rheum studies, but there are concerns regarding the patient's oxygenation not improving despite being on mechanical ventilation and the potential for developing further complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ARDS/Sepsis. The patient has experienced several significant events during their stay, including changes in sedation, inability to wean pressors, and a notable bowel movement. The patient's allergies are listed as no known drug allergies.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for their condition, including vancomycin, azithromycin, meropenem, and metronidazole. They are also on infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation management, respectively.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's weight is 100.9 kg, and their height is 73 inches. Their central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 4,248 mL and output of 2,227 mL since midnight, resulting in a positive balance of 2,021 mL. They are receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 8."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea, total knee replacement surgery post septic arthritis washout. He is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory failure caused by congestive heart failure, hemorrhage, and acute lung injury. The patient is also suspected to have sepsis, with an unknown source. He has persistent respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. His blood pressure is low, indicating ongoing hypotension. The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient remains dependent on the ventilator and requires high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The goal is to decrease FiO2 and then gradually reduce PEEP.
2. Sepsis: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole. Cultures are pending to identify the source of infection.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be managed by providing free water.
4. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's immobility may lead to further complications such as muscle weakness, deep vein thrombosis, and pressure ulcers.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the ventilator can cause skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
6. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's respiratory"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of ARDS/Sepsis. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, pain management, and nutritional support.

From the note, it appears that the patient's condition has been improving, as they are afebrile and showing improvement in response to the current antibiotic regimen. However, there are some concerns and potential medical complications that may arise.

1. Oxygenation: The patient is experiencing difficulties in weaning off FiO2, indicating that oxygenation is not improving. This suggests that the ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) may not be resolving as expected. The high level of PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) required also indicates the need for continued ventilatory support.

2. Fluid balance: The patient is hypernatremic, indicating an imbalance in sodium levels. The note suggests that free water flushes may be causing high residuals, so these will be discontinued. The patient will be started on D5W (5% dextrose in water) at 125cc/hr and meropenem will be mixed in D5W instead of normal saline.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct (hematocrit) has decreased from 26.9 to 24.7. A transfusion goal Hct of >21 is mentioned, but the patient's current Hct level is 27"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They have been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, septicemia, hypernatremia, impaired physical mobility, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is also an ongoing concern about the patient's high sodium levels, anemia, and intermittent fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's condition may worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. There is a risk of developing severe lung injury or the need for more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and positive blood cultures indicate a potential ongoing infection. This could lead to a progression of sepsis, organ dysfunction, or the development of new infections.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can lead to dehydration, increased intracranial pressure, and electrolyte imbalances if not managed appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is low, indicating a need for further evaluation and management. If left untreated, anemia can result in decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and fatigue.
5. Impaired Physical Mobility: Prolonged immobility can increase the risk of muscle weakness, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pressure ul"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and sepsis. The patient did not tolerate pressure support and was found to be very acidotic. The medical team considered the possibility of tracheostomy placement and scheduled a family meeting to discuss this option. The patient's blood cultures and respiratory studies from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) have been negative, ruling out Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma infections. Antibiotics azithromycin and flagyl were discontinued as they tested negative for any bacterial growth. The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to high residual volumes and is planned to have post-pyloric tube feeds. The patient's HCT (hematocrit) is stable, and the plan is to continue monitoring it. The patient has a stage II sacral ulcer and requires wound care consultation. The patient also has a blister on the sacrum. The patient's acidosis needs to be monitored with a goal pH of greater than 7.20. The patient's sepsis is improving, as indicated by being afebrile and negative rheum studies. A CT angiogram (CTA) has been ordered to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and the medical team is planning to decrease PEEP to 10 and continue with small tidal volume ventilation as a lung protective strategy.

   Assessment and Plan
   # ARDS: Appears that oxygenation is not improving. Unable to wean Fi02
   yesterday.   Patient still on high level of PEEP and requires high
   minute volume.  Patient is also volume overloaded and has worsening
   bilateral pleural effusions on chest x-ray.  Of consideration, will
   need to address possibility of placing Trach with family.  Not a
   current issue as patient requires PEEP of 12 and is not improving,
   however may be something to consider later in the week.
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - Will try to keep Fentanyl dose at 150mcg
   - Decrease PEEP to 10
   - Continue Lasix gtt @ 2mg with use of pressors, goal 1-2L negative
   today
   - CTA to rule out PE
   - Discontinue Vanc/Meropenem

   83 yo M w/ ARDS and septic physiology
   # ARDS: Oxygenation reasonably stable with decreased PEEP and
   ventilation significantly improved likely [**2-11**] increased blood flow to
   ventilated portions of lung after decreasing PEEP. Likely will need
   trach/peg for prolonged wean.  CTA chest yesterday was negative for PE.
   TTE also negative for large shunt.
   - IP consult for trach/peg
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - Slowly wean sedation to fentanyl patch and PO diazepam.
   - Continue PEEP at 8 as O2 likely will not tolerate further decrease
   - Continue Lasix gtt @ 2mg unless becomes hypotense
   .
   # Sepsis:  Improving physiology, off of pressors.  Afebrile since [**4-19**].
   All cultures to date have been negative. Likely that sedation is adding
   to septic physiology. Will d/w ID how long he should be continued on
   Abx and which Abx he should be continued on for his knee, as likely can
   be narrowed to nafcillin. Will need to have central line out as soon as
   infusion requirements have decreased.
   - Plan for PICC after trach/peg
   - Continue vancomycin for today
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS and septic physiology. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His oxygenation has improved with decreased PEEP, but he still requires tracheostomy and prolonged weaning. The patient's septic physiology is improving, and he is off of pressors. All cultures have been negative, suggesting that sedation may be contributing to the septic physiology. The plan is to continue vancomycin for today and monitor fever curve and WBC. The patient also has a grade II sacral ulcer and a post-gastrocnemius flap wound, which appear stable. He is being treated with TPN and will be retried on NG tube. The patient is receiving enoxaparin and pantoprazole prophylactically. His current medications include fentanyl, enoxaparin, pantoprazole, and meropenem.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be maintained.
2. Tracheostomy-related complications: The planned tracheostomy carries potential risks such as bleeding, infection, or tracheal stenosis. These risks should be discussed with the patient and his family.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS and septic physiology
   # ARDS: Oxygenation reasonably stable with decreased PEEP and
   ventilation significantly improved likely [**2-11**] increased blood flow to
   ventilated portions of lung after decreasing PEEP. Likely will need
   trach/peg for prolonged wean.  CTA chest yesterday was negative for PE.
   TTE also negative for large shunt.
   - IP consult for trach/peg
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - Slowly wean sedation to fentanyl patch and PO diazepam.
   - Continue PEEP at 8 as O2 likely will not tolerate further decrease
   - Continue Lasix gtt @ 2mg unless becomes hypotense
   .
   # Sepsis:  Improving physiology, off of pressors.  Afebrile since [**4-19**].
   All cultures to date have been negative. Likely that sedation is adding
   to septic physiology. Will d/w ID how long he should be continued on
   Abx and which Abx he should be continued on for his knee, as likely can
   be narrowed to nafcillin. Will need to have central line out as soon as
   infusion requirements have decreased.
   - Plan for PICC after trach/peg
   - Continue vancomycin for today
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   #Acidosis: Respiratory [**2-11**] large dead space, metabolic component has
   resolved w/ resolution of sepsis
   - Continue current ventilator settings
   - Consider decreasing respiratory rate to reduce mucous plugging
   .
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Patient using air mattress, wound care per
   nursing.
   - Wound care consult initiated, will f/u recommendations
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks stable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

From the progress note, it can be observed that the patient has shown some improvement in oxygenation with decreased PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) and ventilation. However, the patient still requires a tracheostomy and prolonged weaning due to ARDS.

Regarding sepsis, the patient's physiology is improving, and they are off of pressors. The patient has been afebrile since April 19th, and all cultures to date have been negative. It is planned to continue vancomycin for today and monitor the fever curve and white blood cell count.

The patient also has a grade II sacral ulcer, which is being managed with wound care and an air mattress. The patient had a previous gastroc wound flap surgery, and the wound appears stable. Routine post-operative care will be continued, and gram-positive coverage will be maintained.

The patient has anemia, and further evaluation and management are recommended. The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to high residual volumes from nasogastric (NG) tube, but this will be re-evaluated. Doboff placement was unsuccessful yesterday.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU care.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS and septic physiology
   # ARDS: Like in combination with baseline severe COPD.  Able to
   decrease PEEP to 10 overnight but did not tolerate decreased PEEP to
   8.  CTA chest 2 days ago was negative for PE. TTE also negative for
   large shunt. ? could also partly be due to aspiration
   - Thoracics c/s for trach and j tube, peg likely will not work given
   high residuals on TF.  Likely will need trach/peg for prolonged wean.
   Pt  being seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6981**] p [**Numeric Identifier 6982**] and likely will be added on OR
   schedule for  tomorrow.
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - Slowly wean sedation unless pt begins breathing over vent, continue
   fentanyl patch and wean fentanyl and turn versed off. Keep sedation -1
   to -2.
   - Continue Lasix gtt and metalozone with goal neg 2L, hold lasix gtt
   for MAP<60
   - speak with Ortho about starting steroids given  poor respiratory
   improvement
   .
   # Sepsis:  Improving physiology, off of pressors.  Afebrile since [**4-19**].
   All cultures to date have been negative. Likely that sedation is adding
   to septic physiology. Will d/w ID how long he should be continued on
   Abx and which Abx he should be continued on for his knee, as likely can
   be narrowed to nafcillin. Will need to have central line out as soon as
   infusion requirements have decreased.
   - Plan for PICC after trach/j tube
   - Continue vancomycin for today but will discuss with ID d/c vanco
   given no white count, afebrile, and no pus at line sites.  Would then
   restart nafcillin for his knee.
   -Unfortunately he is very difficult access and given no sign of
   infection at line sites, no white count, and afebrile will keep current
   access for now.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   -will check LFTs per ID request
   #Acidosis: Respiratory [**2-11**] large dead space, metabolic component has
   resolved w/ resolution of sepsis
   - Continue current ventilator settings
   - Consider decreasing respiratory rate to reduce mucous plugging
   .
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Patient using air mattress, wound care per
   nursing.
   -seen by wound care, ulcer not progressing per nursing
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks stable.
   -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   - continue gram positive coverage, if d/c vanco will start nafcillin
   -plan for PT today
   -plan for ortho to manipulate leg while pt in OR
   .
   # Anemia: Phlebotomizing downward
   - active T/S
   - Transfuse Hct<21

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS and sepsis. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The note mentions several potential medical complications:

1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's condition is severe, and there is a mention of baseline severe COPD. The patient has not tolerated decreased PEEP to 8, indicating difficulty weaning off the ventilator. A chest CT scan and TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) were negative for pulmonary embolism and large shunt, respectively.

2. Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology is improving, and they are off of pressors. Cultures have been negative, suggesting no ongoing infection. The ID (infectious disease) team recommends continuing antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, until further discussion.

3. Acidosis: The patient has respiratory acidosis due to large dead space and a metabolic component that has resolved with the resolution of sepsis.

4. Grade II sacral ulcer: The patient is using an air mattress and wound care is being provided by the nursing staff. The wound is not progressing.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS and septic physiology
   # ARDS: Like in combination with baseline severe COPD.  Able to
   decrease PEEP to 10 overnight but did not tolerate decreased PEEP to
   8.  CTA chest 2 days ago was negative for PE. TTE also negative for
   large shunt. ? could also partly be due to aspiration
   - Thoracics c/s for trach and j tube, peg likely will not work given
   high residuals on TF.  Likely will need trach/peg for prolonged wean.
   Pt  being seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6981**] p [**Numeric Identifier 6982**] and likely will be added on OR
   schedule for  tomorrow.
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - Slowly wean sedation unless pt begins breathing over vent, continue
   fentanyl patch and wean fentanyl and turn versed off. Keep sedation -1
   to -2.
   - Continue Lasix gtt and metalozone with goal neg 2L, hold lasix gtt
   for MAP<60
   - speak with Ortho about starting steroids given  poor respiratory
   improvement
   .
   # Sepsis:  Improving physiology, off of pressors.  Afebrile since [**4-19**].
   All cultures to date have been negative. Likely that sedation is adding
   to septic physiology. Will d/w ID how long he should be continued on
   Abx and which Abx he should be continued on for his knee, as likely can
   be narrowed to nafcillin. Will need to have central line out as soon as
   infusion requirements have decreased.
   - Plan for PICC after trach/j tube
   - Continue vancomycin for today but will discuss with ID d/c vanco
   given no white count, afebrile, and no pus at line sites.  Would then
   restart nafcillin for his knee.
   -Unfortunately he is very difficult access and given no sign of
   infection at line sites, no white count, and afebrile will keep current
   access for now.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   #Acidosis: Respiratory [**2-11**] large dead space, metabolic component has
   resolved w/ resolution of sepsis
   - Continue current ventilator settings
   - Consider decreasing respiratory rate to reduce mucous plugging
   .
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Patient using air mattress, wound care per
   nursing.
   - Wound care consult initiated, will f/u recommendations
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks stable.
   -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   - continue gram positive coverage
   # Anemia: Phlebotomizing downward
   - Send active T/S
   - Transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # FEN: Patient currently on TPN secondary to high residual volumes from
   NG but given that has been having more BMs will retry to use NG. Doboff
   placement unsuccessful yesterday.
   -f/u pm lytes given large volume diuresis.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS and septic physiology. The patient has severe COPD and is on mechanical ventilation. The PEEP was decreased to 10 overnight but did not tolerate a decrease to 8. A CT angiogram of the chest two days ago was negative for a pulmonary embolism. A transthoracic echocardiogram also showed no large shunt. The potential causes for the patient's condition could be aspiration or a combination of ARDS and severe COPD.

The patient is planned for a thoracostomy tube placement and possible tracheostomy with a planned tracheostomy and percutaneous endotracheal (PEG) tube due to high residual volumes on the tidal volume (TV). The patient is being seen by a thoracic surgeon and will likely be added to the operating room schedule for tomorrow.

The plan is to continue small TV with high-frequency RR as a lung-protective strategy. Sedation should be weaned slowly unless the patient begins breathing over the vent, and the fentanyl patch and wean fentanyl should be continued. The patient will receive lasix gtt and metalozone, aiming for negative fluid balance of 2 liters. Lasix gtt should be held for mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 60.

The patient has sepsis with improving physiology and is off pressors. He is afebrile since April 19th. All cultures have been negative"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS and septic physiology
   # ARDS: Like in combination with baseline severe COPD.  Able to
   decrease PEEP to 10 overnight but did not tolerate decreased PEEP to
   8.  CTA chest 2 days ago was negative for PE. TTE also negative for
   large shunt. ? could also partly be due to aspiration
   - Thoracics c/s for trach and j tube, peg likely will not work given
   high residuals on TF.  Likely will need trach/peg for prolonged wean.
   Pt  being seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6981**] p [**Numeric Identifier 6982**] and likely will be added on OR
   schedule for  tomorrow.
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - Slowly wean sedation unless pt begins breathing over vent, continue
   fentanyl patch and wean fentanyl and turn versed off. Keep sedation -1
   to -2.
   - Continue Lasix gtt and metalozone with goal neg 2L, hold lasix gtt
   for MAP<60
   - speak with Ortho about starting steroids given  poor respiratory
   improvement
   .
   # Sepsis:  Improving physiology, off of pressors.  Afebrile since [**4-19**].
   All cultures to date have been negative. Likely that sedation is adding
   to septic physiology. Will d/w ID how long he should be continued on
   Abx and which Abx he should be continued on for his knee, as likely can
   be narrowed to nafcillin. Will need to have central line out as soon as
   infusion requirements have decreased.
   - Plan for PICC after trach/j tube
   - Continue vancomycin for today but will discuss with ID d/c vanco
   given no white count, afebrile, and no pus at line sites.  Would then
   restart nafcillin for his knee.
   -Unfortunately he is very difficult access and given no sign of
   infection at line sites, no white count, and afebrile will keep current
   access for now.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   #Acidosis: Respiratory [**2-11**] large dead space, metabolic component has
   resolved w/ resolution of sepsis
   - Continue current ventilator settings
   - Consider decreasing respiratory rate to reduce mucous plugging
   .
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Patient using air mattress, wound care per
   nursing.
   - Wound care consult initiated, will f/u recommendations
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks stable.
   -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   - continue gram positive coverage
   # Anemia: Phlebotomizing downward
   - Send active T/S
   - Transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # FEN: Patient currently on TPN secondary to high residual volumes from
   NG but given that has been having more BMs will retry to use NG. Doboff

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and sepsis. The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 35 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. Oxygenation is maintained with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 166, which suggests moderate oxygenation.

2. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a total input of 3,297 mL and output of 4,210 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -913 mL.

3. Sedation: The patient is sedated and not arousable. The sedation plan includes slowly weaning sedation unless the patient begins breathing over the ventilator, continuing fentanyl patch, and weaning fentanyl while turningversed off. Sedation level should be maintained at -1 to -2.

4. Antibiotics: The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and metronidazole for suspected infection. The plan is to continue vancomycin for today and discuss with ID regarding discontinuation due to no signs of infection at line sites, absence of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS and sepsis. He has been sedated and not arousable. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 163/70 mmHg to 96/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute. The patient has been given various medications including fentanyl, lasix, midazolam, vancomycin, meropenem, pantoprazole, enoxaparin, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Regular surveillance and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered to prevent or treat VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) should be continued to prevent DVT.
3. Pressure injuries"

   portions of lung after decreasing PEEP. Likely will need trach/peg for
   prolonged wean.  CTA chest yesterday was negative for PE. TTE also
   negative for large shunt.
   - IP consult for trach/peg
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - Slowly wean sedation to fentanyl patch and PO diazepam.
   - Continue PEEP at 8 as O2 likely will not tolerate further decrease
   - Continue Lasix gtt @ 2mg unless becomes hypotense

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS and sepsis. He is currently in the ICU and is sedated, not arousable. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 163/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including acidosis, anemia, FEN (likely referring to feeding or enteral nutrition), grade II sacral ulcer, and s/p gastroc wound flap. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. He has multiple lines including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and a 20-gauge line. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, lasix, vancomycin, meropenem, pantoprazole, enoxaparin, and morphine sulfate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and sepsis. The patient has shown improvement in oxygenation and ventilation after decreasing PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) levels, indicating better blood flow to ventilated portions of the lung. It is anticipated that the patient will require a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg) for prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient's septic physiology is improving, with the cessation of vasopressors and absence of fever since April 19th. All cultures have been negative, suggesting no active infection. The patient's sedation is being gradually weaned off, and it is recommended to continue vancomycin for one more day.

The patient also has a grade II sacral ulcer, which is being managed with wound care and an air mattress. The patient recently underwent a gastrocnemius muscle flap procedure and the wound appears stable. Routine post-operative care is being provided by the surgical and plastics team.

Other medical issues include anemia, for which phlebotomy is being utilized, and a feeding tube (NG) that is currently unable to be used due to high residual volumes. However, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and attempts will be made to retry using the NG tube.

The patient is also receiving prophylactic enoxaparin (lovenox"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS and septic physiology
   # ARDS: Like in combination with baseline severe COPD.  Able to
   decrease PEEP to 10 overnight but did not tolerate decreased PEEP to
   8.  CTA chest 2 days ago was negative for PE. TTE also negative for
   large shunt. ? could also partly be due to aspiration
   - Thoracics c/s for trach and j tube, peg likely will not work given
   high residuals on TF.  Likely will need trach/peg for prolonged wean.
   Pt  being seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6981**] p [**Numeric Identifier 6982**] and likely will be added on OR
   schedule for  tomorrow.
   - continue small TV w/ high frequency RR as lung protective strategy
   - Slowly wean sedation unless pt begins breathing over vent, continue
   fentanyl patch and wean fentanyl and turn versed off. Keep sedation -1
   to -2.
   - Continue Lasix gtt and metalozone with goal neg 2L, hold lasix gtt
   for MAP<60
   - speak with Ortho about starting steroids given  poor respiratory
   improvement
   .
   # Sepsis:  Improving physiology, off of pressors.  Afebrile since [**4-19**].
   All cultures to date have been negative. Likely that sedation is adding
   to septic physiology. Will d/w ID how long he should be continued on
   Abx and which Abx he should be continued on for his knee, as likely can
   be narrowed to nafcillin. Will need to have central line out as soon as
   infusion requirements have decreased.
   - Plan for PICC after trach/j tube
   - Continue vancomycin for today but will discuss with ID d/c vanco
   given no white count, afebrile, and no pus at line sites.  Would then
   restart nafcillin for his knee.
   -Unfortunately he is very difficult access and given no sign of
   infection at line sites, no white count, and afebrile will keep current
   access for now.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   -will check LFTs per ID request
   #Acidosis: Respiratory [**2-11**] large dead space, metabolic component has
   resolved w/ resolution of sepsis
   - Continue current ventilator settings
   - Consider decreasing respiratory rate to reduce mucous plugging
   .
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Patient using air mattress, wound care per
   nursing.
   -seen by wound care, ulcer not progressing per nursing
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Wound looks stable.
   -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   - continue gram positive coverage, if d/c vanco will start nafcillin
   -plan for PT today
   -plan for ortho to manipulate leg while pt in OR
   .
   # Anemia: Phlebotomizing downward
   - active T/S
   - Transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # FEN: Patient currently on TPN secondary to high residual volumes from
   NG.  Pt also on tube feeds.
   -plan for j tube when pt gets trached
   -f/u pm lytes given large volume diuresis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS and septic physiology. He is currently sedated and not arousable. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/45 mmHg to 145/56 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient has a history of severe COPD and has undergone a tracheostomy and jejunostomy tube placement. He is receiving multiple medications including sedatives, analgesics, and antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and troponin T levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and albumin levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's ARDS and COPD increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further deterioration of lung function.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's septic physiology is improving, there is still a risk of recurrent sepsis due to the presence of multiple lines and tubes, which can serve as potential sources of infection.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and advanced age increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with the presence of a gastrostomy tube.
5. Wound Infection: The patient's sacral ulcer and recent surgical procedures increase the risk of wound infection.
6. Anemia: The patient's ongoing phlebotomy and potential blood loss from various procedures may lead to anemia.
7. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating a risk of dehydration.
8. Medication Errors: With the complex medication regimen, there is a risk of medication errors, especially with the use of sedatives and analgesics.
9. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure.
- He was admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and had a total knee replacement (TKR) with complications including septic arthritis.
- The patient requires invasive ventilatory support due to persistent ventilatory failure and high Vd/Vt.
- He also has persistent depression of mental status in the setting of excess sedation.
- Plans include moving to pressure support ventilation (PSV) once the patient returns from the operating room, continuing diuresis, weaning sedation as possible after tracheostomy, and hoping for a rapid wean following tracheostomy.
- Steroid therapy will be continued, and a tracheostomy and feeding tube (PEG placement) will be performed today.
- The patient has sepsis, for which a knee washout has been planned by the orthopedic team, and antibiotic therapy will be continued.
- ICU care includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, arterial line for blood gas monitoring, multi-lumen central line, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent ventilatory failure and high Vd/Vt indicate a need for continued invasive ventilatory support. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if weaning attempts fail"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS and septic physiology. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and laboratory values. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS is severe, and he is on high FiO2 (60%) and PEEP (10 cmH2O). There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and respiratory function.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's septic physiology is improving, there is still a risk of infection due to prolonged ICU stay, invasive lines, and immobility. Close monitoring for signs of infection is essential.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory secretions and appropriate antibiotic coverage are crucial.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin (e.g., Lovenox) should be continued.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal issues, and the use of anticoagulants and invasive procedures may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and stool/blackberry mucous output is necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS and septic physiology. He has been on mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes. His sedation has been weaned off, and he is expected to undergo a pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial today. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, Vt set at 500 mL, RR set at 35, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, PIP at 27 cmH2O, and plateau pressure at 21 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals increased jugular venous distention (JVD), rales in both lung bases, positive fluid balance, lower extremity edema up to the knees, and right knee in a brace. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 152/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. Other labs include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and septic physiology. The patient has undergone tracheostomy (Trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is tolerating it well, with improving blood gases and oxygen saturation in the 90s on 50% FiO2. The patient is continuing to diurese well to Lasix. The plan includes continuing PSV, discontinuing midazolam, continuing fentanyl, and considering weaning off mechanical ventilation. The patient's ID (Infectious Disease) is improving, with negative cultures and no fever since April 19th. Long-term nafcillin for the knee will be continued. A central line needs to be removed as soon as infusion requirements decrease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to the use of the ventilator.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and decreased tissue perfusion.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immune system may be"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS who has undergone tracheostomy and peg placement. He is currently on pressure support ventilation and his blood gases are improving. The patient is also diuresing well with lasix and his oxygen saturation levels are in the 90s on 50% FiO2.

The patient has been febrile and pan-cultured this morning due to a fever of 101 degrees. There is concern for developing an infection in his right knee wound, which had wound dehiscence from continuous passive motion (CPM). 

The patient's acidosis has improved, with the respiratory component resolving and the metabolic component resolving with the resolution of sepsis. 

There are several other medical issues mentioned in the note, including a grade II sacral ulcer, s/p gastroc wound flap with dehiscence post CPM, anemia, FEN (gastrointestinal feeding), PPX (prophylactic physical therapy), and code status. 

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including fentanyl, lasix, PSV (pressure support ventilation), methylprednisolone, and vancomycin. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include developing an infection in the right knee wound, worsening of the sacral ulcer, worsening of the anemia, and potential complications related to the ongoing gastrointestinal feeding and wound care management."

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and septic physiology. He has been intubated and placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been in the 90s on 50% FiO2, and he has been tolerating the ventilator support well. His fluid balance is positive with a total input of 3,725 mL and output of 6,900 mL, indicating diuresis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/48 to 166/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has a slight elevation in jugular venous distention (JVD). 

Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the right and left lung bases anteriorly, rales in the lungs, increased JVD, and right knee in a brace with dependent edema and positive pitting edema in the hands. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. 

The patient's plan includes continuing diuretics to achieve a negative fluid balance of 3-4 liters, discontinuing midazolam, continuing fentanyl, maintaining pressure support ventilation, and continuing methylprednis"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male who has been hospitalized for 43 days after knee replacement surgery complicated by joint sepsis. He has been transferred to the ICU due to hypoxia and required tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient is still experiencing ongoing infectious issues.

Key events over the past 24 hours include vomiting after tube feeds were restarted, diuresis with lasix, and a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has been pancultured, and his last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on [**2188-4-24**] at 08:37 AM and nafcillin on [**2188-4-26**] at 02:17 AM. The patient is currently receiving furosemide (lasix) at a rate of 8 mg/hour and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: tmax 38.3°C (101°F), current temperature 38.3°C, heart rate 79 bpm (72-97 bpm), blood pressure 139/55 mmHg (80-166/56 mmHg), respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute (14-24 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation 96%, and heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 100.9 kg, and he has gained 8.6 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,725 mL, with 1,288 mL given through IV fluids, 57 mL through PO, and 1,846 mL through total in. The total output is 6,900 mL, with 3,540 mL through urine, 100 mL through NG, and 500 mL through stool. The patient has a positive fluid balance of -3,175 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a spontaneous Vt of 613 mL (552-672 mL), PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 19 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 96%. ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 68 mmHg, SaO2 of 101%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 202. The patient's respiratory support parameters are deferred due to PEEP >10.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, has PERRL eyes/conjunctiva, normocephalic head/ears/nose/throat, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, warm skin, trace edema in the lower extremities, muscle wasting, inability to stand, and normal neurologic examination findings. The patient is sedated and responds to tactile stimuli.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of ARDS, who has undergone tracheostomy and peg tube placement. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set Vt of 0 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 0, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. His SpO2 is 96% and ABG shows a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 58 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 164.

The patient has been febrile since yesterday AM, so vancomycin was switched back and the patient was pan cultured. Cultures are pending. The plan is to start a PICC line once the patient's infusion requirements decrease and he is afebrile, with follow-up CXRs.

The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer, which is being managed with air mattress and wound care per nursing. The wound is not progressing, according to the nursing staff. The patient also has hypernatremia, likely due to contraction alkalosis from a large volume diuresis. Lasix has been held today.

The patient developed dehiscence of his gastroc wound flap post continuous motion, and ortho and plastics will determine the optimal knee motion regimen. Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team is being provided. Vancomycin has"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS and sepsis from a right knee infection. He is currently in the ICU. The patient's recent events include wound dehiscence being managed by orthopedics and plastics, back on Vancomycin with a reduction in fever since the antibiotic change, diuresed a large amount of fluid with Lasix discontinued, holding TF's due to high residuals, and started on Labetolol for hypertensive episodes yesterday.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 Fahrenheit), heart rate of 72 bpm with a range of 67-79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/46 mmHg to 191/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute with a range of 14-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a set volume of 0-0 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.0 K/uL, hematocrit of 25.8%, platelet count of 304, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide of 42 mEq/L, blood glucose of 117 mg/dL, and albumin of 1.5 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. ARDS: The patient is a tracheostomy and peg tube in place. He is tolerating pressure support ventilation and has improving blood gases. His oxygen saturation has been in the 90s on 50% FiO2.
   - Hold further diuretics
   - Discontinue Midazolam, continue Fentanyl
   - Continue PSV
   - Continue methylprednisolone 100mg IV q24

2. ID: Improving physiology, off of pressors now and afebrile since 4-19. All cultures to date have been negative. Spiked this AM, recultured. The patient is on long-term nafcillin for his knee.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) who has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate ranging from 66-80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 146/52-189/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and responsive to simple commands.

The patient has a history of ARDS, for which he is receiving mechanical ventilation. His recent events include small amounts of blood aspirated from the PEG tube, decreased PEEP to 6 cmH2O, repletion of free water deficit, initiation of erythromycin, and discontinuation of metoclopramide.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's ABG values indicate a mild respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.47.

Assessment and plan:
1. ARDS: The patient is showing improvement with better oxygenation and no longer acidotic. The plan includes continuing fentanyl patch, attempting a spontaneous breathing"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of ARDS, who has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

1. ARDS: The patient is still experiencing difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation and requires continued support. Tracheostomy and sedation management are planned to improve mental status and facilitate tracheostomy mask trials.

2. ID: The patient's right knee graft has dehisced, leading to concern for possible infection. He is now only being treated for the septic knee. Vancomycin therapy is being continued, and further recommendations from the ID team regarding vancomycin vs. nafcillin will be followed. The central line will be pulled once a PICC line is in place.

3. Grade II sacral ulcer: The patient is using an air mattress, and wound care is being provided by nursing. The wound care team has assessed the ulcer, which is not progressing as expected.

4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient is compensating for likely chronic CO2 retention due to COPD. Diuresis can be resumed.

5. s/p gastroc wound flap: The patient developed dehiscence post continuous motion. Ortho and plastics will determine the optimal knee motion regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS who has undergone tracheostomy and peg placement. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has shown improvement with a significant reduction in dead space and resolution of acidosis. The goal for today is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/39 to 155/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,087 mL and output of 3,450 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 363 mL. He is receiving various medications through infusions, including fentanyl patch, tracheostomy care, methylprednisolone, vancomycin, and others. 

Laboratory results indicate normal levels for white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, with slight variations in other parameters such as creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and electrolytes. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. ARDS: The patient is expected to tolerate pressure support and will attempt SBT today. Dead space appears to have significantly improved, and the patient is no longer acidotic. The plan is to continue fentanyl patch, attempt tracheostomy mask trial today, discontinue methylprednis"

- The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS who has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved with the tracheostomy, as indicated by better oxygen saturation levels.
- There are concerns about prolonged sedation affecting mental status.
- The patient's urine benzodiazepine screen is negative.
- Orthopedic and plastic surgery teams recommend continued passive motion for the patient's right knee.
- The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer, which appears to be improving.
- There is anemia, possibly due to critical illness, and the patient is being monitored for transfusion requirements.
- The patient has a gastrocnemius muscle flap and is scheduled for physical therapy.
- The patient's blood cultures remain negative, and intravenous antibiotics will be switched from vancomycin to levofloxacin and rifampin once the vancomycin trough is below 20.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure.
- The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated liver enzymes and creatinine levels.
- The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), who underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.
- The patient has respiratory failure, likely due to prolonged sedation, which is slowly improving. He is being weaned off sedatives and will attempt spontaneous breathing once his mental status improves. COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is present at baseline.
- Mental status has shown improvement compared to the previous day. Urine benzodiazepines are negative. Mental status monitoring will continue, with plans to administer narcan and obtain brain imaging if there is a worsening of mental status.
- The patient has been afebrile for more than 72 hours, and the ID team has started levofloxacin and rifampin once the vancomycin trough is below 20. Central venous line (CVL) removal and placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line have been performed. Cultures remain negative.
- The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer that appears to be improving. Wound care dressings will be continued.
- Post-operative care for the gastrocnemius wound flap is being provided. Consultation with plastics will be sought for further recommendations. Vancomycin will be changed to levo"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS, who has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
- He has been experiencing respiratory failure, with slow breathing and poor mental status, likely due to long-term sedation. The plan is to attempt extubation once the mental status improves.
- The patient's mental status has been stable compared to the previous day, and urine benzodiazepine test was negative.
- The patient had a fever last night, and further investigations were ordered, including urine analysis, chest X-ray, line culture, peripheral blood culture, and Clostridium difficile toxin test. If the fever spikes again, consideration will be given to restarting vancomycin.
- The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer, which appears to be improving with regular wound care dressings.
- He underwent a gastrocnemius muscle flap procedure and is advised to continue with routine post-operative care per surgical and plastics team. Passive motion of the right knee will also be planned.
- The patient's hematocrit level is stable, but he requires transfusion due to critical illness.
- The patient has hypernatremia, for which free water administration is recommended.
- He is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
- Prophylactic low molecular weight"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Got free water D5W at 250cc/hr to replete free water deficit. Na went
   from 153 to 143.
   Ortho said that they would handle CPM orders, order in
   TSH normal 2.9\
   Vomitted alot so TFs stopped, started PO narcan and restarted TPN.
   Rediscussed PEJ tube w/ family and they definitely do not want open
   procedure, but may be open to advancing with scope in a week. Discussed
   goals of care and they will watch over the next week for improvement
   and then decide on whether he would have wanted this for this long.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. 

The patient has several medical complications and ongoing concerns:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is suffering from respiratory failure, which is likely due to prolonged sedation. The plan is to attempt weaning from the ventilator once the patient's mental status improves.

2. Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been stable recently, but there is a concern for worsening. If the mental status deteriorates, the team will try naloxone (narcan) and then consider brain imaging.

3. Infection: The patient had a spiked fever last night, indicating a possible infection. The team plans to obtain urine analysis, chest X-ray, line cultures, peripheral cultures, C. difficile test, and sputum culture. They will continue levofloxacin and rifampin and consider restarting vancomycin if the fever recurs.

4. Grade II Sacral Ulcer: The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer that appears to be improving. The team will continue with wound care dressings as recommended by wound care.

5. Postoperative Care: The patient underwent a gastrocnemius muscle flap procedure and is recommended to undergo continuous passive motion (CPM) therapy. However, the team will first consult with plastics before proceeding.

   24 Hour Events:
   Got free water D5W at 250cc/hr to replete free water deficit. Na went
   from 153 to 143.
   Ortho said that they would handle CPM orders, order in
   TSH normal 2.9
   Vomitted alot so TFs stopped, started PO narcan and restarted TPN.
   Rediscussed PEJ tube w/ family and they definitely do not want open
   procedure, but may be open to advancing with scope in a week. Discussed
   goals of care and they will watch over the next week for improvement
   and then decide on whether he would have wanted this for this long.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS who has undergone tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. He is currently in the ICU and has a history of COPD. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.5°F, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 153/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 100.9 kg. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,825 mL and a total output of 2,275 mL. The patient is receiving various medications and infusions, including enoxaparin (Lovenox), rifampin, and levofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's breathing is very slow, likely due to long-term sedative washout. There is a concern for ongoing respiratory failure, especially considering the patient's underlying COPD and recent aspiration event.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia vs Pneumonitis: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event, resulting in worsening opacity on the chest X-ray. This suggests the possibility of aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status has significantly improved, allowing him to move distal extremities. However, there is still a need to minimize narcotics to avoid sedation.
4. Sacral Ulcer: The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. He has a history of COPD and was admitted for septic knee. The patient's mental status has significantly improved, and he is able to move his distal extremities. However, he experienced aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, as evidenced by worsening opacity on chest X-ray and new productive cough. He also has a grade II sacral ulcer that appears to be improving. The patient's anemia is stable, hypernatremia has resolved, and he is currently receiving TPN and TFs through a PEG tube. He will be advanced to a jejunostomy tube once the tract is mature. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and will be discharged to ICU care with a planned rehab screening this week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis: The patient's recent aspiration event may have led to worsening lung opacity on chest X-ray, suggesting possible pneumonia or pneumonitis. This condition can progress to severe respiratory distress and sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Sacral ulcer: The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer that requires regular dressing changes and wound care. If not managed properly, there is a risk of infection, worsening of the ulcer, or complications related to pressure injuries.
3. Anemia: Although the patient's Hct"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), who has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's neurological status has improved, but he continues to produce a significant amount of sputum and gastric tube output. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS, and there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or pneumonitis. The patient's production of large amounts of sputum, low-grade temperature, and chest X-ray findings indicate a possible infection in the lower lobes of the lungs. Broadening antibiotic coverage to include vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP is recommended.

2. Gastric Ulcer: The patient's large amount of bilious output from the PEG tube may suggest a gastric ulcer or complication related to the PEG tube placement. A non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen should be considered to evaluate the PEG tube placement and rule out any potential ulcers or leaks.

3. Sacral Ulcer: The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer, which appears to be improving. Wound care and dressings are recommended for management.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are stable"

   83 yo M w/ ARDS, s/p Trach and Peg
   #Respiratory failure:  Satting well on trach collar, but breathing very
   slowly likely [**2-11**] long sedative washout, will attempt S/S once mental
   status improves.   Pt has COPD at baseline.  Patient had aspirated
   overnight and has CXR LUL findings that are suggestive for Pneumonia
   versus Pneumonitis.  Patient
s CXR shows interval improvement in RLL
   effusion.
   - Change Levaquin 750mg from po to IV
   - Allow pt to autodiurese, goal 1-2L neg
   .
   # Aspiration Pneumonia vs Pneumonitis:   Tmax 100.5 this AM, WBC 8.8.
   Patient had vomited twice yesterday and had a witnessed aspiration.
   CXR c/w LUL worsening opacity.  Pt with new productive cough.
   - Send Sputum cultures
   - follow BCx, Ucx for other infectious sources
   - Change levo to IV.  (patient on Levo primarily for septic Knee)
   #Mental status:  Significantly improved.  Patient is able to move
   distal extremitities.
   - Minimize narcotics
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Per nursing appears to be improving.
   -dressings as recommended by wound care.
   .
   # s/p gastroc wound flap: Stable.
    -Routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   - continue levofloxacin/rifampin
   -plan for passive motion of R knee per ortho/plastics
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable.
   - recheck HCT
   - active T/S
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Resolved
   .
   # FEN:  Patient currently with Peg tube.  Will wait for tract to mature
   to advance Peg to J tube.  Family wishes not to pursue open J tube
   procedure at this time and wait for tract to mature.  Given that
   patient aspirated yesterday, will restart TPN.  Will also plan to
   restart TFs at 10cc/hr and advance as tolerated.
   - TPN
   - Restart TFs 100cc/hr

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with h/o TKR but now with complication of infection and now
   s/p surgical intervention and now with prolonged hospital course.  This
   course has been notable most recently for difficulty with establishment
   of adequate enteral feeds with inability to get gastic input to advance
   beyond stomach.
   1)Septic Arthritis-
   -Levoflox/Rifampin
   -Continue on LMWH
   2)Respiratory Compromise/Hypoxemia-
   -Patient with left sided infiltrate and with continued relatively high
   volume pulmonary secretions
   -Will expand ABX
   3)Altered Mental Status
much improved at this time with wean of
   sedation
   4)MALNUTRITION--PEG has been placed but gastic feeds not advancing
   beyond stomach and seen on return so patient has been able to be
   continued on TPN but will need distal access.  The rate of drainage is
   concerning for possible outlet obstruction as is really full volume of
   gastric output concerning.
   -Will need to consider tube advancement to allow enteral feeds
   -Will advance via thoracic input and will consider possible GI
   evaluation via contrast study (CT) to look for gastric outlet
   obstruction

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of total knee replacement who is now experiencing complications related to an infection. The patient underwent surgical intervention and has had a prolonged hospital course. Recent difficulties include establishing adequate enteral feeds due to an inability to advance gastric input beyond the stomach.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Arthritis:
- The patient is currently being treated with Levofloxacin and Rifampin.
- Continuous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is also being administered.

2. Respiratory Compromise/Hypoxemia:
- The patient has a left-sided infiltrate and relatively high volume pulmonary secretions.
- Antibiotic coverage will be expanded.

3. Altered Mental Status:
- The patient's mental status has improved with the weaning of sedation.

4. Malnutrition:
- A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube has been placed, but gastric feeds are not advancing.
- Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been continued, but the patient will need distal access.
- Concerns exist about possible outlet obstruction as the gastric output is full.
- Consideration will be given to advancing the tube to allow for enteral feeds.
- A possible gastrointestinal evaluation via contrast study (CT) scan will be performed to assess for gastric outlet obstruction.

Other potential medical complications include:
- Impaired respiration and gas exchange.
- Impaired transfers.
- Benign hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS, s/p trach and PEG, improved from a neurological
   standpoint; however, continues to have significant output from gastric
   tube, also producing large amounts of sputum.
   # Respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia versus HAP versus
   pneumonitis:  satting well on trach collar, but producing large amounts
   of sputum, also with low grade temperature and CXR indicative of
   LLL/LUL pna after aspiration event on [**5-3**].  Pt has COPD at baseline.
   - continue antibx covarage to vanco/Zosyn for HAP (started [**5-5**])
   - send for sputum culture
 poor specimen on [**5-5**]
   - s/p trach [**4-24**]- sutures can be removed today
   - bronchodilator inh prn
   # S/p gastroc wound flap: Stable. MSSA staph aureas from [**3-14**].
    -routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   - continue Zosyn/vanco as above (started on [**5-5**]) for septic knee and
   HAP as above
   - stopped Levo/rifaximin [**5-5**]
   - plan for passive motion of R knee per ortho/plastics
   # FEN:  Patient currently with PEG tube with large amount of bilious
   output (500 cc+ in last 24hr).  Will wait for tract to mature to
   advance PEG to J tube- per thoracics, maturity of tract requires at
   least 4 weeks, closer to 6 weeks in malnourished patients.  Family
   wishes not to pursue open J tube procedure and wait for tract to
   mature.  Given that patient aspirated Saturday, will continue TPN.
   - continue TPN
   - follow-up final read KUB
   - consider placement of post-pyloric dobhoff tube in IR
   - keep PEG tube placed to gravity per thoracics
   # Mental status:  Significantly improved.  Patient is able to move
   distal extremitities and is more interactive than previous.
   - minimize narcotics
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Per nursing appears to be improving.
   -dressings as recommended by wound care.
   # Anemia: Hct stable.
   - active T/S

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS who underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
- The patient's neurological condition has improved, but they continue to produce a large amount of sputum and gastric output.
- The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, and there is uncertainty between aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and pneumonitis. The patient has a history of COPD.
- Antibiotic coverage has been continued with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam for HAP and septic joint.
- Sputum culture has been sent for.
- The patient's tracheostomy sutures can be removed today.
- Bronchodilator inhalation is given as needed.
- The patient has a gastrocnemius wound flap that is stable, with Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection from 03/14. Routine post-operative care is being provided by the surgical/plastics team.
- Antibiotic coverage for the septic knee and HAP is ongoing with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.
- The patient's PEG tube is producing a large amount of bilious output. It is planned to advance the PEG to a jejunostomy tube after the tract matures, which requires at least"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of ARDS, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient has improved neurologically but continues to have significant output from the gastric tube and produces large amounts of sputum. 

The patient's respiratory status remains concerning with ongoing respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been producing large amounts of sputum. The chest X-ray shows signs of left lower lobe (LLL) and left upper lobe (LUL) pneumonia after an aspiration event on [**5-3**]. The patient also has a baseline of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's wound from the gastrocnemius flap procedure is stable, with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection from [**3-14**]. The plastic surgery team recommends limiting range of motion (ROM) to 45 degrees until [**5-9**], then increasing to 90 degrees until [**5-16**], and eventually allowing full ROM. The patient will need follow-up in the plastic surgery clinic one week after discharge.

The patient has a feeding tube in place, but there is a large amount of bilious output. It is planned to advance the feeding tube to a jejunostomy tube once the tract has matured"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS, s/p trach and PEG, improved from a neurological
   standpoint; however, continues to have significant output from gastric
   tube, also producing large amounts of sputum.
   # Respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia versus HAP versus
   pneumonitis:  Satting well on trach collar, but producing large amounts
   of sputum, also with low grade temperature and CXR indicative of
   LLL/LUL pna after aspiration event on Saturday.  Pt has COPD at
   baseline.
   - spoke with ID and will broaden antibx covarage to vanco/Zosyn for HAP
   - send for sputum culture
   - bronchodilator inh prn
   # S/p gastroc wound flap: Stable. MSSA staph aureas from [**3-14**].
    -routine post-op care per surgical/plastics team
   - continue Zosyn/vanco as above (started on [**5-5**]) for septic knee and
   HAP as above
   - stopped Levo/rifaximin [**5-5**]
   - plan for passive motion of R knee per ortho/plastics
   # FEN:  Patient currently with PEG tube with large amount of bilious
   output (500 cc+ in last 24hr).  Will wait for tract to mature to
   advance PEG to J tube.  Family wishes not to pursue open J tube
   procedure and wait for tract to mature.  Given that patient aspirated
   Saturday, will continue TPN.
   - TPN
   - restart TFs 100cc/hr
   - consider non-contrast CT abdomen to evaluate PEG tube placement
   - f/u with surgery re: plan for advancing to J tube
   # Mental status:  Significantly improved.  Patient is able to move
   distal extremitities and is more interactive than previous.

- The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS, tracheostomy, and PEG tube.
- The patient has improved neurologically but continues to have significant output from gastric tube and produce large amounts of sputum.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, with possible aspiration pneumonia, HAP, or pneumonitis.
- The patient has a stable post-operative gastroc wound flap with MSSA infection.
- The patient has a septic knee and is being treated with Vancomycin/Zosyn.
- The patient has bilious output from PEG tube and plans to advance to J-tube once tract matures.
- The patient's mental status has significantly improved, but they are still on minimal narcotics.
- The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer that appears to be improving.
- The patient has resolved hypernatremia and is being monitored for anemia.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are to be disposed to ICU care with a rehab screening this week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to the production of large amounts of sputum, possible aspiration pneumonia, and underlying COPD.

2. Infection: The patient has ongoing infections, including a septic knee, MSSA infection in the gastroc wound flap, and possible HAP or aspiration pneumonia. These infections need to be closely monitored and managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with admission with sepsis and prolonged hospital course
   complicated by persistent ventilatory compromise and concern for
   persistent high G-tube output but no evidence of obstruction on KUB at
   this time.
   1) PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   -Vanco/Zosyn to continue
   -Reasonable discussion with ID about ABX choice is that Vanco/Zosyn
   will allow coverage of septic arthritis and as well as pneumonia
   -8 day course for hosp acquired PNA
   -Pt OOB to chair
   2)Septic Joint-
   -Continue with ABX as defined by ID support in consultation with
   Vancomycin for 6 week course current recommendation
   3)ALTERATION IN NUTRITION-
   -continued on TPN for now
   -G-tube output decreased a bit but still approaches the expected 24
   output from the stomach
   -Would like to consider placement of NGT post pyloric and allow G-tube
   to remain to drainage and allow enteral feeds vit NGT placed post
   pyloric

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS, s/p trach and PEG, improved from a neurological
   standpoint; however, continues to have significant output from gastric
   tube, also with question of pna on CXR being treated for HAP.
   # Respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia versus HAP versus
   pneumonitis: satting well on trach collar, but producing large amounts
   of sputum, also with low grade temperature and CXR indicative of
   LLL/LUL pna after aspiration event on [**5-3**].  Pt has COPD at baseline.
   - continue vanc/Zosyn for HAP (started [**5-5**])
   - s/p trach [**4-24**]- currently on trach mask
   - bronchodilator inh prn
   - contact ID regarding duration of antibiotics, plan for f/u
   # S/p gastroc wound flap: Stable. MSSA staph aureas from [**3-14**].
   - per plastics, ROM should be limited to 45 degrees until [**5-9**], then
   increase to 90 degrees until [**5-16**], then full ROM
   - patient will need f/u in plastic surgery clinic 1 week after
   discharge [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7196**]
   - continue Zosyn/vanc as above (started on [**5-5**]) for septic knee and
   HAP as above
   - stopped Levo/rifaximin [**5-5**]
   # FEN:  Patient currently with PEG tube with large amount of bilious
   output. Will wait for tract to mature to advance PEG to J tube- per
   thoracics, maturity of tract requires at least 4 weeks, closer to 6
   weeks in malnourished patients.  Family wishes not to pursue open J
   tube procedure and wait for tract to mature.  Post-pyloric tube was
   placed on [**5-6**] and tube feeds started. TPN was stopped. Reglan was
   started for bowel dysmotilitiy.
   - continue Reglan
   - keep PEG tube placed to gravity per thoracics
   # Leukocytosis/low-grade temperature:
   - continue vanc/Zosyn as above
   #Diarrhea:
   -last C dif negative from [**5-2**]; will recheck
   # Mental status:  Significantly improved.  Patient is able to move
   distal extremitities and is more interactive than previous.
   - minimize narcotics
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Per nursing appears to be improving.
   -dressings as recommended by wound care.
   # Anemia: Hct stable.
   - active T/S
   #Hypernatremia:  Resolved
   # PPX: continue SC lovenox

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS, who underwent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The patient's neurological condition has improved, but they continue to have significant gastric tube output and there are concerns about possible pneumonia on the chest X-ray, which is being treated as HAP.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with ongoing respiratory failure. There is a question of aspiration pneumonia versus HAP versus pneumonitis. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy collar and producing large amounts of sputum. They also have a history of COPD.

The patient's wound from the gastroc flap procedure is stable, with an infection caused by MSSA, which was identified on 3/14. The plastics team recommends limiting ROM to 45 degrees until 5/9, then increasing to 90 degrees until 5/16, and then full ROM. The patient will need follow-up in the plastic surgery clinic one week after discharge.

The patient has a feeding tube (PEG) with a large amount of bilious output. The plan is to wait for the tract to mature before advancing the PEG to a J-tube. The family does not wish to pursue an open J-tube procedure and prefers to wait for the tract to mature. A post-pyloric tube was placed on 5/6, and tube feeds were"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), who has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He continues to improve neurologically but still requires respiratory support. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia versus hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus pneumonitis, s/p gastroc wound flap with MSSA infection, feeding tube complications, leukocytosis/low-grade temperature, diarrhea, improved mental status, grade II sacral ulcer, anemia, hypernatremia, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing need for respiratory support indicates that there may be ongoing difficulties with breathing, potentially due to ARDS or complications from pneumonia.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's production of large amounts of sputum and low-grade temperature, there is a risk of recurrent aspiration events leading to pneumonia.
3. HAP: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring infections such as HAP.
4. Pneumonitis: The presence of diffuse coarse breath sounds and CXR changes suggests the possibility of inflammation in the lungs, potentially due to an infectious or non-infectious cause.
5. MSSA infection from gastroc wound flap: The patient had a previous wound infection with"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS, s/p trach and PEG, improved from a neurological
   standpoint; however, continues to have significant output from gastric
   tube, also with question of pna on CXR being treated for HAP.
   # Respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia versus HAP versus
   pneumonitis: satting well on trach collar, but producing large amounts
   of sputum, also with low grade temperature and CXR indicative of
   LLL/LUL pna after aspiration event on [**5-3**].  Pt has COPD at baseline.
   - continue vanc/Zosyn for HAP (started [**5-5**])
   - s/p trach [**4-24**]- currently on trach mask
   - bronchodilator inh prn
   - contact ID regarding duration of antibiotics, plan for f/u
   # S/p gastroc wound flap: Stable. MSSA staph aureas from [**3-14**].
   - per plastics, ROM should be limited to 45 degrees until [**5-9**], then
   increase to 90 degrees until [**5-16**], then full ROM
   - patient will need f/u in plastic surgery clinic 1 week after
   discharge [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7196**]
   - continue Zosyn/vanc as above (started on [**5-5**]) for septic knee and
   HAP as above
   - stopped Levo/rifaximin [**5-5**]
   # FEN:  Patient currently with PEG tube with large amount of bilious
   output. Will wait for tract to mature to advance PEG to J tube- per
   thoracics, maturity of tract requires at least 4 weeks, closer to 6
   weeks in malnourished patients.  Family wishes not to pursue open J
   tube procedure and wait for tract to mature.  Post-pyloric tube was
   placed on [**5-6**] and tube feeds started. TPN was stopped. Reglan was
   started for bowel dysmotilitiy.
   - continue Reglan
   - keep PEG tube placed to gravity per thoracics
   # Leukocytosis/low-grade temperature:
   #Diarrhea:
   -check stool C diff
   # Mental status:  Significantly improved.  Patient is able to move
   distal extremitities and is more interactive than previous.
   - minimize narcotics
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Per nursing appears to be improving.
   -dressings as recommended by wound care.
   # Anemia: Hct stable.
   - active T/S
   #Hypernatremia:  Resolved
   # PPX: continue SC lovenox

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS who has undergone tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. He has shown improvement in his neurological status but continues to have significant gastric tube output and is being treated for HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:
1. Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia or HAP, which is already being treated with antibiotics.
2. Pneumonitis, as indicated by the presence of a low-grade temperature and CXR findings.
3. COPD exacerbation due to the patient's baseline condition.
4. Wound infection at the site of the gastrocnemius flap, which is currently stable but requires close monitoring.
5. Development of pressure ulcers, particularly the grade II sacral ulcer that is improving.
6. Bowel dysmotility, as evidenced by the large amount of bilious output from the PEG tube.
7. Potential Clostridium difficile infection, given the presence of diarrhea.
8. Mental status changes, which are being managed by minimizing narcotics.
9. Anemia, with a stable Hct level.
10. Hypernatremia, which has resolved.
11. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with enoxaparin (Lovenox).

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with initial admission with septic arthritis and now with
   ongoing support of establishment of enteral feedings following
   admission to ICU with respiratory failure now maintained with
   tracheostomy in the setting of treatment of likely aspiraiton PNA.  The
   issue of management of his enteral feeding has been a challenge--this
   issue is that PEG tube has had high output with concern for possible
   gastric outlet obstruction.
   1)PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION-
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -CXR with modest improvement in LLL infiltrate predominantly.
   -Will continue to provide suction and secretion clearance
   2)MALNUTRITION-Have been working to establish adequate enteral access
   to allow initiation of enteral feeding.  He has favorable findings of
   stool passage and bowel sounds noted.  The findings on KUB of minimal
   evidence of bowel gas willl require close monitoring going forward.
   -Will continue to follow exam
   -Will continue Reglan to promote motility
   -Follow stool output
   -C. Diff for loose stools
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with septic arthritis and respiratory failure maintained with a tracheostomy. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for likely aspiration pneumonia. The main issue in managing the patient's care is the establishment of adequate enteral access to allow initiation of enteral feeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Pneumonia, aspiration - The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. This is a common complication in patients with impaired swallowing or cough reflexes. The treatment plan includes providing suction and secretion clearance, as well as antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn). Close monitoring will be required to assess the patient's response to treatment.

2. Malnutrition - The patient has been experiencing challenges in establishing adequate enteral access for feeding. Malnutrition can be a serious complication, especially in elderly patients who may already have reduced nutritional reserves. Continuous monitoring of the patient's nutritional status and appropriate measures to provide adequate nutrition should be implemented.

3. Gastric outlet obstruction - The patient's PEG tube has had a high output, raising concerns about possible gastric outlet obstruction. This is a potential complication that needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications such as aspiration or worsening malnutrition.

4. Hypertension - The patient has been noted to have hypertension, but it is described as benign. Regular monitoring of blood pressure will be necessary to ensure it remains within a safe"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS, tracheostomy, and PEG tube placement. He has improved neurologically and continues to improve from a respiratory standpoint. The patient has a history of COPD and is producing large amounts of sputum. His CXR shows decreased opacities on the left side, indicating resolving pneumonia. The patient is currently stable and may start being screened for rehab.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to his history of ARDS and COPD. The production of large amounts of sputum can indicate ongoing respiratory issues.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's tracheostomy and production of sputum, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment as necessary is important.
3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient is currently on antibiotics for HAP, which should be continued for an appropriate duration to prevent recurrence.
4. Sacral ulcer: The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer that appears to be improving. Close monitoring and proper wound care are essential to prevent further complications.
5. Mental status changes: Although the patient's mental status has significantly improved, it should still be monitored for any signs of deterioration.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are stable, but ongoing monitoring is required to ensure adequate oxygen carrying capacity.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS who has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient continues to improve neurologically but still requires respiratory support. There are several potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and requires tracheostomy and respiratory support. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to ongoing production of sputum and underlying COPD.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has had an aspiration event in the past, leading to pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrence, especially with ongoing production of sputum.

3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient is currently on vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP, indicating a previous diagnosis. There is a risk of developing HAP due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures.

4. Sacral ulcer: The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer, which is improving but still requires close monitoring and wound care.

5. Mental status changes: Although the patient's mental status has significantly improved, there is still a risk of further deterioration due to underlying neurological issues.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be addressed by adjusting TPN and providing gentle D5W.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with prolonged hospitalization following ARDS and septic
   arthritis now with slow recovery in terms of ventilatory function but
   with reasonable tolerance of RR 26-28 chronically at this time.  He has
   had most active issue that of needing to establish tolerance of enteral
   feeds--NJ tube placed and have attempted trophic feeds to allow some
   stimulation of gut function in the absence of objective evidence of
   obstruction with continued BM's noted.  In this setting the G-tube
   output has decreased a bit.
   1)Respiratory Failure
HAP vs/+ Aspiration PNA
   -Will have continued TM with suppplemental Oxygen
   -Check ABG to confirm adequate ventilation if continued high RR seen
   -Will maintain trach in place
   -Continue ABX cours
   2)Ileus
Do have decreased G-tube output, Reglan in place, no change in
   abdominal exam
   -Will provide small volume of contrast from J-tube and follow up with
   CT to confirm transit and not frank ileus.
   -TPN to continue until adequate nutritional needs met
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of ARDS and septic arthritis. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing respiratory failure and an ileus. The patient has been receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation and has had a tracheostomy placed. He has also had a G-tube placed for enteral feeding, but the output has decreased recently. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 147/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The main concern is the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Measures such as changing the tracheostomy tube, providing supplemental oxygen, monitoring ABG levels, and continuing antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent or manage this complication.
2) Ileus: The patient's ileus is likely due to his prolonged hospitalization and immobility. It is important to ensure proper nutrition while avoiding complications such as aspiration pneumonia. Small volume contrast studies and a CT scan may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management plan.
3) Malnutrition: The patient's prolonged hospital stay, limited oral intake, and decreased G-tube output indicate a risk of malnutrition. Total"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS, s/p trach and PEG, continues to improve from a
   neurological standpoint, now s/p post-pyloric tube placement due to
   high residuals from PEG tube.
   # Respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia versus HAP versus
   pneumonitis: satting well on trach collar, but producing large amounts
   of sputum, also with low grade temperature and CXR indicative of
   LLL/LUL pna after aspiration event on [**5-3**].  Pt has COPD at baseline.
   CXR from [**5-7**] shows decreased opacities on L side, c/w resolving
   pneumonia.  Patient remains stable and may start to be screened for
   rehab.
   - continue vanc/Zosyn for HAP for eight day course (started [**5-5**])
   - s/p trach [**4-24**]- currently on trach mask
   - bronchodilator inh prn
   - appreciate infectious disease recs
   # S/p gastroc wound flap: Stable. MSSA staph aureas from [**3-14**].
   - per plastics, ROM should be limited to 45 degrees until [**5-9**], then
   increase to 90 degrees until [**5-16**], then full ROM
   - patient will need f/u in plastic surgery clinic 1 week after
   discharge [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7196**]
   - continue Zosyn/vanc as above, then switch back to
   Rifampin/levofloxacin per ID recs
   # FEN:  Patient currently with PEG tube and post-pyloric tube. Will
   wait for tract to mature to advance PEG to J tube- per thoracics,
   maturity of tract requires at least 4 weeks, closer to 6 weeks in
   malnourished patients.  Family wishes not to pursue open J tube
   procedure and wait for tract to mature.  Post-pyloric tube was placed
   on [**5-6**] and tube feeds started. Reglan was started for bowel
   dysmotilitiy.  CT with contrast from N-J tube to rectum.
   - continue Reglan
   - keep PEG tube placed to gravity per thoracic
   # Leukocytosis/low-grade temperature: continue vanc/Zosyn as above and
   continue to monitor.  Pt afebrile overnight.
   # Diarrhea:  C. Diff negative. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ABX and diet.
   # Mental status:  Significantly improved.  Patient is able to move
   distal extremitities and is more interactive than previous.
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Per nursing appears to be improving.
   -dressings as recommended by wound care.
   # Anemia: Hct stable.
   - active T/S
   #Hypernatremia: will decrease sodium concentration in TPN and give
   gentle D5W. Will recheck sodium in afternoon

The patient is also dealing with various medical complications, including respiratory failure, anemia, hypernatremia, and a sacral pressure ulcer.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/50 to 150/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 100.9 kg, and he stands at 73 inches tall.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 9.3 to 11.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level ranging from 7.6 to 24.7 g/dL, platelet count of 223 thousand/mm3, creatinine level ranging from 0.8 to 1.0 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels between 108 and 137 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored due to the risk of aspiration pneumonia, which is evident from the production of large amounts of sputum and low-grade fever. The patient's chest X-ray shows decreased opacities on the left side, indicating resolving pneumonia. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ ARDS, s/p trach and PEG, continues to improve from a
   neurological standpoint, now s/p post-pyloric tube placement due to
   high residuals from PEG tube.
   # Respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia versus HAP versus
   pneumonitis: satting well on trach collar, but producing large amounts
   of sputum, also with low grade temperature and CXR indicative of
   LLL/LUL pna after aspiration event on [**5-3**].  Pt has COPD at baseline.
   CXR from [**5-7**] shows decreased opacities on L side, c/w resolving
   pneumonia.  Patient remains stable and may start to be screened for
   rehab.
   - continue vanc/Zosyn for HAP for eight day course (started [**5-5**])
   - s/p trach [**4-24**]- currently on trach mask
   - bronchodilator inh prn
   - appreciate infectious disease recs
   # S/p gastroc wound flap: Stable. MSSA staph aureas from [**3-14**].
   - per plastics, ROM should be limited to 45 degrees until [**5-9**], then
   increase to 90 degrees until [**5-16**], then full ROM
   - patient will need f/u in plastic surgery clinic 1 week after
   discharge [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7196**]
   - continue Zosyn/vanc as above, then switch back to
   Rifampin/levofloxacin per ID recs
   # FEN:  Patient currently with PEG tube and post-pyloric tube. Will
   wait for tract to mature to advance PEG to J tube- per thoracics,
   maturity of tract requires at least 4 weeks, closer to 6 weeks in
   malnourished patients.  Family wishes not to pursue open J tube
   procedure and wait for tract to mature.  Post-pyloric tube was placed
   on [**5-6**] and tube feeds started. Reglan was started for bowel
   dysmotilitiy.
   - continue Reglan
   - decrease tpn rate gradually as tube feeds are increased. (TPN should
   stop tomorrow)
   - consider contrast study to further evaluate large and small
   bowel
serial KUBs w/ barium vs CT w/ contrast
   - keep PEG tube placed to gravity per thoracic
   # Leukocytosis/low-grade temperature: continue vanc/Zosyn as above and
   continue to monitor
   # Diarrhea:  C. Diff negative. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ABX and diet.
   # Mental status:  Significantly improved.  Patient is able to move
   distal extremitities and is more interactive than previous.
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Per nursing appears to be improving.
   -dressings as recommended by wound care.
   # Anemia: Hct stable.
   - active T/S
   #Hypernatremia: will decrease sodium concentration in TPN and give
   gentle D5W. Will recheck sodium in afternoon

   Code status: dnr/dni
   Disposition: ICU care, rehab screening this week
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with ARDS, tracheostomy, and PEG tube placement. He is currently improving from a neurological standpoint. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, HAP, COPD, and a previous wound infection with MSSA. He also has a gastroc wound flap, and ROM should be limited until further evaluation. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, leukocytosis/low-grade temperature, diarrhea (negative for C. Diff), mental status improvement, grade II sacral ulcer, anemia, hypernatremia, and a previous code status of DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and previous aspiration events may lead to further respiratory issues.
2. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and low-grade temperature suggests a potential infection, which could be bacterial or viral in nature.
3. Diarrhea: Although C. Diff negative, the patient's diarrhea may be related to antibiotics or diet.
4. Mental status changes: Although the patient's mental status has improved, there is still a risk of further neurological deterioration.
5. Sacral ulcer: The grade II sacral ulcer requires ongoing wound care management to prevent complications such as infection or worsening of the ulcer.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are stable, but ongoing monitoring is required to prevent further anemia and its associated complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old man originally presented with infected right prosthetic
   knee, multiple post-operative complication, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] w/
   ARDS, now s/p trach and PEG, continues to improve from a neurological
   standpoint, now s/p post-pyloric tube placement due to high residuals
   from PEG tube.
   # Respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia versus HAP versus
   pneumonitis: satting well on trach collar, but producing large amounts
   of sputum, also with low grade temperature and CXR indicative of
   LLL/LUL pna after aspiration event on [**5-3**].  Pt has COPD at baseline.
   CXR from [**5-7**] shows decreased opacities on L side, c/w resolving
   pneumonia.  Patient remains stable from a respiratory standpoint.
   - continue vanc/Zosyn for HAP for eight day course (started [**5-5**])
   - s/p trach [**4-24**]- currently on trach mask
   - ABG from this morning indicates good oxygenation and ventilation
   (7.45/35/108)
   - bronchodilator inh prn
   - appreciate infectious disease recs
   # S/p gastroc wound flap: Stable. MSSA staph aureas from [**3-14**].
   - per plastics, ROM should be limited to 45 degrees until [**5-9**], then
   increase to 90 degrees until [**5-16**], then full ROM
   - patient will need f/u in plastic surgery clinic 1 week after
   discharge [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7196**]
   - continue Zosyn/vanc as above, then switch back to
   Rifampin/levofloxacin per ID recs
   # FEN:  Patient currently with PEG tube and post-pyloric tube. Will
   wait for tract to mature to advance PEG to J tube- per thoracics,
   maturity of tract requires at least 4 weeks, closer to 6 weeks in
   malnourished patients.  Family wishes not to pursue open J tube
   procedure and wait for tract to mature.  Post-pyloric tube was placed
   on [**5-6**] and tube feeds started. Reglan was started for bowel
   dysmotilitiy.  CT with contrast from N-J tube to rectum, no signs of
   obstruction.
   - continue Reglan
   - keep PEG tube placed to gravity per thoracic
   # Leukocytosis/low-grade temperature: continue vanc/Zosyn as above and
   continue to monitor.  Pt afebrile overnight.
   # Diarrhea:  C. Diff negative. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ABX and diet.
   # Mental status:  Significantly improved.  Patient is able to move
   distal extremitities and is more interactive than previous.
   # Grade II sacral ulcer:  Per nursing appears to be improving.
   -dressings as recommended by wound care.
   # Anemia: Hct somewhat down from yesterday.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of infected right prosthetic knee, multiple post-operative complications, ARDS, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient has been improving from a neurological standpoint and continues to show improvement.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, HAP, and pneumonitis. Although the patient is currently stable on tracheostomy collar, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to ongoing production of sputum and underlying COPD.

2. Infection: The patient has an active infection caused by MSSA Staphylococcus aureus from 3/14. There is a risk of spreading or worsening the infection if proper antibiotics are not administered.

3. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which has been ruled out as Clostridium difficile infection. Other possible causes could include antibiotic-associated diarrhea or dietary factors. It is important to monitor and manage this condition appropriately.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels have decreased, indicating a potential development of anemia. Further investigation and management are required to address this issue.

5. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a grade II sacral ulcer, which appears to be improving. Continuous monitoring and appropriate wound care are necessary to prevent further complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old man originally presented with infected right prosthetic
   knee, multiple post-operative complication, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] w/
   ARDS, now s/p trach and PEG, continues to improve from a neurological
   standpoint, now s/p post-pyloric tube placement due to high residuals
   from PEG tube.
   # Respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia versus HAP versus
   pneumonitis: satting well on trach collar, but producing large amounts
   of sputum, also with low grade temperature and CXR indicative of
   LLL/LUL pna after aspiration event on [**5-3**].  Pt has COPD at baseline.
   CXR from [**5-7**] shows decreased opacities on L side, c/w resolving
   pneumonia.  Patient remains stable from a respiratory standpoint.
   - continue vanc/Zosyn for HAP for eight day course (started [**5-5**])
   - s/p trach [**4-24**]- currently on trach mask
   - ABG from this morning indicates good oxygenation and ventilation
   (7.45/35/108)
   - bronchodilator inh prn
   - appreciate infectious disease recs
   # S/p gastroc wound flap: Stable. MSSA staph aureas from [**3-14**].
   - per plastics, ROM should be limited to 45 degrees until [**5-9**], then
   increase to 90 degrees until [**5-16**], then full ROM
   - patient will need f/u in plastic surgery clinic 1 week after
   discharge [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7196**]
   - continue Zosyn/vanc as above, then switch back to
   Rifampin/levofloxacin per ID recs
   # FEN:  Patient currently with PEG tube and post-pyloric tube. Will
   wait for tract to mature to advance PEG to J tube- per thoracics,
   maturity of tract requires at least 4 weeks, closer to 6 weeks in
   malnourished patients.  Family wishes not to pursue open J tube
   procedure and wait for tract to mature.  Post-pyloric tube was placed
   on [**5-6**] and tube feeds started. Reglan was started for bowel
   dysmotilitiy.  CT with contrast from N-J tube to rectum, no signs of
   obstruction.
   - continue Reglan
   - keep PEG tube placed to gravity per thoracic
   # Leukocytosis/low-grade temperature: continue vanc/Zosyn as above and
   continue to monitor.  Pt afebrile overnight.
   # Diarrhea:  C. Diff negative. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ABX and diet.
   # Mental status:  Significantly improved.  Patient is able to move
   distal extremitities and is more interactive than previous.

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7271**]
 note and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 7272**] has come a long way
   from his ARDS and HAP.  He has a trache and PEG though the latter is
   not functional due to gastric hypomotility, and hence he has required a
   nasal post pyloric feeding tube for the present  for nutrition,  which
   is giving goal rate tube feedings.  Once  his Vanco and Zosyn Rx for
   his pneumonia are finished, he will return to Levo/Rifampin for ongoing
   Rx of his septic prosthetic knee. We believe he is ready for transfer
   to a rehab facility, and following once last RBC transfusion, he is
   scheduled to go to  [**Hospital 7273**] Rehab later today.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of infected right prosthetic knee, multiple post-operative complications, and ARDS. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient has undergone several procedures, including PEG tube placement and post-pyloric tube placement due to high residuals from the PEG tube. He is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and septic prosthetic knee. The patient's mental status has significantly improved, and he is now able to move his distal extremities and interact more. However, he continues to have leukocytosis and low-grade fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation and has a history of ARDS. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if his lungs do not improve or if he develops any new complications.
2. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for HAP and septic prosthetic knee. There is a risk of developing new infections or complications related to his existing infections.
3. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has had gastric hypomotility, resulting in the need for a post-pyloric feeding tube. There is a risk of further gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or malnutrition.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are somewhat down, indicating a possible anemia. Further evaluation and management are required to address"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of ARDS, who has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient continues to improve from a neurological standpoint and has recently had a post-pyloric tube placement due to high residuals from the PEG tube.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and is on a tracheostomy collar. He is producing large amounts of sputum, indicating ongoing respiratory issues. There is also mention of aspiration pneumonia versus hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus pneumonitis. Monitoring for any signs of deterioration in respiratory function is crucial.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium concentration, which needs to be addressed by adjusting the sodium content in the total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and administering D5W. Regular monitoring of sodium levels is essential.

3. Leukocytosis/low-grade temperature: The patient has leukocytosis and low-grade fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Continued monitoring and administration of antibiotics as prescribed are necessary.

4. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, but Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) has been ruled out. Further evaluation may be needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

5. Mental status changes: The"
