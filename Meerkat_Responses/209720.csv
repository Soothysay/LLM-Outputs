","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 99.7 kg male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient's temperature is currently at 101.6Â°F (38.7Â°C), and he has been receiving Hydroxyurea 3000 mg PO TID for 1 day. The patient experienced a spike in temperature while receiving 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and was pan CX. He then received 1 unit of cryoprecipitate.

The patient has no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2108-8-13**] 11:33 PM. The patient is currently on various infusions and other ICU medications, as well as other medications.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/56 mmHg to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) with an irregular S1+S2 and a harsh IV/VI systolic murmur throughout the precordium radiating to the carotids. Physical examination findings are otherwise unremarkable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 159.0 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) at 8.3 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 46 mg/dL, and creatinine (Cr) at 2.8 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated D-dimer at 8897 ng/mL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 5200 IU/L, and normal troponin-T at 0.21 ng/mL. Imaging studies reveal moderate aortic stenosis and symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with normal regional and global biventricular systolic function, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >55%. Blood and urine cultures are negative to date.

Assessment and Plan include alteration in nutrition, atrial fibrillation (AFib), coagulopathy, and leukemia (acute). The patient is on regular diet, receiving D5W with 3 amps bicarb at 100 cc/hr for fluids and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also being provided. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending further evaluation."

   cardioversion admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for urgent plasmapheresis with a
   preliminary diagnosis of AML.
   .
   #AML (unsure if APL, or M3 subtype): Patient s/p plasmaphoresis, s/p
   chemo therapy with hydroxyurea. Hyperviscosity was likely complicating
   both cardiac and renal function. AML complications including tumor
   lysis and DIC and end organ dysfunction with cardiac demand ischemia
   and ARF.
   --f/u oncology notes. Oncology will increase dose of hydroxyurea.
   --Continue to monitor patient for any symptoms relating to
   hyperviscosity syndrome.
    --Follow-up flow and marrow results.

   #DIC: Patient currently has no signs of bleeding. Has increased PT/PTT,
   decreased fibrinogen, increased LDH, High FDPs and high D dimer.
   --check DIC labs every 6 hrs
   --goal for fibrinogen >100, INR>1.5, platelets >50. Give
   crypo/platelets as needed.
   .
   #Tumor lysis: complicated by ARF.
   --tumor lysis labs q6 hr
   --150 meq sodium Bicarb at 150 cc/hr with a goal UOP of >100cc/hr. Use
   furosemide sparingly to diurese.
   --Given dose of Rasburicase 6 mg x1

   # CHF/CV: Patient with BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 8878**] and CXR with cephalization
   suggestive of heart failure.  He is currently asymptomatic without
   dyspnea, orthopnea, chest pain, or PND. The patient also has an
   elevated TnT with flat CK in the setting of acute renal failure, likely
   representing demand ischemia.  One possible etiology is AS and sludging
   from leukostasis leading to demand ischemia and failure.  Another
   possible etiology is sludging leading to pulmonary emboli causing right
   heart failure and atrial fibrillation with CXR without significant
   pulmonary edema. ECG showing ST elevations in V1-V3.
   - Rasburicase, IVF, leukopheresis as above.
   - Lasix if patient develops volume overload
   - TTE and LENIs. Hold off on anticoagulation for now.
   - Rule out ACS with serial cardiac biomarkers and repeat ECG.
   - obtain old EKG.
   - Continue metoprolol and ASA

   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline. Possible etiologies include
   ARF from tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output
   (less likely).
   - Trend creatinine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of prostate cancer on lupron therapy, GERD, and past atrial fibrillation (afib) who was admitted for urgent plasmapheresis with a preliminary diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 

The patient has been treated with chemotherapy using hydroxyurea and plasmapheresis due to hyperviscosity syndrome. However, complications have arisen including tumor lysis syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure (ARF), and atrial fibrillation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Hyperviscosity syndrome: This can lead to cardiac and renal dysfunction.
2. Tumor lysis syndrome: It can cause acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient is at risk for further tumor lysis due to the ongoing chemotherapy.
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): It can result in bleeding or clotting complications throughout the body. Monitoring of coagulation parameters is essential to prevent or manage these complications.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): It may be due to tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures taken to support kidney function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer on lupron therapy, GERD, and past atrial fibrillation.
- He was admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis with a preliminary diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
- The patient underwent plasmapheresis and chemotherapy with hydroxyurea.
- He experienced hyperviscosity syndrome, which complicated both cardiac and renal function.
- There are concerns about potential complications such as tumor lysis syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure.
- The patient has an increased risk for bleeding due to low fibrinogen levels, prolonged PT/PTT, and elevated D-dimer.
- There is evidence of demand ischemia and right heart failure.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, possibly due to tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output.
- Anemia is likely secondary to AML.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is not currently anticoagulated.
- Other medical conditions include GERD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor lysis syndrome: This can lead to acute renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): This can result in widespread bleeding"

AML complications including tumor lysis syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and end organ dysfunction with resolved cardiac demand ischemia and acute renal failure (ARF) have been observed.

The patient developed fever while receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion and complains of a sore throat. Cultures have been obtained, and the patient is started on cefepime and vancomycin for prophylaxis.

The patient also has signs of bleeding, increased PT/PTT, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high fibrin degradation products (FDPs), and high D-dimer, indicating DIC. DIC labs are checked every 6 hours, and the goal for fibrinogen is >100 mg/dL, INR >1.5, and platelets >20. Cryoprecipitate and platelets are given as needed.

Tumor lysis syndrome complicated by ARF is also"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of prostate cancer, GERD, and past atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis with a preliminary diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient underwent chemotherapy with hydroxyurea and experienced complications such as tumor lysis syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), along with end-organ dysfunction including cardiac and renal involvement.

The patient's current conditions include electrolyte and fluid disorder, alteration in nutrition, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), coagulopathy, and leukemia (AML). The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs), suggesting ongoing DIC.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to leukemia and chemotherapy increases the risk of infections, especially since he has a Group B streptococcus infection in his urine culture.

2. Bleeding: With coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, the patient is at an increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient"

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 8877**] is a 77 year old gentleman with a PMH
   significant for prostate CA on lupron therapy, GERD, and past afib s/p
   cardioversion admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for urgent plasmapheresis with a
   preliminary diagnosis of AML.
   .
   #AML with blasts, monocytic subtype on bone marrow: Patient s/p
   plasmaphoresis, s/p chemo therapy with hydroxyurea. Hyperviscosity was
   likely complicating both cardiac and renal function. WBC trending
   towards normal levels s/p 4 treatment with hydroxyurea. AML
   complications included tumor lysis and DIC and end organ dysfunction
   with resolved cardiac demand ischemia and ARF.
   --f/u oncology notes. Oncology will hold on hydroxyurea today.
    --Obtain records about baseline CBC/chemistries from OSH
   .
   #UTI/fever: Patient had a fever while getting FFP transfusion. Patient
   has Group B streptococcus in urine culture. Patient is essentially
   neutropenic, so will treat for prophylaxis also.
   --Continue cefepime (started [**8-14**]) and vanco (started [**8-14**]) for
   prophylaxis.
   --f/u blood culture
   --f/u CXR results in AM
   #DIC: Patient currently has no signs of bleeding. Resolved DIC. Has
   increased PT/PTT, increased LDH, High FDPs and high D dimer.
   --check DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
   --goal for fibrinogen >100, INR<1.5, platelets >10. Give
   crypo/platelets as needed.
   .
   #Tumor lysis: complicated by ARF. Problem resolved.
   --tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 7**].
   -- UOP of >100cc/hr, so will continue fluids at D51/2 NS @ 100 cc/hr.
   --Given dose of Rasburicase 6 mg x1
   --Continue allopurinol.
    # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline. Possible etiologies include
   ARF from tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output
   (less likely). FeNa=2.9%, FeUrea=33%, so likely not pre-renal.  Likely
   a chronic component also.
   - Trend creatinine. Resolving.
   - Continue fluids of D51/2 NS @ 100 cc/hr.
   - Obtain OSH labs for baseline Cr.
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to AML. Resolved
   - Trend CBC, transfuse for hct<25.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # CHF/CV: Patient with BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 8924**] and CXR with cephalization
   suggestive of heart failure.  He is currently asymptomatic without
   dyspnea, orthopnea, chest pain, or PND. The patient also has an
   elevated TnT with flat CK in the setting of acute renal failure, likely
   representing demand ischemia.  One possible etiology is AS and sludging
   from leukostasis leading to demand ischemia and failure.  Another
   possible etiology is sludging leading to pulmonary emboli causing right
   heart failure and atrial fibrillation with CXR without significant
   pulmonary edema. ECG showing ST elevations in V1-V3.
   - Rasburicase, IVF, leukopheresis as above.
   - Lasix if patient develops volume overload
   - Continue metoprolol.
   - D/C
ed ASA because low platelets.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Not currently anticoagulated.
   - Continue metoprolol with goal HR 80-100.
   - Hold anticoagulation for now.
   .
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   .
   # HTN: Hold lisinopril given ARF. Continue metoprolol as above.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold statin.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, GERD, and atrial fibrillation.
- He was admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis with a preliminary diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
- The patient underwent plasmapheresis and chemotherapy with hydroxyurea. Hyperviscosity likely complicated both cardiac and renal function.
- The patient's white blood cell count is trending towards normal levels after treatment with hydroxyurea.
- AML complications included tumor lysis syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and end-organ dysfunction with resolved cardiac demand ischemia and acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient had a fever during a fresh frozen plasma transfusion, and Group B streptococcus was found in his urine culture. He is essentially neutropenic, so he will be treated for prophylaxis with antibiotics.
- The patient has increased PT/PTT, increased LDH, high fibrin degradation products, and high D-dimer levels, indicating resolved DIC.
- The patient's tumor lysis syndrome complicated by ARF has been resolved.
- The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output. He is being given fluids and medications to manage this condition.
- The patient's anemia is likely secondary to AML"

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  77 yo M with prostate ca, gerd, remote a-fib
   post cardioversion presented with AML blast crisis c/b ARF (cr 2.8),
   elevated BNP, demand ischemia, atrial fib in setting of hyperviscosity,
   and DIC. He remains on antbx for functional neutropenia with recent
   fever.  He required no additional product/blood transfusions yesterday
   and has no signs of active bleeding.

   Urine cx: group b strep
   Agree with plan to continue allopurinol, following electrolytes.  His
   acute tumor lysis has resolved.  Will switch his IVF to maintenance,
   given poor po intake, monitoring his u/o closely. His counts are
   dropping post hydrea.  Additional chemo regimen per onc team.. He has
   functional neutropenia and in setting of recent fever will continue
   neutropenic coverage with vanco/cefepime day 2, following remaining cx
   data.  Vanco adequately covers his pos urine for group b strep. Will
   check repeat cxr as well given c/o cough, though he remains stable from
   respiratory standpoint on 2L NC.  His DIC has resolved and he shows no
   signs of active bleeding.  We continue to follow [**Hospital1 7**] DIC labs.  Will
   maintain plts > 10.  ARF is most likely from tumor lysis vs
   microvascular thrombosis from DIC vs atn.  We do not know his baseline
   fx.  We continue to renally dose meds.  His phos is trending down and
   he is maintaining good urine outpt.  Will assess OSH records for
   baseline labs.
   ICU: boots, PPI, Phoresis cath, PIVs, nutrition consider picc line
   placement.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.
   Pt is stable for transfer to BMT service.

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of prostate cancer, GERD, and past atrial fibrillation. He presented with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blast crisis and was admitted for urgent plasmapheresis. The patient underwent chemotherapy with hydroxyurea, which led to hyperviscosity syndrome and complications such as tumor lysis syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and acute renal failure (ARF). 

The patient's current conditions include electrolyte and fluid disorder, alteration in nutrition, atrial fibrillation (AF), coagulopathy, and leukemia. He is also at risk for complications such as urinary tract infection (UTI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1Â°C (100.6Â°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with irregular rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 114/61 mmHg to 128/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals an irregularly irregular heartbeat, crackles at the lung bases, and no significant abnormalities in the abdomen or neurologic exam.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 4.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of"

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 8877**] is a 77 year old gentleman with a PMH
   significant for prostate CA on lupron therapy, GERD, and past afib s/p
   cardioversion admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for urgent plasmapheresis with a
   preliminary diagnosis of AML.
   .
   #AML with blasts, monocytic subtype on bone marrow: Patient s/p
   plasmaphoresis, s/p chemo therapy with hydroxyurea. Hyperviscosity was
   likely complicating both cardiac and renal function. WBC trending
   towards normal levels s/p 4 treatment with hydroxyurea. AML
   complications including tumor lysis and DIC and end organ dysfunction
   with resolved cardiac demand ischemia and ARF.
   --f/u oncology notes. Oncology will hold on hydroxyurea today.
   --Continue to monitor patient for any symptoms relating to
   hyperviscosity syndrome.
    --Obtain records about baseline CBC/chemistries from OSH
   .
   #Fever: Patient had a fever while getting FFP transfusion. Also
   complains of a sore throat today.
   --f/u cultures
   --Will start cefepime (started [**8-14**]) and vanco (started [**8-14**]) for
   prophylaxis.
   #DIC: Patient currently has no signs of bleeding. Has increased PT/PTT,
   increased LDH, High FDPs and high D dimer.
   --check DIC labs every 6 hrs
   --goal for fibrinogen >100, INR>1.5, platelets >20. Give
   crypo/platelets as needed.
   .
   #Tumor lysis: complicated by ARF.
   --tumor lysis labs q6 hr
   --150 meq sodium Bicarb at 150 cc/hr with a goal UOP of >100cc/hr. Use
   furosemide sparingly to diurese.
   --Given dose of Rasburicase 6 mg x1
    # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline. Possible etiologies include
   ARF from tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output
   (less likely). FeNa=2.9%, FeUrea=33%, so likely not pre-renal.
   - Trend creatinine
   - D5 with 3 amps of Bicarb at 100.
   - Onc recommends renal consult if thinking about dialysis.
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to AML.
   - Trend CBC, transfuse for hct<25.
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # CHF/CV: Patient with BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 8924**] and CXR with cephalization
   suggestive of heart failure.  He is currently asymptomatic without
   dyspnea, orthopnea, chest pain, or PND. The patient also has an
   elevated TnT with flat CK in the setting of acute renal failure, likely
   representing demand ischemia.  One possible etiology is AS and sludging
   from leukostasis leading to demand ischemia and failure.  Another
   possible etiology is sludging leading to pulmonary emboli causing right
   heart failure and atrial fibrillation with CXR without significant
   pulmonary edema. ECG showing ST elevations in V1-V3.
   - Rasburicase, IVF, leukopheresis as above.
   - Lasix if patient develops volume overload
   - Continue metoprolol.
   - Will D/C ASA.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Not currently anticoagulated.
   - Continue metoprolol with goal HR 80-100.
   - Hold anticoagulation for now.
   .
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   .
   # HTN: Hold lisinopril given ARF. Continue metoprolol as above.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold statin.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis with a preliminary diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient has undergone chemotherapy with hydroxyurea and plasmapheresis. 

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, and chloride levels.

2. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient has poor oral intake.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing an irregular heartbeat.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has increased PT/PTT, increased LDH, high FDPs, and high D-dimer levels, indicating a possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

5. Leukemia, Acute (ALL, AML, Cancer, Malignant Neoplasm): The patient has been diagnosed with AML and is currently undergoing treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hyperviscosity syndrome: Due to the patient's high white blood cell count, there is a risk of hyperviscosity syndrome, which can affect cardiac and renal function.

2. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient is at risk for tumor lysis syndrome, which can lead to acute renal failure.

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC"
