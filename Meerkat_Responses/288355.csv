   Assessment and Plan
   83M with multiple metastatic primary cancers who p/w mental status
   changes, found to be hypoglycemic, intubated in ED for increased work
   of breathing.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 intubated for
increased
   WOB
 in ED. No ABG performed so unable to assess if pt was actually
   ever hypoxic. I suspected this was all related to hypoglycemia
   -          ddx for presumed hypoxia would include PE, PNA, PTX, CNS
   depression, cardiac ischemia, all ruled out as follows:
   -          serum tox negative (Utox positive for BZD, but likely from
   ER sedation)
   -          CT head was negative for acute process
   -          no e/o acute cardiac ischemia on repeat EKG this AM,
   trending 3^rd set of enzymes (2 negative), previous Q waves in V2
   resolved and appear to be related to lead placement
   -          no PTX seen on CXR
   -          afebrile and without clinical hx of PNA but will cover for
   now with vanc/levo/flagyl (flagly in case abdominal source)
   -          send sputum for culture
   -          if no positive cx by Saturday would d/c all antibiotics
   -          ABGs look excellent
   -          decrease FiO2, change to PSV, obtain RSBI, wean sedation, do
   SBT
   -          would extubate today if RSBI and SBT acceptable
 HYPOTENSION
 Resolved. Seems to have been transient and fluid
   responsive, so not true shock
   -          could have been contribution from peri-intubation sedation
   vs. depressed CNS function from hypoglycemia
   -          of note, arterial pressures noted to be 20 points higher
   than cuff pressures
   -          if early sepsis, covering with vanc/levo/flagyl as above for
   pulmonary and bowel source coverage
   -          would d/c antibiotics as above if no culture growth
   -          added on cortisol to pre-solumedrol labs from ED but doubt
   relative adrenal insufficiency
   -          maintain glucose control but caution as pt p/w hypoglycemia
   -          Easily weaned off  of levophed
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER)
   -          seen by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1055**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 123**] as [**Last Name (LF) 267**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] contact today
 DIABETES [**Name (NI) 1060**] (DM), TYPE II
   -          not on home insulin, but presented to ED with FSG in 20
   -          could be due to inappropriate home use of oral hypoglycemic
   vs. liver synthetic dysfunction.
   -          Investigate further after extubation and arrival of family
   -          FSG q4h given hypoglycemia
   -          Cover with  non-aggressive RISS
 PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS
   -          Previous decision not to anticoagulate in setting of
   extensive metastatic disease, will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 123**], and
   potentially with hepatology
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
 chronically low, improved
   to 131 this AM
   -          hypervolemic hyponatremia
   -          unable to aggressively fluid restrict or give lasix or other
   diuretics given tenuous status
   -          low Na diet when eating
   -          [**Hospital1 **] lytes
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   -          continue levothyroxine
   -          no need to check TFTs in ICU setting
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB) - per [**Hospital1 267**] onc
   record, pt was due to have colonoscopy today. Known guaiac positive
   from last admission.
   -          PPI daily
   -          [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   -          d/w onc further indications for colonoscopy
 Coagulopathy
   -          INR elevated, likely [**1-10**] liver disease and malnutrition
   -          Would keep 1.5-2.0
   -          Consider vitamin K if >2.0

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple metastatic primary cancers who presented with mental status changes, hypoglycemia, and respiratory failure. He was intubated in the emergency department due to increased work of breathing. The patient's current condition is stable, with satisfactory positions of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. He is being treated for suspected pneumonia and sepsis with antibiotics, and his vital signs are within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated for respiratory failure, although it is not specified as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Monitoring and weaning off sedation will be important to assess readiness for extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension, which resolved and is believed to be fluid responsive. It may be related to peri-intubation sedation or depressed CNS function from hypoglycemia.
3. Sepsis: The patient is being covered for potential sepsis with antibiotics due to suspected pneumonia and bowel source infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and lab results is necessary.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient presented with FSG in the emergency department, indicating possible uncontrolled diabetes. Further investigation is needed after extubation.
5. Portal Vein Thrombosis: The patient has a history of portal vein thrombosis and previous decisions regarding antico"

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple metastatic primary cancers who presented to the emergency department with mental status changes and was intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of hypoglycemia, diabetes type II, liver dysfunction, hypothyroidism, upper gastrointestinal bleed, coagulopathy, and chronic hyponatremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are easily weaned off levophed. The patient is sedated but follows simple commands and denies any pain or discomfort. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for increased work of breathing and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator will be assessed based on respiratory system compliance and ability to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. Infection: The patient is covered with antibiotics due to suspected sepsis, and sputum culture has been sent. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleed and is on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for prophylaxis. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory values, especially coagulation parameters, is necessary to detect any signs of bleeding.

4. Diabetes management: The patient has diabetes type II and was found hypoglycemic. Tight glucose control is crucial to prevent both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Regular insulin sliding scale is ordered for glycemic control.

5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function is compromised, which may contribute to hypoglycemia and coagulopathy. Monitoring liver enzymes and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is important.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient has chronic hyponatremia that needs to be corrected carefully due to the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Close monitoring of serum sodium levels and fluid balance is necessary.

7. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and thyroid function tests are not routinely checked in the ICU setting. Thyroxine levels should be monitored periodically.

8. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR likely due to liver disease and malnutrition. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and consideration of vitamin K administration if INR is >2.0 are important.

9. Restraints: The patient requires frequent reevaluation for the need of restraints to ensure patient safety and comfort.

10. Communication: Efforts have been made to contact the patient's family, but no one is available. A social worker consult may be necessary to establish a healthcare power of attorney after the patient is extubated."

   Assessment and Plan
   83-year-old man with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unclear and possibly
   multiple primaries, now with respiratory failure of uncertain
   etiology.  History is quite limited at present.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   Likely related to hypoglycemia.  Mental status appears good this
   morning off sedation.  Will investigate further if not clear once
   extubated.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Appears to be doing well on 5/0/0.4 now.
   Now awake and following simple commands
   Trial of spontaneous breathing and potential extubation trial today.
 SHOCK --> HYPOTENSION
   Vasodilatory reaction after sedation used with intubation seems most
   likely, although PE and sepsis are possible.  His improvement suggests
   that the process was transient, arguing for the former.  We will
   continue antibiotics until cultures negative x 72 hours.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER)
   No acute intervention.  Discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
   Improving
 HYPOGLYCEMIA
   Resolved.  [**Month (only) 60**] be related to a report of starting an oral hypoglycemic,
   although we have been unable to corroborate.
 PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS
   Will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 123**], and potentially with hepatology
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   -FSBS and insulin sliding scale
 MINIMAL HISTORY
   If we extubate him successfully, will obtain additional history from
   him.  If not, we will consult social work for help locating his family.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma, unclear and possibly multiple primaries. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure of uncertain etiology, altered mental status likely related to hypoglycemia, shock/hypotension, cancer (liver), hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, portal vein thrombosis, type II diabetes mellitus, minimal history, and possible GI bleed with melena.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires invasive ventilation, which carries risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various causes like hypoglycemia, sepsis, or drug effects. If not addressed, it may progress to severe confusion, disorientation, or even coma.
3. Shock/Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to vasodilatory reaction, pulmonary embolism (PE), or sepsis. If not managed promptly, it may lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.
4. Cancer (Liver): The patient's hepatic masses and portal vein thrombosis indicate advanced liver disease. Complications like liver failure, further thrombosis, or hepatic encephalopathy may arise.

   chemotherapy at this time because of poor performance status
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
   Patient most likely has appropriately increased ADH in setting of
   cirrhosis.
   -          monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -          fluid restrict to 1500ml free water
   -          could diurese if hyponatremia worsens

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of presumed hepatocellular carcinoma and possible second malignancy. He was admitted for mental status change in the setting of hypoglycemia, complicated by episodes of respiratory distress. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, hypoglycemia/diabetes, hypotension, cancer (malignant neoplasm), hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, gastrointestinal bleed, coagulopathy, and portal vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary edema and known left hemidiaphragm paralysis. He is being treated with nitro paste, lasix, oxygen, and morphine if needed. Close monitoring of respiratory status will be done.
2. Hypoglycemia/Diabetes: The patient was on a secretagogue at home but has become hypoglycemic during admission. His impaired hepatic clearance and compromised gluconeogenesis secondary to metastatic disease may contribute to this condition. Discontinuation of SSI and monitoring glucose every two hours will be done.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had prolonged hypotension after receiving sedating medications. Given his liver disease, this response is expected. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will continue until Saturday to cover possible pulmonary or bowel sources, unless cultures are negative.
4. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm): The patient most likely has hepatocellular carcinoma with possible metastatic colorectal cancer. Oncology recommendations have been appreciated, and a colonoscopy will be deferred until more stability is achieved.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, likely due to increased ADH in the setting of cirrhosis. Monitoring of electrolytes will be done, and fluid restriction to 1500 ml free water will be implemented. Diuretics may be used if hyponatremia worsens.
6. Hypothyroidism: This is a new diagnosis, so it is not necessary to check thyroid function tests until six weeks after initiation of therapy. Levothyroxine will continue to be administered.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient had guaiac positive stool in the emergency department, indicating possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding will be conducted.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient has secondary liver metastases leading to coagulopathy. Vitamin K may be given if INR is greater than 2.
9. Portal Vein Thrombosis: Chronic portal vein thrombosis will be monitored.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation may be required for accurate assessments."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of mental status change, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. The patient was previously intubated but has now been extubated. He is taking prandin 1mg three times a day at home and did not start a diet due to the risk of aspiration. The patient's allergies are unknown, and he has been receiving antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 111/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,651 mL with 229 mL output, resulting in a positive balance of 591 mL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals marked jaundice with scleral icterus, clear tearing from the eyes, oriented and pleasant, and good air movement in the lungs with some crackles at the bases. Extremities are warm with good distal pulses. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated bilirubin levels, low hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Liver enzymes are significantly elevated, and kidney function tests show some abnormalities. Blood glucose levels are low, indicating hypoglycemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo gentleman with presumed hepatocellular carcinoma with possible
   second malignancy admitted for mental status change in setting of
   hypoglycemia complicated by episodes of respiratory distress.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Clinically in pulmonary edema this morning.  Other contributing factors
   to poor respiratory status include known L hemidiaphragm paralysis.
   Unclear why he is going into pulmonary edema.  EKG and cardiac enzymes
   have been negative.
   -          treat acutely with nitro paste, lasix, oxygen; would add
   morphine if needed
   -          follow respiratory status closely during day
   -          f/u final CXR read (my read, no pneumothorax)
   -          note that episode occurred after getting levofloxacin this
   morning; monitor for correlation with levofloxacin dosing
   -          patient is s/p extubation [**1-29**] and is currently full code
 HYPOGLYCEMIA / DIABETES
   Patient was on secretogogue at home in setting of impaired hepatic
   clearance as well as possibly compromised hepatic gluconeogenesis
   secondary to metastatic disease.  He has become hypoglycemic during
   admission despite not getting any insulin.
   -          discontinue SSI and monitor glucose Q2H
   -          appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] input about short and long term management
   options
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -          in setting of intubation in the ED; note that patients with
   liver disease can have marked and prolonged hypotension after receiving
   sedating medications
   -          given difficulties obtaining clear medical history from
   patient and family, will continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   (vanc/levo/flagyl) until Saturday to cover possible pulmonary or bowel
   source; if cultures negative Sat, will stop antibiotics
   -          currently hypertensive
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER)
   Most likely has HCC, but atypical histology suggestive of possible
   metastatic colorectal cancer.
   -          appreciate oncology recs
   -          will defer colonoscopy until more stable
   -          family and patient aware that he is not candidate for
   chemotherapy at this time because of poor performance status
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
   Patient most likely has appropriately increased ADH in setting of
   cirrhosis.
   -          monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -          fluid restrict to 1500ml free water
   -          could diurese if hyponatremia worsens
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   -          note that this is new diagnosis from early [**Month (only) 1088**]; hence
   no utility to checking TFTs until 6 weeks after initiation of therapy
   -          continue levothyroxine
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   -          noted to have guaiac positive stool in ED
   -          no BMs in last 24 hours, Hct has been stable
   -          monitor
   # Coagulopathy
   -          secondary to liver metastases
   -          would give vitamin K for INR > 2

   note reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that Mr. [**Known lastname 1094**] was
   extubated yesterday and that he met with oncology to discuss tumor and
   prognosis; he reamins full code at present.  This morning, he reportes
   no pain, but did sleep poorly overnight.  In addition, he had
   borderline hypoglycemia this morning.  Finally, he had an episode of
   acute dyspnea this morning that appeared to be acute pulmonary edema.
   It occurred in the setting of a fluid load (with IV metronidazole), and
   responded to diuresis.  We will continue diuresis and add beta blockade
   for diatolic CHF today; we will also ask endocrine to see him given
   persistent hypoglycemia: could this be an insulin-secreting tumor?  His
   presenting issues (altered mental status leading to intubation and
   hypotension) have resolved and appear to have been related to acute
   hypoglycemia.  Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 512**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of presumed hepatocellular carcinoma and possible second malignancy. He was admitted for mental status change in the setting of hypoglycemia, complicated by episodes of respiratory distress. The patient is currently full code and has a critical condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced episodes of respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. It is important to closely monitor his respiratory status and provide appropriate treatment, including oxygen, diuretics, and possibly morphine if needed.

2. Hypoglycemia/Diabetes: The patient is on a secretagogue at home due to impaired hepatic clearance and compromised gluconeogenesis from metastatic disease. He has become hypoglycemic during admission despite not receiving insulin. Discontinuing the SSI and monitoring glucose every 2 hours is recommended.

3. Hypotension (Not Shock): The patient's prolonged hypotension after receiving sedating medications should be closely monitored, especially in the setting of liver disease. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued until Saturday to cover possible pulmonary or bowel source.

4. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Hepatic (Liver): The patient most likely has hepatocellular carcinoma, with possible metastatic colorectal cancer. Oncology recommendations have been discussed, and a colonoscopy will be deferred until more stability is achieved.

5. Hyponatremia (Low Sodium, Hyposmolarity): The patient most likely has appropriately increased ADH in the setting of cirrhosis. Fluid restriction to 1500 mL free water is recommended, and diuresis may be considered if hyponatremia worsens.

6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a new diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine should be continued, and thyroid function tests should be monitored.

7. Gastrointestinal Bleed, Upper (Melena, GI Bleed, GIB): The patient has guaiac-positive stool in the ED, but no bleeding has been observed recently. Monitoring is recommended.

8. Coagulopathy: Secondary to liver metastases, coagulopathy is present. Vitamin K may be given for INR > 2.

9. Portal Vein Thrombosis: Chronic portal vein thrombosis should be monitored.

10. ICU Care: Nutrition should be provided, and a speech and swallow evaluation is necessary. Glycemic control should be maintained, and lines, prophylaxis, and communication should be managed accordingly."

","The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU intubated and hypotensive after presenting with altered mental status. The patient's condition was presumed to be due to hypoglycemia. The patient has a history of cancer, specifically malignant neoplasm of the liver, hypothyroidism, type II diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal bleed, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/53 to 147/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for poor sleep overnight. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 372 to 464 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, troponin-T level of less than 0.01, glucose level ranging from 52 to 65 mg/dL, and liver enzyme levels elevated. 

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice and warm skin. 

The patient's current medications include dextrose 50%, pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), Flagyl, levofloxacin, synthroid, PPI, and subcutaneous heparin and insulin. 

The patient's medical history, social history, and family history remain unchanged from admission except as noted above. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, hypotension, hepatic dysfunction due to the underlying liver cancer, electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia, and potential infections due to the presence of an arterial line and multi-lumen catheter."

   CHEST, ONE VIEW:  Comparison with [**2105-1-29**].  The patient has been
   extubated. There are low lung volumes with bilateral lower lobe
   atelectasis and probable right small pleural effusion.  There is a
   large amount of air in the stomach. Cardiac contour is difficult to
   assess due to low lung volumes; however, the mediastinal and hilar
   contours appear approximately similar.  There is no evidence of
   pulmonary edema.  Osseous structures appear unchanged.
   IMPRESSION:  Very low lung volumes with associated atelectasis and
   small right pleural effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo gentleman with presumed hepatocellular carcinoma with possible
   second malignancy admitted for mental status change in setting of
   hypoglycemia, ICU course complicated by episodes of proabable flash
   pulmonary edema.
 Pulmonary Edema
 recurred overnight with precipitant likely
   uncontrolled HTN . EKG and cardiac enzymes have been negative.
   -          Improve control of SBP to <140, consider re-instituting
   short acting ACE vs. beta blocker
   -          treat any episodes acutely with nitro paste, lasix, oxygen;
   morphine
 HYPOGLYCEMIA / DIABETES
   Patient was on secretogogue at home in setting of impaired hepatic
   clearance as well as possibly compromised hepatic gluconeogenesis
   secondary to metastatic disease.  He has become hypoglycemic during
   admission despite not getting any insulin, however has also become
   hyperglycemic without insulin
   -          regular ISS, monitor glucose Q4H, give D50 prn
   -          f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
 HYPERTENSION -
   -          was as high as 200
s last night, precipitating decreased LV
   compliance and pulmonary edema
   -          will give 5mg IV metoprolol this AM, consider longer lasting
   coverage with po metoprolol
 ARF
 Cr bumped to 1.2 today, was 0.6 on admission
   -          ddx includes prerenal failure due to ineffective
   intravascular volume but this is less likely given episodes of
   pulmonary edema reflecting intravascularly replete state
   -          more likely related to ATN from prei-intubation hypotension
   -          will send urine lytes to calculate FeUrea as pt has been
   receiving lasix
   -          trend Cr
   -          avoid nephrotoxins so will avoid ACE-I
s for BP control
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER)
   Most likely has HCC, but atypical histology suggestive of possible
   metastatic colorectal cancer.
   -          appreciate oncology recs
   -          deferring colonoscopy until more stable
   -          ? if family and patient aware that he is not candidate for
   chemotherapy at this time because of poor performance status, will try
   to readdress today
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
   Stable. Patient most likely has appropriately increased ADH in setting
   of cirrhosis.
   -          monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -          fluid restrict to 1500ml free water
   -          could diurese if hyponatremia worsens
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   -          note that this is new diagnosis from early [**Month (only) 1088**]; hence
   no utility to checking TFTs until 6 weeks after initiation of therapy
   -          continue levothyroxine
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   -          noted to have guaiac positive stool in ED
   -          no BMs in last 24 hours, Hct has been stable
   -          monitor HCT daily unless clinically bleeding
   # Coagulopathy
 worsening today
   -          likely secondary to liver metastases and poor synthetic
   function, but could be a nutritional component
   -          give vitamin K again today as INR rising, now > 2, will give
   3 day course (last day [**2-1**])
   -          no evidence for DIC, platelets stable, pt not septic
   -          trend daily

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old gentleman with a history of presumed hepatocellular carcinoma and possible second malignancy. He was admitted for mental status change in the setting of hypoglycemia. The ICU course has been complicated by episodes of probable flash pulmonary edema.

The patient has experienced several medical complications during his stay in the ICU. These include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient had episodes of pulmonary edema, which recurred overnight with a precipitant likely uncontrolled hypertension. EKG and cardiac enzymes have been negative.

2. Hypoglycemia/Diabetes: The patient was on a secretagogue at home due to impaired hepatic clearance and possibly compromised hepatic gluconeogenesis secondary to metastatic disease. He became hypoglycemic during admission despite not receiving any insulin but also became hyperglycemic without insulin.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was as high as 200, precipitating decreased left ventricular compliance and pulmonary edema. It is planned to give 5 mg IV metoprolol this morning and consider longer-lasting coverage with oral metoprolol.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.2 today from 0.6 on admission. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal failure due to ineffective intravascular volume, but this is less likely given episodes of pulmonary"

   extubated. There are low lung volumes with bilateral lower lobe
   atelectasis and probable right small pleural effusion.  There is a
   large amount of air in the stomach. Cardiac contour is difficult to
   assess due to low lung volumes; however, the mediastinal and hilar
   contours appear approximately similar.  There is no evidence of
   pulmonary edema.  Osseous structures appear unchanged.

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo gentleman with presumed hepatocellular carcinoma with possible
   second malignancy admitted for mental status change in setting of
   hypoglycemia, ICU course complicated by episodes of proabable flash
   pulmonary edema.
 Pulmonary Edema
 recurred overnight with precipitant likely
   uncontrolled HTN . EKG and cardiac enzymes have been negative.
   -          Improve control of SBP to <140
   -          treat episodes acutely with nitro paste, lasix, oxygen;
   morphine
   -          patient is s/p extubation [**1-29**] and is currently full code
 HYPOGLYCEMIA / DIABETES
   Patient was on secretogogue at home in setting of impaired hepatic
   clearance as well as possibly compromised hepatic gluconeogenesis
   secondary to metastatic disease.  He has become hypoglycemic during
   admission despite not getting any insulin.
   -          no SSI, monitor glucose Q2H, give D50 prn
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -          in setting of intubation in the ED; note that patients with
   liver disease can have marked and prolonged hypotension after receiving
   sedating medications
   -          there does not appear to be a septic etiology so antibiotics

   -          currently hypertensive
 ARF
 Cr bumped to 1.2 today, was 0.6 on admission
   -          ddx includes prerenal failure due to ineffective
   intravascular volume but this is less likely given episodes of
   pulmonary edema
   -          could also be ATN from prei-intubation hypotension
   -          will send urine lytes to calculate FeUrea as pt has been
   receiving lasix
   -          trend Cr [**Hospital1 **]
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER)
   Most likely has HCC, but atypical histology suggestive of possible
   metastatic colorectal cancer.
   -          appreciate oncology recs
   -          deferring colonoscopy until more stable
   -          ? if family and patient aware that he is not candidate for
   chemotherapy at this time because of poor performance status, will try
   to readdress today
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
   Patient most likely has appropriately increased ADH in setting of
   cirrhosis.
   -          monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -          fluid restrict to 1500ml free water
   -          could diurese if hyponatremia worsens
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   -          note that this is new diagnosis from early [**Month (only) 1088**]; hence
   no utility to checking TFTs until 6 weeks after initiation of therapy
   -          continue levothyroxine
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   -          noted to have guaiac positive stool in ED
   -          no BMs in last 24 hours, Hct has been stable
   -          monitor HCT daily unless clinically bleeding
   # Coagulopathy
 worsening today
   -          likely secondary to liver metastases and poor synthetic
   function, but could be a nutritional component
   -          give vitamin K again today as INR > 2
   # Portal Vein Thrombosis
   -          Chronic, monitor

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of presumed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and possible second malignancy. He was admitted for mental status change in the setting of hypoglycemia. His ICU course has been complicated by episodes of probable flash pulmonary edema. The patient's EKG and cardiac enzymes have been negative.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 90 bpm (normal range 78-123 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 102/51 mmHg to 204/157 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (normal range 14-33 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on 6L nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed chronic illness appearance, jaundice, poor dentition, normal heart sounds with a systolic murmur, clear anterior lungs with diminished sounds at bilateral bases and fine crackles, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.6 mg/dL on admission to 1.2 mg/dL today. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for low sodium and potassium levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo gentleman with presumed hepatocellular carcinoma with possible
   second malignancy admitted for mental status change in setting of
   hypoglycemia, ICU course complicated by episodes of proabable flash
   pulmonary edema.
 Pulmonary Edema
 recurred again yesterday, unclear precipitant (HTN
   vs. ACS)
   -          Goal to improve control of SBP to <140, will increase beta
   blocker today to 50mg tid
   -          Will add afterload reduction with hydralazine (can
t give
   ACE-I due to ARF) if increasing BB is not effective
   -          Can treat any episodes acutely with 0.5
  nitro paste,
   oxygen; morphine, avoid lasix given ARf from likely dry intravascular
   state
 Possible ACS
   -          EKG with lead placement issues but can not rule out
   anteroseptal ST elevations
   -          Started medical management with ASA 81, beta blocker
   -          Sent lipids this AM, elevated but difficult to interpret
   given sever hepatic dysfunction, would be cautious with statin
   -          Not a candidate for an intervention or heparin gtt given
   known GIB and h/o recent melena at home
   -          trend cardiac enzymes, flat thus far, 3^rd set today
   -          serial EKGs
   -          echo on Monday
 HYPOGLYCEMIA / DIABETES
   Patient was on secretogogue at home in setting of impaired hepatic
   clearance as well as possibly compromised hepatic gluconeogenesis
   secondary to metastatic disease.  He has become hypoglycemic during
   admission despite not getting any insulin, however has also become
   hyperglycemic without insulin
   -          regular ISS, monitor glucose Q4H, give D50 prn
   -          f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
 HYPERTENSION -
   -          was as high as 180s last night, again possibly precipitating
   decreased LV compliance and pulmonary edema
   -          flow limiting CAD may be contributing to poor LV compliance
   -          increase metoprolol to 50mg TID as above, would add
   hydralazine next if not effective
 ARF
 Cr bumped to 2.4 today, was 0.6 on admission
   -          most likely cause is prerenal failure given FeUrea of 28%
   yesterday
   -          will formally exclude post-renal failure with a renal
   ultrasound
   -          could also have component of ATN from peri-intubation
   hypotension
   -          review meds for any intrinsic nephrotoxins, I do not see
   any. Send urine Eo
s for AIN.
   -          transfuse 1 unit pRBCs over 4 hours to allow for improved
   intravascular volume and possible amelioration of coronary ischemia as
   well
   -          renally dose all meds, caution with insulin
   -          start sevelamer tid with meals for phos binding
   -          avoid nephrotoxins
 Transaminitis
 worsening, although with baseline severe hepatic
   dysfunction on presentation
   -          could be from poor intravascular volume causing relative
   poor hepatic perfusion, shock liver
   -          could also represent enzyme release from elsewhere in body
   (i.e. myocardium)
   -           trend LFTs
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER)- HCC vs metastatic
   colorectal cancer vs. 2 primaries
   -          Had long discussion with son and pt re: poor prognosis and
   recommendation to maximize quality of remaining time, mentiononed that
   given current comorbidities he can not receive chemotherapy
   -          Pall care consult to help discuss home hospice options, DNR
   status
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY) Stable. Patient most likely
   has appropriately increased ADH in setting of cirrhosis.
   -          fluid restrict to 1500ml free water
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   -          continue levothyroxine, no sense in checking TFTs after new
   diagnosis
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   -          Hct has been stable, monitor HCT daily unless clinically

   # Coagulopathy - improved today
   -          likely secondary to liver metastases and poor synthetic
   function, indicating very advanced disease, but could be a nutritional
   component
   -          continue 3 day course  of vitamin K (last day today [**2-1**])

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of presumed hepatocellular carcinoma and possible second malignancy. He was admitted for mental status change in the setting of hypoglycemia. In the ICU, he has experienced several complications including pulmonary edema, possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), renal failure, hypoglycemia/diabetes, hypertension, transaminitis, cancer (HCC vs metastatic colorectal cancer), hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, gastrointestinal bleed (melena), coagulopathy, and portal vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient had episodes of flash pulmonary edema, which recurred again yesterday. It is unclear about the precipitant (hypertension vs. ACS). The goal is to improve control of systolic blood pressure to less than 140 mmHg. Beta blockers will be increased to 50 mg three times a day, and afterload reduction with hydralazine will be added if increasing beta blockers are not effective. Nitro paste, oxygen, morphine, and avoiding Lasix will be used for treating episodes acutely.

2. Possible ACS: The EKG showed anteroseptal ST elevations, but lead placement issues make it difficult to interpret. Medical management with aspirin 81 mg, beta blockers, and statins (with caution due to severe hepatic dysfunction) will be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged male with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently experiencing worsening renal failure, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and jaundice. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, malignancy (hepatic cancer), gastrointestinal bleed, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 107/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals poor dentition, systolic murmur, asymmetric chest expansion with decreased breath sounds at the left base, fine crackles at the right base, soft non-tender abdomen with distension, jaundiced skin, and muscle wasting.

Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin). The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

Radiology shows evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and atelectasis. The patient has been started on various medications including lopressor, LMNO, heparin sodium, and regular insulin sliding scale.

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo gentleman with presumed hepatocellular carcinoma with possible
   second malignancy admitted for mental status change in setting of
   hypoglycemia, ICU course complicated by episodes of proabable flash
   pulmonary edema.
 Pulmonary Edema
 recurred again yesterday, again in setting of
   hypertension, unclear which is the precipitant
   -          Improve control of SBP to <140, consider re-instituting
   short acting ACE vs. beta blocker
   -          treat any episodes acutely with 0.5
  nitro paste, lasix,
   oxygen; morphine
 Possible ACS
   -          EKG with lead placement issues but can not rule out
   anteroseptal ST elevations
   -          Started medical management with ASA 81, beta blocker
   -          Sent lipids this AM, elevated but difficult to interpret
   given sever hepatic dysfunction, would be cautious with statin
   -          Not a candidate for an intervention or heparin gtt given
   known GIB
   -          trend cardiac enzymes, flat thus far
   -          serial EKGs
   -          echo on Monday
 HYPOGLYCEMIA / DIABETES
   Patient was on secretogogue at home in setting of impaired hepatic
   clearance as well as possibly compromised hepatic gluconeogenesis
   secondary to metastatic disease.  He has become hypoglycemic during
   admission despite not getting any insulin, however has also become
   hyperglycemic without insulin
   -          regular ISS, monitor glucose Q4H, give D50 prn
   -          f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
 HYPERTENSION -
   -          was as high as 180s last night, again possibly precipitating
   decreased LV compliance and pulmonary edema
   -          flow limiting CAD could also be contriibuting to poor
   tolerance of HTN and poor LV compliance
   -          continue  po metoprolol 25mg TID
 ARF
 Cr bumped to 2.4 today, was 0.6 on admission
   -          most liekly cause is prerenal failure given FeUrea of 28%
   yesterday
   -          could also have component of ATN from peri-intubation
   hypotension
   -          would not give fluid challenge right now in setting of
   contiued episodes of flash pulmonary edema
   -          trend Cr
   -          renally dose all meds! Even more caution with insulin
   -          start sevelamer tid with meals for phos binding
   -          avoid nephrotoxins so will avoid ACE-I
s for BP control
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER)
   Most likely has HCC, but atypical histology suggestive of possible
   metastatic colorectal cancer.
   -          appreciate oncology recs
   -          deferring colonoscopy until more stable
   -          ? if family and patient aware that he is not candidate for
   chemotherapy at this time because of poor performance status, will try
   to readdress today
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY) Stable. Patient most likely
   has appropriately increased ADH in setting of cirrhosis.
   -          fluid restrict to 1500ml free water, could diurese if
   hyponatremia worsens
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   -          continue levothyroxine, no sense in checking TFTs after ne
   diagnosis
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of presumed hepatocellular carcinoma and possible second malignancy. He was admitted for mental status changes in the setting of hypoglycemia. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by episodes of probable flash pulmonary edema, recurrent pulmonary edema, possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), worsening renal failure, hypoglycemia/diabetes, hypertension, acute kidney injury (ARF), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has had recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema, which can be life-threatening. This can lead to respiratory distress and potentially respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. ACS: The patient has possible ACS, as indicated by ST elevation in the anteroseptal leads on the EKG. If this is confirmed, it may require immediate intervention such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy.

3. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as evidenced by the rising creatinine levels. This can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the inability to eliminate medications effectively.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently high, which can contribute to the development of complications such as flash pulmonary edema and cardiovascular strain. Proper management of"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 83-year-old gentleman with a h/o microfollicular thyroid adenoma
   and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular/colon cancer who presented to
   the ED with mental status changes and increasing confusion, found to be
   obtunded in the setting of severe hypoglycemia (FSBG 20) and briefly
   intubated for respiratory failure c/b hypotension on levophed. Has had

   revealing for negative for HBsAg, negative HBsAb, positive HBcAb, and
   negative HCV Ab. An ultrasound guided liver biopsy was done and initial
   cytology results were positive for malignanct cells consistent with a
   poorly-differentiated carcinoma. Oncology was consulted and believed
   that considering the multiple liver lesions, suspicious lymph nodes,
   poor liver function, and extremely elevated AFP this was most
   consistent with a hepatoma, and stated that it is
   not likely to be resectable based on the pattern of spread, its
   stage and disease at this stage is not amenable to liver
   transplant.  Patient underwent ultrasound-guided liver biopsy to
   confirm this diagnosis.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of microfollicular thyroid adenoma and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular/colon cancer. He presented to the emergency department with mental status changes and increasing confusion, found to be obtunded in the setting of severe hypoglycemia (FSBG 20) and briefly intubated for respiratory failure due to hypotension on levophed. 

He has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema since coming to the unit, last on [**1-31**]. The cause of this is unclear, with possible precipitants including hypertension or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The goal is to improve control of systolic blood pressure to less than 140, and the beta blocker has been increased to 50mg tid with good effect. If acute episodes occur, treatment with.5"" nitropaste, oxygen, and morphine can be used. Lasix has been avoided due to acute renal failure (ARF) and likely intravascular depletion.

There is also a possible diagnosis of ACS, with anteroseptal ST elevations, but the enzymes have been flat. Medical management with aspirin and a beta blocker has been initiated. An echocardiogram today will be performed. 

The patient has metastatic hepatocellular/colon cancer, with tumor markers showing a very elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), CEA within normal limits, and slightly elevated CA-19-9. Hep"

   Imaging: TTE:  he left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal
   inferior and inferolateral segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
   normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild focal left ventricular dysfunction. Mild mitral
   regurgitation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's chief complaint is an altered mental status. The patient has a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), renal failure, malignant neoplasm of the liver, hypoglycemia, respiratory failure, liver function abnormalities, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type II, and upper gastrointestinal bleed.

From the 24-hour events section, it is mentioned that the patient underwent a transthoracic echo (TTE) and an EKG. The TTE showed ejection fraction (EF) of 45-50% with basal hypokinesis. The patient also experienced a desaturation episode while moving around to get on the bed pan, resulting in an increase in blood pressure to 177/65 mmHg. The patient was given nebulization, which resolved the symptoms.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/43 to 177/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient received a total input of 1,290 mL (including 100 mL IVF) and had a total output of 743 mL (including 195 mL urine). The patient's weight is 81.1 kg,"

   Imaging: TTE:  he left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal
   inferior and inferolateral segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
   normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild focal left ventricular dysfunction. Mild mitral
   regurgitation.

   83 y/o male w/ hx of microfollicular thyroid adenoma and recent
   diagnosis of HCC/colon CA who presented to the ED w/ mental status
   changes and increasing confusion, found to be obtunded in the setting
   of severe hypoglycemia (FSBG 20) and briefly intubated for respiratoyr

   flash pulmonary edema since coming to the unit, las [**1-31**].
   # Hypoxia
 pt w/ hypoxia today in setting of hypertension of SBP of
   160, similar episode last night.  Likely flash pulmonary edema, w/
   pulmonary edema noted on CXR.
   n        goal to improved control of SBP to < 140, BB of 50mg TID, but
   continued episodes.  Could add hydralazine for afterload reduction as
   continues to have flash pulmonary edema.  But as BP only increases w/
   activity, and otherwise running with SBP will defer at this time.
   n        If acute episode, can treat with .5
 nitropase and oxygen.
   Have avoided lasix [**1-10**] to ARF and likely intravascular depletion.  Gave
   0.5mg morphine today, but possibly worsened mental status.  Will avoid
   if possible given liver dysfunction.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of microfollicular thyroid adenoma and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colon cancer. He presented to the emergency department with mental status changes, confusion, and severe hypoglycemia. He was briefly intubated for respiratory failure due to hypotension and is currently on levophed. The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema since being admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient experienced hypoxia today in the setting of hypertension with a blood pressure of 160. This could be due to flash pulmonary edema, which was also noted on the chest X-ray. The goal is to improve control of blood pressure to less than 140 using beta-blockers. If the patient continues to have episodes of flash pulmonary edema, adding hydralazine for afterload reduction may be considered.

2. Metastatic Hepatocellular/Colon Cancer: The patient has metastatic liver disease, and considering the multiple liver lesions, suspicious lymph nodes, and worsening liver function, treatment options may not be beneficial. A family meeting with oncology will be held to explore if treatment is recommended.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia is labile and was initially due to impaired hepatic clearance as well as possible compromise of hepatic gluconeogenesis caused by metastatic disease."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health complications. The chief complaints include hepatic failure, renal failure, and pulmonary edema. The patient's medical history is limited due to a language barrier, but it is known that the patient has a history of malignancy, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient's review of systems reveals fatigue, jaundice, anemia, coagulopathy, and no reported pain.

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/50 mmHg to 177/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and is receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, with normal cardiovascular findings except for an absent first heart sound. Peripheral pulses are present but not assessed. Respiratory examination reveals crackles at the lung bases. Abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender, distended abdomen with a palpable nodular liver. Extremities show bilateral edema. Neurologic examination is limited due to the patient's alert but depressed mental status.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated liver enzymes, abnormal kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows no significant changes in pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of microfollicular thyroid adenoma and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colon cancer. He presented to the emergency department with mental status changes and increasing confusion, found to be obtunded in the setting of severe hypoglycemia (FSG of 20) and briefly intubated for respiratory failure due to hypotension. Since being in the ICU, he has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema. 

The patient's current condition includes hepatic failure, renal failure, and pulmonary edema. His vital signs show a blood pressure of 120/50 mmHg, heart rate of 68 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and liver enzymes such as ALT and AST. His glucose levels are fluctuating, with some readings below normal. 

Imaging reveals no significant change in pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions on chest X-ray. 

The assessment and plan include hypoxia, which is likely flash pulmonary edema, and the goal is to improve blood pressure control to less than 140, possibly adding hydralazine for afterload reduction. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of microfollicular thyroid adenoma and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colon cancer. He presented to the emergency department with mental status changes and increasing confusion, and was found to be obtunded in the setting of severe hypoglycemia (FSG 20) and briefly intubated for respiratory failure due to hypotension. 

The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema since being admitted to the unit. He is experiencing hypoxia today in the setting of hypertension, with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 160. This episode is similar to one that occurred last night, and it is likely flash pulmonary edema, as pulmonary edema has been noted on the chest X-ray (CXR). 

The patient's acute coronary syndrome (ACS) enzymes remain flat, suggesting that the symptoms are not related to ACS but rather to hypertension. The patient is currently being treated with beta-blockers (BB) and aspirin (ASA) to control blood pressure and reduce the risk of further episodes. However, the patient continues to experience flash pulmonary edema, and considering his worsening condition, it may be necessary to add hydralazine for afterload reduction. 

The patient's renal function is worsening, indicated by an increase in creatinine levels. He remains non-oliguric with decent urine output. The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of microfollicular thyroid adenoma and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colon cancer. He presented to the emergency department with mental status changes, confusion, and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and received pressor support due to hypotension. He has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema since being admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition is complicated by severe hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), confusion, portal vein thrombosis, hypothyroidism, and metastatic HCC/colon cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels were extremely low (FSBG 20), leading to a brief period of unconsciousness and subsequent intubation. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have significantly increased from 0.6 to 3.3, indicating kidney dysfunction. The cause of ARF could be pre-renal due to poor intravascular volume or hepatorenal due to liver failure. Further evaluation is required to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

3. Confusion: The patient's mental status changes may be attributed to multiple factors including hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, or narcotics."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is an altered mental status. The patient experienced episodes of shortness of breath (SOB) requiring an increase in oxygen and IV morphine. The patient also reported chest pain, and an EKG was performed. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient is currently receiving infusions of morphine sulfate, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and pantoprazole (Protonix). 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for dry mouth, jaundice, and episodes of SOB. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 68 bpm (59-81 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 104/43 mmHg to 158/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (16-32 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases bilaterally, tender RUQ, trace edema in both extremities, and jaundice. Neurologic examination shows the patient attentive, following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, and having purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated troponin T, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values, such as glucose and electrolytes"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of microfollicular thyroid adenoma and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colon cancer. He presented to the emergency department with mental status changes, severe hypoglycemia, and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and vasopressor support. He has experienced multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure, making him unsuitable for chemotherapy. The patient's goals of care have been changed to comfort/hospice, and he will be transferred to a nursing home for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Hypoglycemia: The patient's severe hypoglycemia could lead to neurologic complications, including altered mental status, confusion, and even seizures if not promptly treated.

2. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema can result in respiratory distress, decreased oxygenation, and potentially respiratory arrest if not managed effectively.

3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's progressive acute respiratory failure may require ongoing respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation, to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

4. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): The presence of HCC could lead to liver dysfunction, portal hypertension, and complications like variceal bleeding or hepatic encephalopathy.

5. Colon Cancer: Metastatic colon cancer can cause systemic effects and complications, such as weight loss,"
