","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic renal failure. The patient presented with hypotension and left foot infection. He was initially volume depleted and subsequently developed multifactorial shock due to septic shock from the left foot cellulitis, adrenal insufficiency, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including diabetic foot ulcer, chronic kidney disease, acute mental status changes, respiratory distress, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, and systolic congestive heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently on peritoneal dialysis. This increases the risk of further renal deterioration and the need for additional renal support.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's presentation is consistent with ACS, specifically NSTEMI. There is a risk of progression to a full-blown myocardial infarction if not managed appropriately.
3. Cellulitis: The left foot infection has progressed to cellulitis. If not treated promptly and effectively, it may lead to worsening infection, systemic involvement, and potential septic shock.
4. Sepsis: The combination of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. He was admitted with septic shock caused by left lower extremity cellulitis. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, acute coronary syndrome, cellulitis, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's history of chronic renal failure puts him at risk for further deterioration of renal function.
2. Acute coronary syndrome: The positive cardiac biomarkers and ischemic changes on EKG indicate an ongoing cardiac event, which may progress to a full-blown myocardial infarction.
3. Cellulitis: The infection in the left lower extremity needs to be managed properly to prevent its spread and potential complications.
4. Sepsis: As the patient is already in septic shock, there is a risk of further deterioration and progression to septic shock with organ dysfunction.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to immobility and risk factors such as diabetes, the patient is at increased risk of developing DVT.
6. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged bed rest and impaired mobility can lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, renal transplant in 2019, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and presenting with left lower extremity cellulitis. The patient is in shock and has been intubated on pressors.

24-hour events:
- The patient's blood sugar has been controlled with an insulin infusion.
- There were increased levels of cardiac markers (CK/MB/Trop T), and an EKG showed ischemic changes, indicating a possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient's blood pressure improved after starting steroids.
- The patient's mental status changed acutely, but a CT scan showed prior infarcts without any new acute findings.

Assessment and plan:
1. Multifactorial shock: The patient initially had hypovolemic shock but also has sepsis (likely due to left lower extremity cellulitis), adrenal insufficiency (on chronic prednisone and failed stress dose steroid), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with a history of two vessel disease in 2011.
   - Continue IV fluid boluses to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) between 10-12.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, renal transplant in 2019, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, who presents with left lower extremity cellulitis, found to be in shock, intubated on pressors. The patient has several medical complications including multifactorial shock, NSTEMI, systolic congestive heart failure, acute mental status changes, acute respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, and diabetes mellitus type 1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifactorial Shock: The patient is experiencing hypovolemic shock due to fluid loss, septic shock from cellulitis, adrenal insufficiency, and NSTEMI. Continuous intravenous fluid boluses are being given to maintain central venous pressure between 10-12, and the patient is intermittently on levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure above 60.

2. NSTEMI: The patient's EKG shows ischemic changes, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or demand ischemia. Serial cardiac enzymes, EKGs will be monitored until they peak. The patient is on aspirin 325 mg, Plavix, statin, and heparin gtt.

3. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, post-renal transplant, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, who presents with left lower extremity cellulitis, found to be in shock, intubated on pressors.

The patient has been receiving various medications including insulin, heparin, midazolam, fentanyl, ASA, ranitidine, calcitriol, cyclosporine, Plavix, simvastatin, hydrocortisone, and fludrocort.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C
- Heart rate: 64 bpm
- Blood pressure: 99/61 mmHg (88/55 mmHg - 161/85 mmHg)

- Arterial blood gas: pH 7.29, PaCO2 33 mmHg, PaO2 156

The patient's imaging results include a chest X-ray showing minimal perihilar fullness, otherwise clear with low lung volumes, and a CT head showing prior infarcts, nothing acute.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
- Multifactorial shock: The patient was initially volume depleted, with an element of septic shock likely due to left lower extremity cellulitis. There is also a history of MRSA/Prevotella species/Presumptive Veillonella in the left foot post-surgical incision and drainage in 12/2132. Additionally, the patient has failed her [Last Name (un)] stim test.
- Continue IVFs for CVP 10-12.
- Currently off levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.
- Cover broadly with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for diabetic foot ulcer.
- Follow up blood cultures and urine cultures.
- Continue hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.
- Serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs until peak.
- ASA 325 mg.
- Heparin gtt.
- ECHO for wedge myocardial infarction.
- Cardiology follow-up, appreciate recommendations.
- Acute mental status changes: The patient had acute mental status changes this morning, found to have blood glucose of 40. Oriented in the emergency department with fingerstick glucose of 308. CT head showed prior infarcts, nothing acute. Wife refused lumbar puncture.
- Respiratory distress: The patient was intubated electively. CXR with pulmonary edema. On minimal ventilatory support.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) with gastroparesis/neuropathy, post renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction (EF) 45%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), presenting with left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, found to be in shock, intubated on pressors.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:
1. Multifactorial shock: Initially hypovolemic, also with sepsis (likely LLE cellulitis), adrenal insufficiency (on chronic pred and failed [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with history of 2 vessel disease in [**2131**].
2. NSTEMI: EKG with ischemic changes, no STEMI.
3. Systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): ECHO from [**1-25**]--EF 45-50%, akinesis of basal inferior wall and hypokinesis of the mid and basal inferolateral wall.
4. Acute mental status changes: Pt had acute MS changes this AM, found to have blood glucose of 40. Oriented in the ED with FS 308. CT head showed prior infarcts, nothing acute.
5. Respiratory distress: Intubated electively. CXR with pulmonary edema. On minimal ventilatory support.
6. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD): On cyclosporine for history of renal transplant. Stress dose steroids.
7. Diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1): Switched to insulin infusion due to stress dose steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's shock, development of further infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), progression of the NSTEMI to a full-blown myocardial infarction, exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and potential complications related to the patient's end-stage renal disease, including fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1 with gastroparesis/neuropathy, renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction 45%, peripheral vascular disease. He presents with left lower extremity cellulitis, found to be in shock, intubated on pressors.

24-hour events include an improvement in blood pressure with the start of steroids, increased cardiac enzymes with associated EKG changes leading to the initiation of heparin infusion, hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy, and the administration of midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin infusions.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 64 bpm, blood pressure 99/61 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 11 mmHg and mixed venous oxygen saturation between 92-93%. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,693 mL and output of 445 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,248 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with set tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory system resistance index of 37.

   ECG: ECHO:
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears
   depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of
   the inferior septum and lateral wall;, and akinesis of the posterior
   wall. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-1-21**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further
   reduced secondary to increased hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior,
   and lateral walls, suggesting restenosis/thrombosis of the circumflex

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1, history of renal transplant, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted with septic shock from left lower extremity cellulitis. He has a history of MRSA infection in his foot, which was surgically debrided in 12/2012. The patient is currently in the ICU due to multifactorial shock, including volume depletion, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency. He has a subacute fracture in his left foot but no signs of osteomyelitis or subcutaneous gas on x-ray. The patient's cardiac catheterization showed worsening coronary artery disease but no acute coronary syndrome. His echocardiogram showed a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% with increased hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, indicating restenosis/thrombosis of the circumflex artery stent. The patient also has hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, acute mental status changes, and systolic heart failure. He is currently on multiple medications and has several ongoing plans, including weaning off the ventilator, managing his diabetes, and treating his infections. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Restenosis/thrombosis of the circumflex artery stent: This condition can lead to further reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and worsening heart failure symptoms."

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), chronic kidney disease (CKD), renal transplant in 2019, coronary artery disease (CAD), and impaired myocardial perfusion with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. The patient was admitted with septic shock from left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis. 

The patient's current medical conditions include multifactorial shock due to hypovolemia, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency; demand ischemia; respiratory failure; end-stage renal disease (ESRD); diabetes mellitus type 1; and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate (HR) of 57 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 123/67 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%, and sinus bradycardia. The patient is sedated and intubated, but has been extubated and is now on humidified face mask with resolved respiratory failure.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating an inflammatory response. The kidney function tests (KFT) show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment. The cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T) are elevated, suggesting myocardial injury. The electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's imaging results include an echocardiogram (ECHO) showing reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 40% due to hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, suggesting restenosis/thrombosis of the circumflex artery stent. The foot x-ray shows a subacute fracture but no specific features for osteomyelitis or subcutaneous gas.

The patient's plan of care includes maintaining adequate fluid balance and mean arterial pressure (MAP), weaning off levophed, continuing antibiotics for diabetic foot ulcer, and managing blood sugars.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction (EF) 45%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and currently presents with left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis. The patient was found in shock and intubated on pressors. The patient has multiple comorbidities including multifactorial shock, sepsis (likely LLE cellulitis), adrenal insufficiency (on chronic prednisone and failed [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with a history of two-vessel disease in [**2131**].

Potential medical complications:
1. Multifactorial shock: The patient initially had hypovolemic shock but also has septic shock (likely due to LLE cellulitis), adrenal insufficiency, and NSTEMI.
2. Sepsis: The patient has an infection in the LLE that may progress to sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is on chronic prednisone and has failed [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim, indicating possible adrenal insufficiency.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, renal transplant in 2119, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, and presenting with left lower extremity cellulitis. The patient was found in shock, intubated on pressors, and diagnosed with multifactorial shock initially hypovolemic, septic (likely due to left lower extremity cellulitis), and adrenal insufficiency (on chronic prednisone and failed [Last Name (un) 45] stim).

The patient also has demand ischemia, as evidenced by EKG changes and no ST-segment elevation, which indicates the need for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the future. The patient's acute mental status changes were observed this morning, with a blood glucose level of 40, but improved after being extubated. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis and is on cyclosporine for a previous renal transplant. Stress dose steroids have been administered.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate 57 bpm, blood pressure 120/67 mmHg, SpO2 100%, and respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute. The patient's review of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, a history of renal transplant in 2019, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, and currently presenting with left lower extremity cellulitis. The patient was found to be in shock, intubated on pressors, and diagnosed with multifactorial shock including hypovolemia, sepsis (likely due to LLE cellulitis), and adrenal insufficiency. The patient also has demand ischemia, as indicated by EKG changes, and requires CABG in the future. Additionally, the patient experienced acute mental status changes, acute respiratory failure requiring intubation, and is on peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal disease. The patient has diabetes mellitus type 1 and is currently managed with an insulin infusion due to stress dose steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's left lower extremity cellulitis may progress to a severe bacterial infection, leading to sepsis.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. The demand ischemia indicated by EKG changes increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure could recur if there are issues with weaning from the ventilator or"

   52M with DM1 with gastroparesis/neuropathy, s/p renal transplant in
   [**2119**], CAD, CHF with EF 45%, PVD who presents with LLE cellulitis, found
   to be in shock, intubated on pressors.
   # Multifactorial shock:  Initially hypovolumeic. Also with sepsis
   (likely LLE cellulitis) and adrenal insufficiency (on chronic pred and
   failed [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim).
   - CVP 10-12 at goal
   - Currently intermittently on levophed to maintain MAP >60
   - Remains on hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6h- will taper likely tomorrow if
   able to wean off pressors
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/cipro for diabetic foot ulcer
   - S/p Podiatry c/s , will also involve vascular surgery team
   - F/u cultures
   - Cont. hydrocort and fludrocort for adrenal insufficiency
   # Demand ischemia:  EKG with ischemic changes, no STE
 cards feels it
   is consistent with demand ischemia.  S/p cath [**12-14**]
 needs CABG in
   future
   - Serial cardiac enzymes, EKGs until peak
   - ASA 325 mg / Plavix/ Statin
 off heparin gtt
   - Hold BB for now given intermittent pressor requirement
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s regarding timing of CABG
   # Acute mental status changes:  Pt had acute MS changes this AM, found
   to have blood glucose of 40.  Oriented in the ED with FS 308.  CT head
   showed prior infarcts, nothing acute.  Wife refused LP.
   - Off sedation and extubated
 improved mental status.  Will continue
   to readdress.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and now presenting with left lower extremity cellulitis. He was initially found in hypovolemic shock, which was later complicated by sepsis (likely due to the left lower extremity cellulitis) and adrenal insufficiency (on chronic prednisone and failed [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim). 

The patient's current treatment plan includes maintaining a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10-12 at goal, intermittently using levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, continuing hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6h (which may be tapered off pressors tomorrow if able to wean), covering broadly with vancomycin (Vanc), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin for diabetic foot ulcer, performing a podiatry consult, and involving the vascular surgery team. Cultures will be followed up, and hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone will be continued for adrenal insufficiency.

Additionally, the patient is diagnosed with demand ischemia, as indicated by EKG changes,"

   enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with more prominent opacification
   in the retrocardiac region at the base, consistent with atelectasis and
   effusion. In view of the clinical history, the possibility of a
   superimposed pneumonia must be considered. There is also some
   increasing opacification at the right base

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease, and impaired cardiac function (ejection fraction of 40%) admitted to the ICU.
- The patient presented with septic shock from left lower extremity cellulitis and subendocardial ischemia (type II myocardial infarction).
- The patient was initially on mechanical ventilation but was successfully extubated on [**12-15**].
- On [**12-16**], the patient experienced an acute decompensation with marked hypoxemia, possibly due to aspiration or volume overload.
- The patient's condition has been unstable since then, with ongoing hypoxemic respiratory failure and multifactorial shock that has since resolved.
- The source of the shock is suspected to be LLE cellulitis and adrenal insufficiency.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes peaked on [**12-14**], indicating subendocardial ischemia, and a catheterization showed progression of diffuse multivessel coronary artery disease but no acute coronary syndrome.
- An echocardiogram revealed increased hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls.
- Other comorbidities include end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, and congestive heart failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, cardiac artery disease, and renal transplant admitted to the ICU with septic shock from left lower extremity cellulitis and subendocardial ischemia (type II MI). The patient experienced an acute decompensation with marked hypoxemia, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient was extubated on [12-15] but required reintubation due to the hypoxemia. The patient's shock has resolved, and they are now off pressors. There is suspicion of a source of infection in the left lower extremity cellulitis and possible adrenal insufficiency. The patient's condition requires ongoing management, including oxygen therapy, diuretics, antibiotics, and further diagnostic evaluations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status deteriorated after extubation, resulting in marked hypoxemia. This could be due to aspiration or volume overload, and further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Multifactorial Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which has since resolved. However, the possibility of another source of shock, such as adrenal insufficiency, should be considered.
3. Left Lower Extremity Cellulitis: The patient has an active infection in the left lower extremity, which may require aggressive treatment and potentially debridement.
4. Subendocard"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, chronic kidney disease, and a renal transplant in [**2119**]. The patient is currently admitted with septic shock from left lower extremity cellulitis and subendocardial ischemia (type II MI).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, multifactorial shock (resolved), subendocardial ischemia, end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systolic congestive heart failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in maintaining oxygen levels above 92%, indicating a potential respiratory problem. This could be due to aspiration or volume overload, as suggested by the presence of atelectasis and effusion on imaging studies.

2. Left lower extremity cellulitis: The patient has an active infection in the left lower extremity, which may require further evaluation and treatment to prevent worsening of the condition.

3. Subendocardial ischemia: The patient has evidence of subendocardial ischemia, which could be related to his underlying coronary artery disease. This condition should be monitored closely to prevent further complications.

4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD and is currently on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management of fluid balance are essential to prevent"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is shock and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), cardiac artery disease (CAD), and renal transplant. The patient was admitted with septic shock from left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis and subendocardial ischemia (type II MI).

The patient's recent events include being extubated, discontinuing levophed, and having a nasogastric (NG) tube placed due to the inability to safely swallow pills. The patient's medications include insulin, regular, heparin sodium, and various other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 137/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 70% face tent. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 25 mmHg, SaO2 of 43%, and lactate level of 3.0.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, diminished breath sounds at the bases, trace edema in both lower extremities, cool skin, and a contained cellulitic rash on the left lower extremity.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, hem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, cardiac arrest due to myocardial infarction, and renal transplant. He presented to the ICU with septic shock from left lower extremity cellulitis and subendocardial ischemia. The patient's respiratory status was stable after extubation until he experienced an acute decompensation with marked hypoxemia in the early morning, with an unclear precipitant. Aspiration event is possible as the patient self-discontinued the NG tube, but no infiltrate is seen on the chest X-ray. There is evidence of volume overload despite not being readily apparent on the chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status had been stable since extubation until an acute decompensation with marked hypoxemia. Oxygen therapy is being given to maintain saturation above 92%. A trial of diuresis is being attempted to address possible volume overload. Antibiotics for nosocomial pneumonia coverage are being continued.
2. Multifactorial Shock: The patient's shock has resolved, and he is now off pressors for over 24 hours. The suspected source of the shock is left lower extremity cellulitis and adrenal insufficiency based on inadequate cortisol stimulation response. Vancomycin dosage is being adjusted based on levels, and zosyn is being continued for coverage of diabetic foot ulcer and nosocom"

   enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with more prominent opacification
   in the retrocardiac region at the base, consistent with atelectasis and
   effusion. In view of the clinical history, the possibility of a
   superimposed pneumonia must be considered. There is also some
   increasing opacification at the right base
   medially, that could represent a developing consolidation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and renal transplant. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to left lower extremity cellulitis and subendocardial ischemia (type II myocardial infarction). The patient experienced an acute decompensation of respiratory status with marked hypoxemia after extubation, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure. He also had multifactorial shock that resolved and was off pressors for 24 hours. The source of the shock is suspected to be LLE cellulitis and adrenal insufficiency based on inadequate cortisol stimulation response. The patient's current conditions include systolic congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status deteriorated after extubation, resulting in marked hypoxemia. This could be due to aspiration, volume overload, or a nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Multifactorial Shock: The patient experienced shock that has since resolved. The suspected sources include LLE cellulitis and adrenal insufficiency.
3. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 40% and may require diuretics and beta-blockers for management.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient has ESR"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, and lower extremity cellulitis. He presented with hypoxemia, shock (initially hypovolemic), sepsis (likely due to LLE cellulitis), and adrenal insufficiency. The patient required intubation and was on pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60. He also had demand ischemia, acute mental status changes, acute respiratory failure, and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient has been experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood. The plan includes administering Lasix, performing LE Dopplers, and considering a pulmonary embolism (PE) CT.
2. Multifactorial shock: The patient initially had hypovolemic shock, but now also has septic shock likely due to LLE cellulitis and adrenal insufficiency. The treatment plan includes maintaining central venous pressure (CVP) at 10-12, weaning off pressors if possible, continuing hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6h, and covering broadly with vanc/zosyn/cipro for diabetic foot ulcer.
3. Demand ischemia: The patient's EKG showed ischemic changes, and it is believed that this is due to demand ischemia. Serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs will be performed, and the patient will be started on ASA 325 mg, Plavix, and a statin. Heparin gtt will be discontinued.
4. Acute mental status changes: The patient had acute mental status changes this morning, which were associated with a blood glucose of 40. He was oriented in the ED with a fingerstick glucose of 308. A CT head showed prior infarcts, but nothing acute. The patient's mental status improved after being extubated and removed from sedation.
5. Acute respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated for acute respiratory failure but was successfully extubated this morning.
6. ESRD on PD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on peritoneal dialysis. He is also on cyclosporine for his renal transplant and stress dose steroids.
7. DM1: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 1 is being managed with an insulin infusion due to stress dose steroids. The plan is to resume his home regimen when eating.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, renal transplant, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, and currently presenting with lower extremity cellulitis. The patient was found to be in shock and intubated on pressors. He was extubated on the 15th but experienced hypoxemia, which is still ongoing. The patient's recent events include being weaned off Levophed, cardiac surgery consult indicating no immediate CABG, placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT), and delirium and agitation overnight potentially due to hypoxemia. The patient's allergies include Reglan and protonix. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on the 14th and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on the 15th. The patient's current medications include ASA 325 daily, calcitriol, cyclosporine 25mg daily, Plavix 75 daily, Renagel, simvastatin, hydrocortisone 50 IV q6h, fludrocortisone, ciprofloxacin, Zosyn, and heparin subcutaneously.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, renal transplant, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, and currently presenting with left lower extremity cellulitis. The patient was found in shock and intubated on pressors. He has been extubated but remains hypoxemic, with an unclear etiology of acute decompensation. The patient's condition includes multifactorial shock (initially hypovolemic, septic likely due to left lower extremity cellulitis, and adrenal insufficiency), demand ischemia, agitation/delirium, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, and diabetes mellitus type 1. The patient's medical history includes previous renal transplant, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing difficulty maintaining adequate oxygen levels in the blood. This could be due to pulmonary edema, aspiration during NGT self-removal, or pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation and management are needed, including repeating ABG and considering a PE CT scan if persistently hypoxemic.
2. Multifactorial shock: The patient initially presented with hypovolemic shock but has since developed septic shock likely due to left lower extremity cellulitis and adrenal ins"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease, and impaired cardiac function (EF 40%) admitted with septic shock from left lower extremity cellulitis and subendocardial ischemia (type II MI).

2. The patient had been stable after extubation on [**12-15**] but experienced an acute decompensation with marked hypoxemia early in the morning. The cause of this hypoxemic respiratory failure is unclear, with possible aspiration event due to self-discontinuation of the nasogastric tube. The patient also had volume overload, despite not being readily apparent on the chest X-ray.

3. The patient's condition improved with oxygen therapy to maintain saturation above 92%, trial of diuresis (although Lasix did not produce any output), and continuation of antibiotics for nosocomial pneumonia covering common pathogens. The antibiotic coverage was switched to nafcillin, considering the growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) from the foot swab.

4. The patient's multifactorial shock resolved and he was taken off pressors approximately 24 hours ago. The suspected sources of the shock were left lower extremity cellulitis and adrenal insufficiency based on inadequate cortisol stimulation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and a history of renal transplant. He was admitted with septic shock due to lower left extremity cellulitis and subendocardial ischemia (type II MI). The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, multifactorial shock, subendocardial ischemia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 1, and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has been stable after extubation, but there was an acute decompensation with marked hypoxemia. The cause is unclear, but possible precipitants include aspiration or volume overload. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation above 92% and a trial of diuresis is being considered.
2. Multifactorial Shock: The patient experienced shock that resolved and was likely due to lower left extremity cellulitis and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is off pressors and the source of shock is being treated.
3. Subendocardial Ischemia: The patient's enzymes peaked on [**12-14**] indicating subendocardial ischemia. Further evaluation with cardiac catheterization showed progression of diffuse multivessel coronary artery disease, but no acute coronary syndrome. The patient is on aspirin, clopidogrel"

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with DM1 with gastroparesis/neuropathy, s/p renal transplant in
   [**2119**], CAD, CHF with EF 45%, PVD who presents with LLE cellulitis, found
   to be in shock, intubated on pressors.
   #Hypoxemia:  Extubated [**12-15**]. Unclear etiology of acute decompensation
   last pm.  CXR looks improved.  Considering pulmonary edema vs
   aspiration during NGT self removal vs PE.
   -Re-evaluation oxygen requirements once pt no longer agitated and
   pulling his mask off
   - Lasix to diurese
   - LE Dopplers (did not tolerate this am given agitation)
   - Already broadly covered with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro
   - Repeat ABG
   - with pt now on SQ heparin and until recently, heparin gtt, PE seems
   less likely but if remains persistently hypoxic would obtain CTA
   # Multifactorial shock:  Initially hypovolumeic. Also with sepsis
   (likely LLE cellulitis) and adrenal insufficiency (on chronic pred and
   failed [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim).  Now off levophed.
   - Remains on hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6h- will taper likely tomorrow
   - D/c fludrocortisone
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn for diabetic foot ulcer x 10 days
 d/c
   cipro today
   - F/u cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, gastroparesis/neuropathy, previous renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, and left lower extremity cellulitis. He presented with shock and was intubated on pressors. He is currently extubated and has hypoxemia of unclear etiology. The patient also has multifactorial shock, likely secondary to hypovolemia, sepsis (cellulitis), and adrenal insufficiency. He is being treated with hydrocortisone and broad-spectrum antibiotics. There are concerns about demand ischemia based on EKG changes, and the patient needs CABG in the future. He is experiencing agitation and delirium, which responded to zyprexa overnight. The patient is on peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal disease and is being weaned off stress dose steroids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema vs Aspiration during NGT self-removal vs Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's acute decompensation could be due to pulmonary edema, aspiration during NGT self-removal, or PE. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient is hypoxic despite being extubated. Oxygen requirements need to be re"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, previous renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, and left lower extremity cellulitis. The patient presented with shock, was intubated, and is now extubated and off pressors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are below normal range. This could be due to pulmonary edema, which has been ruled out by the PECT scan. Lasix has been given to diurese and further investigation is needed.
2. Multifactorial shock: The patient initially had hypovolemic shock but also had sepsis (likely due to left lower extremity cellulitis) and adrenal insufficiency. Now the patient is off levophed.
3. Left lower extremity ulcer: The patient has a history of LE ulcer and further follow-up with vascular/podiatry recommendations and arterial doppler studies is needed.
4. Agitation/delirium: The patient is experiencing fluctuating mental status and agitation, which responded to zyprexa. Consideration should be given to haloperidol as well.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, gastroparesis/neuropathy, a history of renal transplant in 2019, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, and left lower extremity cellulitis. The patient presented with shock and was intubated on pressors. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated worsening three-vessel disease with no lesion amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention, suggesting subendocardial ischemia. The patient has been extubated and is now off pressors. 

The patient's ongoing problems include hypoxemia, multifactorial shock, left leg ulcer, agitation/delirium, demand ischemia, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, and feeding intolerance. The patient's mental status is not able to tolerate a nasogastric tube, so the wife refuses its insertion. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, and troponin T levels. Imaging revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and basilar infiltrates, but no pulmonary embolism. Microbiology results indicate methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in the wound. 

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing lasix to diurese, following up with a final CT scan, reducing steroids to home dose, starting antibiotic taper based on cultures, broadening coverage at first sign"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, renal transplant in 2019, coronary artery disease, and impaired cardiac function. He was admitted with septic shock due to left lower extremity cellulitis, adrenal insufficiency, and subendocardial ischemia (type II MI). The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure has resolved, and he is now receiving supplemental oxygen. His multifactorial shock has also resolved, and he is hemodynamically stable. The foot wound swab is growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), but the culture may not reflect coinfection with gram negatives/anaerobes. The patient is continuing on nafcillin, and there is a low threshold to go back to broader coverage if clinically worsens. He is also continuing on his home dose of prednisone.

The patient's subendocardial ischemia peaked on [12-14], and a catheterization showed progression of diffuse multivessel coronary artery disease but no acute coronary syndrome. An echocardiogram showed increased hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls. The patient is being prescribed aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, and a beta-blocker.

The patient has end-stage renal disease and is currently on peritoneal dialysis. His cyclosporine dose should be clarified with the renal team. He"

            Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during prolonged
            therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
   initially
            susceptible may become resistant within three to four days
   after
            initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may be
            warranted.
            Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**8-/2431**])
   immediately if
            sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's
   isolate.

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1, complicated by gastroparesis/neuropathy, who underwent a renal transplant in [**2119**], and also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and impaired myocardial perfusion (EF 40%).
- The patient was admitted with septic shock due to left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, adrenal insufficiency, and subendocardial ischemia (type II MI).
- The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure has resolved, and they are stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula.
- The patient's multifactorial shock has also resolved, and they have been hemodynamically stable for over 48 hours.
- A foot wound swab is growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), but it is not clear if there is a coinfection with gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes.
- The patient is continuing with nafcillin, and there is a low threshold to switch to broader coverage (unasyn) if the patient worsens.
- The patient's home dose of prednisone should be continued.
- The patient requires vascular and podiatry recommendations, as well as follow-up arterial studies.
- The patient had subendocardial ischemia, with enzymes peaking on [**12-14**], and a catheterization showed progression"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, renal transplant in [**2119**], coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who presented with left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis and shock. The patient was intubated on pressors and underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated worsening three vessel disease with no lesion amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), suggesting subendocardial ischemia. The patient has since improved, been extubated, and taken off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: Resolved.
2. Multifactorial shock: Initially hypovolemic, also with sepsis (likely LLE cellulitis) and adrenal insufficiency (on chronic prednisone and failed [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim). Now off levophed.
3. LE ulcer: Physical exam significantly improved.
4. Agitation/delirium: Improving.
5. Demand ischemia: EKG with ischemic changes, no ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient needs coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the future.
6. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD): On cyclosporine for h/o renal transplant. Home dose steroids.

   52M with DM1 with gastroparesis/neuropathy, s/p renal transplant in
   [**2119**], CAD, CHF with EF 45%, PVD who presents with LLE cellulitis and
   shock, ACS, intubated on pressors.  Cardiac cath demonstrated worsening
   3 vs disease with no lesion amenable to PCI, suggesting subendocardial
   ischemia.  Now improved
 extubated and off pressors.  Ongoing problems
   include:
   # Hypoxemia:  Extubated [**12-15**]. PECT yesterday as above.  In the
   interim, oxygen requirement spontaneously improved. Transient hypoxia
   may have represented aspiration, vs pulmonary edema. Unlikely to have
   VAP.
   - Lasix to diurese
   - F/U final CT read
   # Multifactorial shock:  Initially hypovolumeic. Also with sepsis
   (likely LLE cellulitis) and adrenal insufficiency (on chronic pred and
   failed [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim).  Now off levophed.
   - Reduce steroids to home dose (may help with delirium).
   - Start tapering antibiotics based on cultures: Nafcillin
 d/c
   vanc/zosyn. Will broaden coverage at first sign of decompensation.
   #LE ulcer: physical exam significantly improved
   - F/U vascular/podiatry recs
   - F/U arterial dopplers
   # Agitation/delerium:  Fluctuating mental status, redirectable
   -  Responded to zyprexa
   -  Consider haldol prn
   -  D/c stress dose steroids.
   # Demand ischemia:  EKG with ischemic changes, no STE
 cards feels it
   is consistent with demand ischemia.  S/p cath [**12-14**]
 needs CABG in
   future.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis/neuropathy, a history of renal transplant in 2019, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, and left lower extremity cellulitis and shock. The patient presented with acute coronary syndrome, was intubated on pressors, and underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed worsening three-vessel disease with no lesions amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), suggesting subendocardial ischemia. The patient has since improved, extubated, and off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient had transient hypoxia, which may have represented aspiration or pulmonary edema. Unlikely to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Plan includes diuresis with Lasix, follow-up final CT scan, and reducing steroids to home dose to help with delirium.
2. Multifactorial shock: Initially hypovolemic, the patient also had sepsis (likely due to left lower extremity cellulitis) and adrenal insufficiency (on chronic prednisone and failed [Last Name (un) 45] stim). Now off levophed.
Plan includes reducing steroids to home dose, starting tapering antibiotics based on cultures (Nafcillin d/c vanc/zosyn), and broadening coverage at the"
