","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use and hepatitis C virus (HCV), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy. He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) for an aborted liver transplant due to elevated pulmonary pressures. He is now transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's current conditions include volume overload, acute renal failure, alcoholic cirrhosis, and pulmonary hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has signs of elevated left-sided pressure on the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter, indicating a possible volume overload. Lasix (furosemide) is being administered as a diuretic to manage this condition.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is thought to be secondary to volume overload and possibly hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Diuretics have been increased and then held due to worsening renal function. Close monitoring of urine electrolytes is necessary.

3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which is characterized by liver damage caused by long-term excessive alcohol consumption. Complications associated with cirrhosis include ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), hepatic encephalopathy ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis of the liver. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 108/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving CPAP support at home and has a central venous catheter in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (2.7 mg/dL) and potassium (5.0 mEq/L), indicating renal dysfunction. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range. The liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting ongoing liver damage.

The patient is receiving lasix through a peripheral line and morphine for pain management. The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating ongoing fluid loss.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pulmonary hypertension, further deterioration of renal function, and development of infections due to the central venous catheter."

   with ascites and hx of hepatic encephalopathy, with liver transplant
   denied due to elevated pulmonary pressures. Minimal response to lasix
   on the floor. RHC placed in the cath lab with findings suggestive fluid
   overload-  high PWCP, PVR mildly increased. Under these circumstances,
   acute vasodilator therapy presents the risk for presenting an increased
   volume load to the LV with pulmonary edema.
   Placed on lasix gtt yesterday, will increase infusion rate.  Will
   continue to monitor Swan and re-consider flolan depending on PA numbers
   once adequately diuresed. Ascitic fluid is leaking on his

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. However, based on the information provided, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications.

The patient has pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), acute renal failure (ARF), and alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. The plan for managing these conditions includes diuresis to reduce fluid overload, fluid restriction, and consideration of a liver transplant. The patient is also being monitored for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/67 to 121/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 26 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is 67/40 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is 28 mmHg. The patient's cardiac output (CO) is 8.3 L/min, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is 1,154 dynes*sec/cm5, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is 231 dynes*sec/cm5.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and being treated in the ICU. The patient has several medical conditions, including pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, and alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary hypertension: The elevated PCWP indicates a need for diuresis and fluid restriction. If not managed properly, the patient may develop worsening pulmonary hypertension leading to respiratory distress and further complications.

2. Acute renal failure: The unclear etiology of ARF needs further investigation. If left untreated or unmanaged, the patient's renal function may deteriorate, leading to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and potential need for dialysis.

3. Alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver: The patient's history of alcohol use and HCV infection increases the risk of complications related to liver dysfunction. These complications may include hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, portal hypertension, and an increased risk of infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

4. Anemia: The patient has a normocytic anemia. If not addressed appropriately, it can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.

5. OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea): The patient is on CPAP at night. If the CPAP is not effective or not used correctly, the patient may experience recurrent episodes of hypoxia and respiratory distress.

6. FEN (likely referring to enteral nutrition): The patient is tolerating pos (possibly referring to tube feedings). If there are any issues with enteral nutrition, such as aspiration or malabsorption, it can lead to inadequate nutritional support, weight loss, and compromised healing.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical conditions requiring close monitoring and management. Prompt identification and treatment of potential complications are essential to improve the patient's outcomes."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and HCV, pulmonary hypertension, severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy. He was admitted to the SICU for an aborted liver transplant but was transferred to the medicine service for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure, and pulmonary hypertension. He is currently in the MICU for diuresis while on a Swan-Ganz catheter, with possible consideration of Flolan therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right heart strain and failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Cirrhosis/Liver Failure: The patient has cirrhosis with associated liver failure, which can lead to complications such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia that may be due to marrow suppression or chronic blood loss from gastrointestinal issues. Transfusion of packed red blood cells may be required to maintain adequate oxygen carrying capacity.
6. Diverticulosis: The patient has a history of diverticulosis, which may require further evaluation and management during this admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a middle-aged male with a history of alcohol abuse and chronic liver disease, presenting with acute renal failure and pulmonary hypertension. He is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and chronic liver disease, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy due to the buildup of toxins in the brain.
2. Infection: As the patient has multiple lines and tubes inserted, there is an increased risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's pre-existing renal failure could worsen due to factors such as inadequate fluid management, medication toxicity, or complications related to his underlying liver disease.
5. Hypotension and cardiovascular instability: The patient's low blood pressure readings indicate potential cardiovascular instability, which may be attributed to his pulmonary hypertension and compromised cardiac function.
6. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening respiratory distress, especially considering his pulmonary hypertension and potential fluid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension, severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy. He was admitted to the SICU after an aborted liver transplant due to elevated pulmonary pressures. The patient is now in the MICU for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure, and pulmonary hypertension. He has a Swan-Ganz catheter in place and is being considered for Flolan therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume overload: The patient's elevated left-sided pressure on PA catheter suggests volume overload. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500-1000 mL today.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has worsening renal function and is being treated with diuretics. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is necessary.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient requires continued lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy management.
4. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has had therapeutic paracentesis and is on ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.
5. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): The patient's PA mean pressure of 52 with wedge pressure of 28 indicates significant PAH. Further evaluation with repeat right heart catheterization and consideration of Flolan therapy is needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and HCV, pulmonary hypertension, severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy. He was admitted to the SICU after an aborted liver transplant due to elevated pulmonary pressures. He is currently being treated for acute renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and liver failure. The patient has been on diuretics, lactulose, rifaximin, ursodiol, low-dose morphine, and ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis. His condition has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal function, and elevated pulmonary arterial pressures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of recurrent encephalopathy indicates a risk for hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Given the patient's severe ascites, there is a risk for SBP. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, and altered mental status.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's history of cirrhosis and volume overload increases the risk of AKI. Symptoms may include decreased urine output, elevated creatinine levels, and fluid retention.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's elevated pulmonary arterial pressures suggest pulmonary hypertension. This condition can lead to right heart strain and failure.
5. Portal hypertension:"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's current health status can be summarized as follows:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the SICU after an aborted liver transplant due to elevated pulmonary pressures. He is now in the MICU for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure, and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require management:

1. Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN): The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension with a mean PA pressure of 52 and wedge pressure of 28. Diuretic therapy is being continued to lower pulmonary pressures. The possibility of starting Flolan therapy is being considered once diuresis is achieved.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is thought to have ARF secondary to volume overload and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Diuretic therapy has been increased and then held due to worsening renal function. Creatinine levels are being closely monitored.

3. Cirrhosis/Liver Failure: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis with a MELD score of 34-36. He has had therapeutic paracentesis twice to relieve ascites. Medications such as lactulose, rifaximin, ursodiol, and low-dose morphine are being used to manage hepatic encephalopathy, pruritus, and abdominal pain.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with end-stage liver disease, presenting with a history of alcohol abuse. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various complications related to his condition. The patient has undergone multiple interventions, including paracentesis, administration of albumin, and adjustments to diuretic therapy. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate within normal range and blood pressure slightly low. Oxygen saturation is 90% on nasal cannula. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. He is also receiving morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient's review of systems reveals gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea. He also exhibits signs of genitourinary issues with a Foley catheter in place. Anemia and coagulopathy are noted in the heme/lymphatic system review. Delirium is present in the psychiatric/sleep review.

Flowsheet data shows ongoing fluid balance issues, with a total fluid input of 1,371 mL and total fluid output of 9,990 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -8,619 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has received blood products as well. Respiratory support parameters are being monitored, with an ABG showing a pH of 7.33. Physical examination findings include jaundice, muscle wasting, and peripheral edema.

Lab results indicate abnormalities in liver function tests, including elevated liver enzymes, decreased albumin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and HCV. They were admitted to the SICU post-aborted liver transplant due to elevation in pulmonary pressures and are now transferred to the MICU for diuresis while on a Swan-Ganz catheter, with possible consideration of Flolan therapy.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN): The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, as evidenced by increased pulmonary artery pressures. This condition can lead to right heart failure and further complications.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely secondary to volume overload and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Diuretics have been increased and then held due to worsening renal function.

3. Cirrhosis/Liver Failure: The patient has end-stage liver disease with a MELD score of 34-36, which indicates a high risk of mortality. They also have ascites, encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Paracentesis has been performed intermittently to relieve the ascites.

4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which requires ongoing outpatient Synthroid therapy.

5. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, likely due to marrow suppression. Blood transfusions have been given to address the anemia.

   severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy, admitted to SICU post
   aborted liver trx due to elevation in pulmonary pressures. He is now
   transferred to medicine for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure
   and pulmonary hypertension, and transferred to MICU for diuresis while
   Swan in place, with possible consideration of Flolan therapy.
   # Volume Status: elevated left sided pressure on PA catheter, so
   suspect volume overload.  Currently on Lasix gtt. Essentially even this
   AM.
   - Goal -[**Telephone/Fax (1) 179**] ml today

   continuing to hold through [**3-11**].  Intermittent paracentecis for
   relief.
   - continue lactulose and Rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   - continue ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis
   - ursodiol for elevated bilirubin/pruritis
   - low-dose morphine prn for abdominal pain  (MAX 0.5mg)
   - off transplant list until pulmonary arterial hypertension is treated;
   need PA mean of 35 for transplant
   - New nausea/vomiting [**3-14**], may be [**1-22**] dyspepsia following breakfast,
   compazine x 1; consider tap
   #  Acute renal failure: thought to be secondary to volume overload +/-
   HRS at time of transfer from SICU.   Diuretic increased [**3-6**] and then
   held [**Date range (1) 6470**] d/t worsening renal function.  Cr improving on laxix

   - diuresis as above
   - Follow-up urine lytes

   abdominal paint / nausea does not improve)
   - on midodrine for renal perfusion; holding octreotide d/t concern this
   might elevate pulmonary arterial pressures
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  plan at time of transfer from SICU was
   diuresis with goal to lower pulmonary pressures; it was felt at time
   that volume overload was contributing to elevated PA pressures (which
   were increased from cardiac cath in [**Month (only) 25**]).  In MICU for continued
   diuresis (watching the creatinine) in preparation for possible Flolan
   once diuresed, new swan in place in R IJ
   - repeat right heart cath on [**3-11**] (after diuresis) showed mean PA
   pressure of 52 with wedge pressure of 28
   - increase Lasix gtt with goal negative -1000mL+ today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use and hepatitis C virus infection. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications related to his liver disease.

The patient's current medical conditions include pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, and cirrhosis of the liver. His recent interventions include therapeutic paracentesis to remove ascites fluid, diuretics for fluid management, lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis, and ursodiol for elevated bilirubin and pruritus.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR), low hemoglobin (anemia), low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), and impaired kidney function (creatinine). His electrolyte levels are also imbalanced.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of liver function leading to hepatic encephalopathy and worsening of renal failure. The patient's pulmonary hypertension may require additional management such as Flolan therapy. There is also a risk of infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of SBP.

Given the patient's complex medical history and ongoing management, close monitoring and multidisciplinary care are essential to address his multiple organ dysfunction"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a chief complaint of elevated pulmonary pressure. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with symptoms such as fatigue, dry mouth, edema, abdominal pain, and jaundice. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/57 to 118/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on CPAP. 

The patient is receiving intravenous fluids and has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, and alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. Laboratory results show elevated levels of bilirubin, liver enzymes, and creatinine, along with low albumin levels. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening pulmonary hypertension, further deterioration of renal function, and development of hepatic encephalopathy due to the underlying cirrhosis. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, pulmonary function, renal function, and liver function to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   - continue ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis
   - ursodiol for elevated bilirubin/pruritis
   - low-dose morphine prn for abdominal pain  (MAX 0.5mg)
   - off transplant list until pulmonary arterial hypertension is treated;
   need PA mean of 35 for transplant
   #  Acute renal failure: thought to be secondary to volume overload +/-
   HRS at time of transfer from SICU.   Diuretic increased [**3-6**] and then
   held [**Date range (1) 6470**] d/t worsening renal function.  Cr improving on laxix
   gtt, may be due to ventricular interdependence.
   - diuresis as above
   - Follow-up urine lytes

   # Pulmonary hypertension:  plan at time of transfer from SICU was
   diuresis with goal to lower pulmonary pressures; it was felt at time
   that volume overload was contributing to elevated PA pressures (which
   were increased from cardiac cath in [**Month (only) 25**]).  In MICU for continued
   diuresis (watching the creatinine) in preparation for possible Flolan
   once diuresed, new swan in place in R IJ
   - repeat right heart cath on [**3-11**] (after diuresis) showed mean PA
   pressure of 52 with wedge pressure of 28

   Code status:  FULL
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use and hepatitis C, pulmonary hypertension, severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy. The patient was admitted to the SICU post aborted liver transplant due to elevation in pulmonary pressures. He is now transferred to the medicine service for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure, and pulmonary hypertension, and subsequently transferred to the MICU for diuresis while a Swan-Ganz catheter is in place, with possible consideration of Flolan therapy.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN): The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension with a mean PA pressure of 37, which is above the threshold for transplant eligibility (mean PA pressure of 35). The plan is to continue diuresis to lower pulmonary pressures and consider Flolan therapy once diuresed.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to volume overload and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Diuretics have been increased and then held due to worsening renal function. Close monitoring of renal function and daily urine electrolytes is necessary.

3. Cirrhosis/Liver Failure: The patient has advanced cirrhosis with a MELD score of 34-36. This places him at high risk for complications such as ascites, encephalopathy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C, pulmonary hypertension, severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy. He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) post aborted liver transplant due to elevated pulmonary pressures. He is now transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure, and pulmonary hypertension.

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, which is a potential complication of liver disease. His mean pulmonary artery pressure is elevated at 37 mmHg, and he is being considered for Flolan therapy.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely secondary to volume overload and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). His serum creatinine levels are elevated, and he has been placed on diuretics.
3. Cirrhosis/Liver Failure: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and liver failure, as evidenced by his high MELD score (34-36) and presence of ascites, encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He requires ongoing management for these complications, including lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, ursodiol for elevated bilirubin and pruritus, and prophylactic cipro"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the SICU for an aborted liver transplant due to elevated pulmonary pressures. The patient has been transferred to the MICU for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure, and pulmonary hypertension. He is currently on furosemide (Lasix) infusion, morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension and his mean PA pressure is elevated at 52 mmHg with a wedge pressure of 28. This could lead to further complications such as right heart strain or failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute renal failure, which may be secondary to volume overload and hepatorenal syndrome. Close monitoring of renal function and diuretic therapy is necessary.
3. Cirrhosis/Liver Failure: The patient has cirrhosis with a MELD score of 34-36. He is at risk for complications such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
4. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, likely due to marrow suppression. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed is important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of pulmonary hypertension and acute renal failure. He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: This condition can lead to right ventricular failure, arrhythmias, and even death if not managed properly.
2. Acute Renal Failure: This can progress to chronic renal failure if not treated promptly and effectively. It can also lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Cirrhosis of the Liver: This condition can cause portal hypertension, esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, and an increased risk of infections.
4. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, there is a risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which can potentially dislodge and cause a pulmonary embolism.
6. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers due to the critical illness and the medications he is receiving. Prophylactic medications may be needed to prevent gastric ulcers.
7. Glycemic Control: Maintaining normal blood glucose levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and HCV, pulmonary hypertension, severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy. He was admitted to the SICU after an aborted liver transplant due to elevated pulmonary pressures. He is currently in the ICU for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's main medical issues include pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), acute renal failure (ARF), and cirrhosis of the liver (alcoholic).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has signs of elevated left-sided pressure on PA catheter, suggesting volume overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening of pulmonary hypertension.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of recurrent encephalopathy, which can be triggered by factors such as infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, or medication noncompliance. Monitoring for changes in mental status and hepatic encephalopathy symptoms is important.
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): Given the patient's cirrhosis and ascites, he is at an increased risk for SBP. Daily abdominal examination and monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a concern for further deterioration in kidney function. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustments in fluid and medication management are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and hepatitis C, pulmonary hypertension, severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy. He was admitted to the SICU after an aborted liver transplant due to elevated pulmonary pressures. He has been transferred to the MICU for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's current conditions include pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, and cirrhosis of the liver.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has elevated left-sided pressure on PA catheter, suggesting possible volume overload. The goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of approximately 1000 mL per day.
2. Liver Failure: The patient has cirrhosis and liver failure with a MELD score of 34-36. He is at risk for complications such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is thought to be secondary to volume overload and hepatorenal syndrome. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance, and renal function will be closely monitored.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension with mean PA pressure of 52 and wedge pressure of 28. He requires further evaluation and management, possibly including the use of Flolan therapy.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C, pulmonary hypertension, severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy. He was admitted to the SICU post-aborted liver transplant due to elevated pulmonary pressures and is now transferred to the MICU for diuresis while on a Swan-Ganz catheter, with possible consideration of Flolan therapy.

The patient's medical conditions include pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and hypothyroidism. He also has anemia, a sacral ulcer, and a history of diverticulosis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 111/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals jaundice, muscle wasting, and warm skin.

The patient's lab results show elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin levels, and abnormal renal function tests.

   severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy, admitted to SICU post
   aborted liver trx due to elevation in pulmonary pressures. He is now
   transferred to medicine for diuresis, treatment of acute renal failure
   and pulmonary hypertension, and transferred to MICU for diuresis while
   Swan in place, with possible consideration of Flolan therapy.
   # Volume Status: elevated left sided pressure on PA catheter, so
   suspect volume overload.  Currently on Lasix gtt. Negative ~ I L
   yesterday. BNP today 2636 down from 4269 down from 6572.
   - Goal -1000-[**2138**] ml today
   - PM lytes
   - Lasix gtt & consider Diural if needed
   - PA pressures/wedge did not seem to correlate well with CVP
   - Daily BNP
s to see how they correlate with CVP to try to be able to
   move away from PA catheter: BNP has gone from 6000 to 4000 to [**2138**].
   Follow BNP as surrogate marker of volume status once Swan pulled.

   # Pulmonary hypertension:  plan at time of transfer from SICU was
   diuresis with goal to lower pulmonary pressures; it was felt at time
   that volume overload was contributing to elevated PA pressures (which
   were increased from cardiac cath in [**Month (only) 25**]).  In MICU for continued
   diuresis (watching the creatinine) in preparation for possible Flolan

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension and is currently being treated for it in the ICU. The mean PA pressure of 52 with wedge pressure of 28 indicates elevated pulmonary pressures.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is thought to be secondary to volume overload and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Diuretic therapy has been initiated but is being cautiously managed due to worsening renal function.

3. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis, as indicated by a history of excessive alcohol consumption and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This condition leads to complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, and potential spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function that occurs as a result of severe liver disease. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin.

5. SBP Prophylaxis: The patient is on ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis to prevent infection in the presence of cirrhosis and ascites.

6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, for which they are receiving outpatient Synthroid therapy.

7. Anemia: The patient has normoc"
