   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 67 year old male with h/o CAD and s/p MI in [**2123**] without
   successful intervention who was found down by EMS who initiated CPR.
   Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for revascularization.
   .
   # CORONARIES: CEs continue to trend up with troponin 0.46, MB 24, MBI
   9.2, CK 260. Two possible scenarios could explain these findings: 1)
   scar related vfib + NSTEMI or 2) scar related vfib + hypopoperfusion
   leading to myonecrosis.  Given ccath last night did not indicate any
   new active clot scenario #2 would seem more plausible unless there was
   a smaller more discrete vessel affected. Heparin gtt initiated this am
   without bolus given concern for possible ACS.
   - Consider repeat cardiac cath
   - Cont hypothermia protocol: pt reached optimal cooling temp at 0100
   - Cont to trend CE until they peak.
   - d/c Amiodarone gtt
   - Cont wean Nitro gtt to off
   - d/c Nifedipine gtt
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively
   - ECHO today
   -hold Heparin gtt for now until CT-head
   - plan for CT-head
   - pull sheath today
   .
   # PUMP: Patient remains euvolemic and is -800 mL overnight.
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - ECHO in am as per above
   - BP control as per above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia with occasional PVCs. Bradycardia likely
   [**2-5**] hypothermia.
   - Cont Amiodarone gtt
   - Will likely require long term anticoagulation following resolution of
   acute issues (transient AF and h/o TIA)
   - Monitor on tele
   - Atropine at bedside
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient remains sedated and hypothermic.
   - Attempt to wean sedation following completion of hypothermia protocol
   .
   # Hypertension: BP much improved on nitro and nifedipine drips.
   - Cont nifedipine gtt
   - Cont nitro gtt PRN and wean to off today
   - Hold outpatient regimen of ACE for now
   .
   #. C-spine: Pt was reportly found down. Placed in c-collar.
   - CT c-spine, head
   - clear collar when off sedation
   # H/O TIA vs Stroke: Per family patient has no residual effects of this
   event. Given this history and possibility of afib patient would qualify
   for long term anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-inch obese Caucasian male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient has been on various medications including nitroglycerin, cisatracurium, fentanyl, and midazolam. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating with readings ranging from 112/48 mmHg to 158/87 mmHg. The patient's heart rate has been consistently low, ranging from 46-52 bpm. Oxygen saturation has remained at 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 245, and a respiratory rate of 10.6 L/min.

Physical examination reveals an obese male with no signs of pallor, cyanosis, or jugular venous distention due to the c-collar in place. The patient's cardiac examination shows a point of maximal impulse (PMI) in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. There are no murmurs, gallops, or lifts detected. The patient's lung fields are clear with audible mechanical ventilation. No femoral bruits are appreciated. The patient's skin is described as normal without any stasis dermatitis, ulcers,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-inch tall individual who presented with a chief complaint of cardiac arrest. Upon admission, the patient was hypertensive and received treatment with nitro gtt and labetolol gtt. Labetolol was discontinued and nifedipine was started, resulting in a response in blood pressure. The patient also started on a hypothermic protocol and had a subclavian line placed. Amio gtt was initiated, and a chest X-ray revealed a widened mediastinum, believed to be due to engorged vasculature. Lasix administration was considered but the patient was self-diuresing well. Heparin gtt was started in the morning and continues to be administered. 

Allergies, last dose of antibiotics, and current infusions are documented. Other medications include Labetalol, Fentanyl, Cisatracurium, and Midazolam. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for specific noted changes. 

Vital signs include a heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/48 to 158/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 209 mL and 729 mL since 12 AM, with total output of 1050 mL and 1900 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 67 year old male with h/o CAD and s/p MI in [**2123**] without
   successful intervention who was found down by EMS who initiated CPR.
   Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for revascularization.
   .
   # CORONARIES: CEs continue to trend up with troponin 0.46, MB 24, MBI
   9.2, CK 260. Two possible scenarios could explain these findings: 1)
   scar related vfib + NSTEMI or 2) scar related vfib + hypopoperfusion
   leading to myonecrosis.  Given ccath last night did not indicate any
   new active clot scenario #2 would seem more plausible unless there was
   a smaller more discrete vessel affected. Heparin gtt initiated this am
   without bolus given concern for possible ACS.
   - Consider repeat cardiac cath
   - Cont hypothermia protocol: pt reached optimal cooling temp at 0100
   - Cont to trend CE until they peak.
   - d/c Amiodarone gtt
   - Cont wean Nitro gtt to off
   - d/c Nifedipine gtt
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively
   - ECHO today
   -hold Heparin gtt for now until CT-head
   - plan for CT-head
   - pull sheath today
   .
   # PUMP: Patient remains euvolemic and is -800 mL overnight.
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - ECHO in am as per above
   - BP control as per above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia with occasional PVCs. Bradycardia likely
   [**2-5**] hypothermia.
   - Cont Amiodarone gtt
   - Will likely require long term anticoagulation following resolution of
   acute issues (transient AF and h/o TIA)
   - Monitor on tele
   - Atropine at bedside
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient remains sedated and hypothermic.
   - Attempt to wean sedation following completion of hypothermia protocol
   .
   # Hypertension: BP much improved on nitro and nifedipine drips.
   - Cont nifedipine gtt
   - Cont nitro gtt PRN and wean to off today
   - Hold outpatient regimen of ACE for now
   .
   #. C-spine: Pt was reportly found down. Placed in c-collar.
   - CT c-spine, head
   - clear collar when off sedation
   # H/O TIA vs Stroke: Per family patient has no residual effects of this
   event. Given this history and possibility of afib patient would qualify
   for long term anticoagulation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who experienced a cardiac arrest and was found down by EMS. The patient was resuscitated and transferred to the hospital for revascularization.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been much improved on nitro and nifedipine drips. The plan is to continue nifedipine gtt, wean nitro gtt PRN, and eventually turn off the nitro drip today. The outpatient regimen of ACE inhibitors should be held for now.

2. Cardiac rhythm: The patient is in sinus bradycardia with occasional PVCs. This bradycardia is likely due to hypothermia. Continuous amiodarone gtt should be maintained, and long-term anticoagulation may be required due to transient atrial fibrillation (AF) and a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA).

3. Altered mental status: The patient remains sedated and hypothermic. After completion of the hypothermia protocol, an attempt can be made to wean sedation.

4. C-spine: The patient was reportedly found down, and a c-collar has been placed. A CT c-spine and head should be performed, and the clear collar should be used when the patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 67 year old male with h/o CAD and s/p MI in [**2123**] without
   successful intervention who was found down by EMS who initiated CPR.
   Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for revascularization.
   .
   # CORONARIES: CEs continue to trend up with troponin 0.46, MB 24, MBI
   9.2, CK 260. Two possible scenarios could explain these findings: 1)
   scar related vfib + NSTEMI or 2) scar related vfib + hypopoperfusion
   leading to myonecrosis.  Given ccath last night did not indicate any
   new active clot scenario #2 would seem more plausible unless there was
   a smaller more discrete vessel affected. Heparin gtt initiated this am
   without bolus given concern for possible ACS.
   - Consider repeat cardiac cath
   - Cont hypothermia protocol: pt reached optimal cooling temp at 0100
   - Cont to trend CE until they peak.
   - Cont Amiodarone gtt : should be 0.5 mg/kg/min
   - Cont wean Nitro gtt to off
   - Cont Nifedipine gtt for BP control
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively
   - ECHO today
   -Cont Heparin gtt for now
   .
   # PUMP: Patient remains euvolemic and is -800 mL overnight.
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - ECHO in am as per above
   - BP control as per above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia with occasional PVCs. Bradycardia likely
   [**2-5**] hypothermia.
   - Cont Amiodarone gtt
   - Will likely require long term anticoagulation following resolution of
   acute issues
   - Monitor on tele
   - Atropine at bedside
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient remains sedated and hypothermic.
   - Attempt to wean sedation following completion of hypothermia protocol
   .
   # Hypertension: BP much improved on nitro and nifedipine drips.
   - Cont nifedipine gtt
   - Cont nitro gtt PRN and wean to off today
   - Hold outpatient regimen of ACE for now
   .
   # H/O TIA vs Stroke: Per family patient has no residual effects of this
   event. Given this history and possibility of afib patient would qualify
   for long term anticoagulation.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a previous myocardial infarction (MI) who was found unconscious and initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient has been admitted to the ICU for revascularization.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 52 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 112/48 mmHg to 158/87 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 18, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%.

The patient has been started on hypothermia protocol and is currently at the optimal cooling temperature. He is also receiving amiodarone, nitroglycerin, labetalol, and nifedipine infusions. 

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hb), elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who experienced a cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated by emergency medical services and transferred to the hospital for revascularization. The patient has undergone a cooling protocol and is currently rewarming. Sheath and arterial lines have been stopped, and the patient's blood products, urine output, and fluid balance are being monitored. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP mode. His oxygen saturation is at 97% and ABG results are pending. An echo shows moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe focal hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls. The patient's ejection fraction is 35%. His blood glucose levels indicate uncontrolled diabetes, and he requires outpatient management. The patient's hypertension has resolved, but he is now bordering on hypotension. His respiratory status has improved, and he is expected to be extubated today. The patient's altered mental status is improving, and he is now alert and responsive. A head CT shows no acute process. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and his creatinine levels have increased from 0.9 to 1.3. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and may require long-term anticoagulation. The patient's medical history includes myocardial infarction in 2023 without successful intervention. The plan includes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction, who experienced cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. The patient has been in the ICU since admission. 

Key findings and assessments:
- The patient's skin integrity is impaired.
- The patient has hyperglycemia, with fasting blood glucose levels in the 300s.
- The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as evidenced by an ejection fraction of 35% and severe hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls.
- The patient's altered mental status has improved, and he is now alert and responsive.
- The patient's hypertension has resolved but is now bordering on hypotension.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is now on CPAP with 40% FiO2.
- The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension.
- The patient likely needs long-term anticoagulation due to a history of TIA vs stroke.
- The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for pressure ulcers, infections, and other complications associated with immobility.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high fasting blood glucose levels indicate uncontrolled diabetes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He experienced a cardiac arrest and was found down by EMS. The patient was resuscitated and transferred to the hospital for revascularization. Since admission, the patient has been managed in the ICU due to multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated fasting blood glucose levels, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. This could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac function is compromised with reduced ejection fraction and regional wall motion abnormalities. There is a risk of recurrent cardiac events or progression of heart failure.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient initially had altered mental status, which is now improving. However, there is still a need for ongoing neurological evaluation and management.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating between hypertension and hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary to maintain stable hemodynamics.
6. Respiratory Status: The patient required mechanical ventilation initially but is now on CPAP with supplemental oxygen. Weaning off respiratory support should be done cautiously.
7. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has developed acute kidney injury, which may be related"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction who was found down by EMS. He was successfully resuscitated and transferred to the hospital for revascularization. The patient has been in the ICU since then and has shown improvement in his respiratory status, now on CPAP with 40% FiO2. He is alert and responsive, with no acute processes seen on head CT. However, he has several ongoing issues including severe hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls of the heart, euvolemia, hypertension that has resolved but is now bordering on hypotension, altered mental status, renal failure, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction: The patient's history of CAD and previous MI puts him at risk for further cardiac events such as recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
2. Severe hypokinesis of the heart: The severe hypokinesis indicates reduced pumping ability of the heart, which can lead to heart failure and subsequent symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs, potentially causing organ dysfunction or failure.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various reasons including hypoxia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction who experienced cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated by EMS and transferred to the hospital for revascularization. The patient underwent cooling protocol and rewarming started at 8pm. Sheath was pulled without complications, and arterial line was removed. The patient's FiO2 was decreased to 40% and switched to CPAP, with sats > 97%. A head CT showed no acute process, but there was a small right parietal subgaleal hematoma. An ECG showed severe hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls with an ejection fraction of 35%. Neurology initiated EEG monitoring. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and possible atrial fibrillation. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 93/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and awake, alert, and responding to commands. Physical examination findings are within normal limits except for the presence of a PMI and absent JVP due to the c-collar in place. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood glucose, and troponin-T levels. Assessment and plan include management of coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M with h/o CAD s/p MI in [**2123**] without successful intervention,
   who was found down by EMS who initiated CPR and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]
   for revascularization.
   1. Coronaries. s/p cooling protocol. O/N complained of CP; remained
   hemodynamically stable, no SOB. EKG during episode showed change in
   RBBB morphology but now ST/T changes. Started nitro gtt and increased
   heparin gtt. Also cannot r/o MSK pain r/t CPR. On exam, reports CP on
   palpation of chest. CEs this morning show CK trending back up, 144 ->
   298.
   - follow CEs
   - Monitor on tele
   - d/c heparin gtt given drop in Hct
   - d/c nitro gtt
   - Cont ASA, statin
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively
   2. PUMP: Echo shows EF 35%, dilated atria, severe hypokinesis of
   inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls. Clinically slightly
   volume up and +1.5L since yesterday. Has not been diuresed yet because
   of low BPs. Will likely require maintenance diuresis for CHF.
   - repeat CXR
   - cont metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow BPs today, goal TBB even with gentle diuresis
   - No ACE for now given low BPs
   3. RHYTHM: Stable since admission with occasional PVCs.
   - Cardiac MRI
   - Discuss possible ICD placement with EP
   - Will likely require long-term anticoagulation following resolution of
   acute issues given Afib on admission
   - Monitor on tele
   4. Anemia: Rapid drop in Hct is concerning. Baseline 44 three days ago,
   then 38 yesterday, now 33.8. No BRBPR, no hemoptysis, no acute mental
   status change, no abd tenderness, no groin or sternal hematoma.
   However, lungs are wet and abdomen is distended. s/p cath therefore
   can
t r/o RP bleed.
   - CT-scan to r/o RP bleed
   - Guaiac today
   - T&C done, 3 units ready
   - 18g PIVs in place
   5. Altered Mental Status: Alert x2 (
deaconness, [**2106**], [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **]
   and responsive. Exam unchanged from yesterday. Per neuro rec yesterday,
   no immediate issues.
   6. Respiratory status: Extubated, satting 100% on 4L NC. SaO2 drops
   quickly on sitting up.
   7. ARF: Stable since yesterday. Likely related to poor forward flow,
   will likely resolve as hemodynamics improve.
   - Will trend cre as acute issues resolve.
   8. Hyperglycemia: FSBGs in 160-220s. Will titrate insulin prn
   FEN: NPO for now, replete electrolytes.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 335**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Excellent neuro recovery with fluent speech and conversation.
   Concerned about HCT drop 44 to 33.
   Chest pain at 2 AM persisting this AM with no significant enzyme
   change, most likely pain from CPR.
   Physical Examination
   alert, cooperative
   Medical Decision Making
   Will check abd ct to r/o RP bleed.
   Plans per EP service re ablation or AICD.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 322**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2125-6-14**] 14:44 ------
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who experienced a myocardial infarction in 2023 without successful intervention. The patient was found down by EMS and initiated CPR before being transferred to the hospital for revascularization.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Coronaries: The patient complained of chest pain overnight but remained hemodynamically stable without shortness of breath. An EKG during the episode showed changes in the right bundle branch block morphology but no ST/T changes. Nitroglycerin and increased heparin were started. The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are trending back up from 144 to 298.

Plan:
- Follow CK trends
- Monitor on tele
- Discontinue heparin gtt given drop in hematocrit (Hct)
- Discontinue nitro gtt
- Continue aspirin and statin therapy
- Aggressively replete electrolytes

2. PUMP: An echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, dilated atria, and severe hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls. The patient is slightly volume overloaded and +1.5 liters since yesterday. Diuresis has not been initiated yet due to low blood pressures. The patient will likely require maintenance diuresis for congestive heart failure.

Plan:
- Repeat chest X"

   67 yo M with h/o CAD s/p MI in [**2123**] without successful intervention,
   who was found down by EMS who initiated CPR and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]
   for revascularization.
   1. Coronaries. s/p cooling protocol. O/N complained of CP; remained
   hemodynamically stable, no SOB. No new ST changes on EKG but ?
   worsening RBBB. Etiology MSK pain from CPR vs ischemia vs pulmonary
   process. On exam, reported CP on palpation of chest. Ces this morning
   show CK trending back up, 144 -> 298.
   - follow CEs
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cont ASA, statin
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively
   2. PUMP: Echo shows EF 35%, dilated atria, severe hypokinesis of
   inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls. Clinically euvolemic
   and -1L so far. Will likely require maintenance diuresis for CHF.
   - Follow BPs today; fluid bolus if hypotensive
   - No diuresis for now given low BPs
   - No ACE for now given low BPs
   3. RHYTHM: Stable since admission with occasional PVCs.
   - Discuss possible ICD placement with EP
   - Will likely require long-term anticoagulation following resolution of
   acute issues given Afib on admission
   - Monitor on tele
   4. Altered Mental Status: Weaning sedation today, pt is now alert and
   responsive. Head CT shows no acute process.
   - Follow neuro rec's after EEG today
   - Continue to wean sedation today
   - Restraints for now as he recovers baseline status
   5. Hypertension: Resolved; now bordering on hypotension.
   - Follow BPs today, consider fluid bolus if needed.
   6. Respiratory status: Much improved. Now on CPAP with 40% FiO2.
   - Extubate today
   7. ARF: New this AM. Likely related to poor forward flow given likely
   new pump problems and hypotension this morning.
   - Will trend cre as acute issues resolve.
   8. h/o TIA vs Stroke:
   - likely long-term anticoagulation after resolution of acute process
   9. Hyperglycemia: HbA1c of 8.3 indicating pt likely has type II
   diabetes and will require outpatient management.
   - FSBGs in 300s. Will start basal insulin and continue SSI.
   FEN: NPO for now, replete electrolytes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) in [**2123**] without successful intervention.
- He was found down by EMS and initiated CPR before being transferred to [**Hospital1**] for revascularization.
- The patient complained of chest pain (CP) overnight but remained hemodynamically stable without shortness of breath (SOB).
- EKG showed no new ST changes but worsening right bundle branch block (RBBB).
- The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are trending back up from 144 to 298.
- The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 35%, and an echocardiogram shows severe hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls.
- The patient is clinically euvolemic and has received a fluid bolus.
- Diuretics may be required for congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient's rhythm is stable with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
- Possible implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement and long-term anticoagulation will be discussed with an electrophysiologist (EP).
- The patient's altered mental status has improved, and he is now alert and responsive.
- Head CT shows no acute process.
- Sedation will continue to be weaned today,"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M with h/o CAD s/p MI in [**2123**] without successful intervention,
   who was found down by EMS who initiated CPR and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]
   for revascularization.
   1. Coronaries. s/p cooling protocol. O/N complained of CP; remained
   hemodynamically stable, no SOB. EKG during episode showed change in
   RBBB morphology but now ST/T changes. Started nitro gtt and increased
   heparin gtt. Also cannot r/o MSK pain r/t CPR. On exam, reports CP on
   palpation of chest. CEs this morning show CK trending back up, 144 ->
   298.
   - follow CEs
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cont heparin and nitro gtt
   - Cont ASA, statin
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively
   2. PUMP: Echo shows EF 35%, dilated atria, severe hypokinesis of
   inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls. Clinically slightly
   volume up and +1.5L since yesterday. Has not been diuresed yet because
   of low BPs. Will likely require maintenance diuresis for CHF.
   - Follow BPs today
   - No diuresis for now given low BPs
   - No ACE for now given low BPs
   3. RHYTHM: Stable since admission with occasional PVCs.
   - Discuss possible ICD placement with EP
   - Will likely require long-term anticoagulation following resolution of
   acute issues given Afib on admission
   - Monitor on tele
   4. Altered Mental Status: Weaning sedation today, pt is now alert and
   responsive. Head CT shows no acute process.
   - Follow neuro rec's after EEG today
   - Continue to wean sedation today
   - Restraints for now as he recovers baseline status
   5. Hypertension: Resolved; now bordering on hypotension.
   - Follow BPs today, consider fluid bolus if needed.
   6. Respiratory status: Much improved. Now on CPAP with 40% FiO2.
   - Extubate today
   7. ARF: New this AM. Likely related to poor forward flow given likely
   new pump problems and hypotension this morning.
   - Will trend cre as acute issues resolve.
   8. h/o TIA vs Stroke:
   - likely long-term anticoagulation after resolution of acute process
   9. Hyperglycemia: HbA1c of 8.3 indicating pt likely has type II
   diabetes and will require outpatient management.
   - FSBGs in 300s. Will start basal insulin and continue SSI.
   FEN: NPO for now, replete electrolytes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented to the hospital after being found down by EMS. He underwent CPR and revascularization at Hospital1. The patient has been in the ICU since admission and has had several medical complications. His current condition includes invasive ventilation, cardiac issues, altered mental status, hypertension, respiratory status improvement, acute renal failure, history of transient ischemic attack versus stroke, hyperglycemia, and potential medication allergies. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently on CPAP with 40% FiO2. He has been weaned off sedation and is alert and responsive. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, and elevated troponin T levels. His echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 35% and severe hypokinesis of inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls. The patient requires close monitoring, ongoing management of his cardiac condition, and further evaluation for long-term anticoagulation and possible ICD placement."

   # RHYTHM: ECG from OSH with Afib versus sinus with PACs. No h/o Afib
   per family. Patient currently in sinus rhythm. As noted above, EMS
   found patient in VFib. Recognize that cooling often leads to
   bradycardia.
   - Cont Amiodarone gtt
   - Will likely require long term anticoagulation following resolution of
   acute issues
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient currently sedated and hypothermic. On
   arrival at scene EMS recorded [**Location (un) 6520**] coma scale as 3. Patient was
   intubated, paralyzed and sedated by EMS en route to OSH. Given we have
   not given sedation a chance to wear off mental status can not be
   assessed at this time. Will have to wait until cooling process is
   complete.
   - Attempt to wean sedation in am following hypothermia protocol
   - Consider Head CT if pressures remain elevated to r/o herniation
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient hypertensive with SBPs in the 200's in the cath
   lab. On transfer he was normotensive. Pressures have responded to nitro
   and labetolol gtts. Possible etiology includes anoxic brain injury [**2-5**]
   increased ICP versus cardiogenic shock.
   - Labetolol DC'd and changed to nifedipine gtt
   - Cont nitro gtt PRN and wean off when pressure stabilizes
   - Hold outpatient regimen of ACE for now
   .
   # H/O TIA vs Stroke: Per family patient has no residual effects of this
   event. Given this history and possibility of afib patient would qualify
   for long term anticoagulation.
   .
   .
   FEN: NPO for now
   ACCESS: PIV's, left subclavian central line
   PROPHYLAXIS: received heparin in cath lab and has therapeutic PTT. Will
   determine need for anticoagulation based on CE trend.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who was found down by EMS and initiated CPR. The patient was transferred to Hospital1 for revascularization. On arrival, ECG showed ST elevations versus old right bundle branch block, and intervention radiology only located chronic occlusion with PCI.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: On arrival to OSH ECG showed ST elevations versus old right bundle branch block. Interventional radiology only able to locate chronic occlusion with PCI.
- Continue hypothermia protocol
- Continue to trend CE every 6 hours. If enzymes continue to trend up, consider starting heparin and integrilin gtts.
- Amiodarone gtt to prevent tachyarrhythmias
- Nitro gtt for BP control
- Nifedipine gtt for BP control
- Replete electrolytes aggressively
- Repeat an ECG in am
- ECHO in am to assess for WMAs

2. Pump: No history of heart failure and no previous ECHOs available. Patient appears euvolemic though CXR noted to have widened mediastinum and plump vasculature. Likely his preceding symptoms of fatigue and DOE related to angina rather than heart failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who was found unconscious by EMS. He was resuscitated and transferred to the hospital for revascularization. The patient has been in the ICU since then.

24-hour events:
- The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated.
- An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no issues.
- The patient's neurologic deficits, including clumsiness, memory, and cognitive impairment, will require long-term follow-up.
- The patient's input/output (I/O) check goal was -500 cc, but they had a positive balance of +300 cc at midnight.
- Around 2 am, the patient complained of mild chest pain (CP). An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and more prominent right bundle branch block (RBBB), with no new ST changes. As the patient was previously CP-free and no intervention was done on the catheter (2VD LAD, LCx nearly completely occluded), the patient was restarted on nitroglycerin (NTG) gtt and heparin gtt, and a new cardiac enzyme (CE) panel was sent for trending.
- The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level increased from 144 to 298.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) in [**2123**] without successful intervention. He was found down by EMS and initiated CPR before being transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for revascularization. 

The patient's recent events include invasive ventilation that was stopped on [**2125-6-13**] at 10:30 AM, and he was extubated with cleared cervical spine. EEG results showed no issues. The patient has mild neuro deficits (clumsiness, memory, cognitive) and an input/output check goal of -500 cc with a current output of +300 at Minnesota. 

Around 2 AM, the patient complained of mild chest pain (CP). EKG showed frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and more prominent right bundle branch block (RBBB), with no new ST changes. Since the patient was previously CP-free and no intervention was done on the cath (2VD LAD, Lcx nearly completely occluded), the patient was restarted on nitroglycerin (NTG) gtt and heparin gtt. 

The patient's allergies include penicillins, with a last dose of antibiotics being an infusion. The patient is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and nitroglycerin. Other ICU medications are not specified.

- He was found down by EMS and initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), then transferred to Hospital1 for revascularization.
- The patient complained of chest pain (CP) overnight and had changes in RBBB morphology on EKG, but no ST/T changes. Nitroglycerin and heparin infusions were started.
- His creatine kinase (CK) levels are increasing, indicating possible cardiac injury.
- The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 35% and dilated atria on echocardiogram, suggesting heart failure.
- He is slightly volume overloaded and has not been diuresed yet due to low blood pressures.
- The patient has occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) but has been hemodynamically stable.
- There is a rapid drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 44% to 33.8%, which is concerning. No bleeding symptoms are present, but further evaluation for possible retroperitoneal bleed is planned.
- The patient's mental status is altered, but he is alert and oriented. No immediate neurologic issues were identified.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He experienced cardiac arrest three days ago and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the field. He was transferred to Hospital1 and underwent a cooling protocol. On admission, the patient received two additional doses of metoprolol for tachycardia. His chest X-ray showed contusions consistent with manual chest compressions. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 70 bpm (range: 57-119 bpm), blood pressure of 105/69 mmHg (range: 77-142/90-102 mmHg), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (range: 11-24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus rhythm. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and an overweight/obese body habitus. His peripheral pulses are diminished in both the right and left distal pulses. The abdominal examination shows distention but is otherwise unremarkable. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit levels ranging from 28% to 36%, platelet count within normal range, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal kidney function tests including elevated creat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He experienced cardiac arrest 3 days ago and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the field. The patient was then transferred to Hospital 1 and underwent a cooling protocol. On admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable, with high heart rate and blood pressure fluctuations. He received multiple doses of metoprolol for tachycardia. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing episodes of sinus tachycardia and occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). There are plans for ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation next week and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation later. The patient's anemia has slightly improved, and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not show any bleeding. His mental status has improved, and his respiratory status is stable. Acute kidney injury (ARF) has resolved, and his blood glucose levels are within target range. An incidental finding of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a largest diameter of 4.7cm was noted on the CT scan, and the patient is recommended for outpatient follow-up. The patient is currently on heparin subcutaneously and pantoprazole. Disposition will be determined based on further evaluation and stabilization of the patient's condition."

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who experienced cardiac arrest three days ago. He received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the field and was transferred to Hospital1, where he underwent cooling protocol treatment. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, pain control, anemia, ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, and cardiac arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease (CAD) - The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of future cardiovascular events such as angina, myocardial infarction, or heart failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias - The patient has experienced episodes of sinus tachycardia and occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). These arrhythmias may progress to more serious forms like ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), which can lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Impaired skin integrity - The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores, which can become infected and lead to cellulitis or sepsis.
4. Anemia - The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
5. Hyperglycemia - The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate"
