           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion.
   BLOOD CULTURE: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock
   , hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   Improved yesterday but worsened again this AM, back on levophed this
   morning. [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2
   species ([**1-7**] pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It
   is unclear where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here
   still pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due
   to staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is satting well
   on NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc and cefepime
   - discontinue azithromycin as pt does not seem to have lung infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Follow lactate
   -  Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - consider ECHO to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improving with IVF. The most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. She continues to have free water deficit of 3.3 liter
   today.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to be fully respiratorily compensated at present
   without any additional non-gap or respiratory process. Should she
   appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will need to
   consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed withoug moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting
   of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 151**]

   IMAGING: CXR today: my read: no acute cardiopulmonary process. RML
   opacity seen yesterday has resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female with history of chronic renal
   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation
   - Follow pulses
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive:
   Per daughter, has had marked decline over the last several months,
   worsening over the last several days. Poor PO intake.
   Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting of underlying
   dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) FEN:
   - IVF as noted above, bolusing as need to maintain MAP, following
   electrolytes.
   - Monitoring and repleting electrolytes as discussed above.
   - NPO for now
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   .
   #) Access: Currently has femoral triple lumen and one 20 gage
   peripheral
   - Femoral line will need to be resited to non-femoral site
   .
   #) Code:  Full--called daughter and updated her and discussed recent
   events. Per daughter, patient is full code. The family wished to hold
   off on intubation for purposes of the CT scan downstairs, but would
   want intubation if has respiratory decline. Daughter will come in very
   soon to talk about this further.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and hypertension. She presents with hypotension, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and worsening renal function. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely of urinary origin, with possible involvement of the gastrointestinal or pulmonary systems. She also has hypernatremia, acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency, metabolic acidosis, anemia, elevated troponin levels, and an enlarged abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient's mental status has declined over the past few months and she is at risk for failure to thrive. She is being managed with IV fluids, antibiotics, vasopressors, and other supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is worsening, indicating the possibility of AKI. This could be due to pre-renal causes, intrinsic renal injury, or post-renal obstruction.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, which needs to be corrected. If left untreated, it can lead to further organ dysfunction.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hyper"

   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and hypertension. She presents with hypotension, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and worsening renal function. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely of urinary origin, and is being treated with fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressors. Other potential complications include cardiogenic shock, pulmonary embolism, and acute tubular necrosis. The patient also has hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, elevated troponin levels, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm. She is experiencing mental status changes and failure to thrive. The patient is currently receiving ICU-level care with multiple IV lines, prophylactic heparin, and NPO status. Code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It is important to continue aggressive treatment with fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressors to manage this condition.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's history of heart failure and hypotension, there is a concern for cardiogenic shock. This condition occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female with history of chronic renal
   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   - ECHO to r/o endocarditis in presence of coag-neg staph
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive:
   Per daughter, has had marked decline over the last several months,
   worsening over the last several days. Poor PO intake.
   Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting of underlying
   dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) FEN:
   - IVF as noted above, bolusing as need to maintain MAP, following
   electrolytes.
   - Monitoring and repleting electrolytes as discussed above.
   - NPO for now
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and hypertension. She presents with hypotension, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and worsening renal function. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions for multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient fits the criteria for sepsis, with a suspected urinary tract infection as the source. She has been given liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in the emergency department. Other possibilities include cardiogenic shock or pulmonary embolism.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a history of hypovolemia, which is likely the cause of her hypernatremia. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters, and she needs careful correction of her sodium levels.
3. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is around 1.5, and it has risen to 3.0 with elevated BUN. This suggests a multifactorial cause, including pre-renal low intravascular state, continuation of lasix and lisinopril, and possible acute tubular necrosis.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap of 17, possibly higher due to pending albumin. The underlying processes contributing to her acidosis include acute renal failure"

           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion.
   BLOOD CULTURE: NGTD
   IMAGING: CXR today: my read: no acute cardiopulmonary process. RML
   opacity seen yesterday has resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female with history of chronic renal
   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation
   - Follow pulses
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive:
   Per daughter, has had marked decline over the last several months,
   worsening over the last several days. Poor PO intake.
   Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting of underlying
   dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) FEN:
   - IVF as noted above, bolusing as need to maintain MAP, following
   electrolytes.
   - Monitoring and repleting electrolytes as discussed above.
   - NPO for now
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   .
   #) Access: Currently has femoral triple lumen and one 20 gage
   peripheral
   - Femoral line will need to be resited to non-femoral site
   .
   #) Code:  Full--called daughter and updated her and discussed recent
   events. Per daughter, patient is full code. The family wished to hold
   off on intubation for purposes of the CT scan downstairs, but would
   want intubation if has respiratory decline. Daughter will come in very
   soon to talk about this further.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and hypertension. She presents with hypotension, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and worsening renal function. 

The patient is diagnosed with sepsis, likely originating from a urinary tract infection, but other sources such as gastrointestinal or pulmonary infections are also possible. She has been given liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in the emergency department. A central venous line was placed, but it needs to be replaced at a non-femoral site.

The patient also has hypernatremia, possibly due to hypovolemia, and a free water deficit of approximately 4 liters. The goal correction rate is 0.5 mEq/hour. Serum and urine osmolarity, as well as urine electrolytes, should be monitored.

The patient's acute renal failure is multifactorial, involving pre-renal low intravascular state, continuation of lasix and lisinopril, and possible acute tubular necrosis. Holding antihypertensives, continuing hydration, and following creatinine trends are recommended.

The patient has metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 17, possibly higher due to pending albumin levels. Causes include acute renal failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She is fully respiratorily compensated at present, but should she"

   unable to cooperate with CVL limiting our ability to follow cvp or svo2

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including dementia, who presented with septic shock. She has been critically ill and experiencing several complications. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with recurrent hypotension and hypothermia. She has been receiving aggressive IV fluids and pressors to maintain her blood pressure. The patient has been diagnosed with several infections, including Staphylococcus aureus in her bladder catheter, and is being treated with multiple antibiotics. Her renal function is impaired, possibly due to pre-renal causes, ongoing medications, and sepsis. The patient also has elevated cardiac enzymes and a history of myocardial infarction. She is unable to cooperate with neurological evaluations. The patient's sodium levels are high, and she has metabolic acidosis. The patient's mental status has declined, and she is at high risk for further deterioration. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her family wishes to continue aggressive care. Palliative care and spiritual support have been requested.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock and is still at risk for further infection and septic complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to pre-renal causes, ongoing medications, and sepsis. This increases the risk of developing AKI or worsening of renal function.
3. Myocardial Infar"

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including MMM (multi-morbidity metabolic syndrome), presenting with septic shock, hypotension, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury (ARF) on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRI), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/demand ischemia, and altered mental status on underlying dementia. 

The patient initially presented with profound dehydration and was given aggressive intravenous fluids (IVFs). Despite initial improvement and weaning off pressors, the patient's condition deteriorated, with recurrent hypotension/hypothermia and a drop in urine output. Levophed was restarted. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), lactate levels, and troponin T. Other lab values indicate renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated cardiac markers. 

The patient's fluid analysis shows improvement in lactate levels and albumin levels. Microbiology results from urine culture are negative for growth. Blood cultures from the open surgical wound (OSH) are positive for Staphylococcus aureus. 

The patient is being treated for septic shock with aggressive IVFs, maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) > 60, and attempting to wean off levophed. Antibiotics have been initiated, and surveillance cultures are being sent.

   Agree with plan to treat for septic shock with aggressive IVFs,
   maintaining MAPS > 60 attempting to again wean off levophed.  Pt is
   unable to cooperate with CVL limiting our ability to follow cvp or svo2
   to further guide resus. Overnight her lactate normalized and cr has
   been decreasing.  Will continue to monitor abgs, ph, and lactate
   levels.  She now has a NGMA--from diarrhea and NS. Will use LR for
   IVFs. Will con't vanco, cefe and flagyl for now pending additional cx
   data. Her diarrhea is minimal but we will cover empirically for c diff
   and follow abd exam. She has been oxygenating well, with neg urine lg,
   lower suspicion for pna/atypical pna
can d/c azithro.  Will check TTE
   to assess for SBE and send surveillance cx given CNS bactermeia. Her na
   is improving and we continue to replete free water deficit.  ARF is
   likely multifactorial in etiology
prerenal from profound dehydration,
   onoging meds (lasix and lisinopri), low flow state in setting of known
   AS, as well as sepsis with probable ATN.  Cr and urine outpt

   be multiple potential causes for decline including sepsis, hypotension
   and hypernatremia on top of underlying dementia.
   Given her metabolic process, pt is at  high risk for fatiguing and
   being increasingly unable to compensate adequately for metabolic
   acidosis.  Given her agitation she is not a good candidate for NPPV.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities who presented with septic shock, profound dehydration, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hypotension, and acute kidney injury. She has been treated with aggressive IV fluids, pressors, and antibiotics. The patient's condition has been improving, with normalization of lactate levels and decreasing creatinine. However, she remains critically ill with ongoing hypotension and hypothermia, necessitating the restart of levophed. The patient's sodium levels are improving, and she is repleting free water deficit. Acute renal failure is multifactorial in etiology, including pre-renal causes, ongoing medications, low flow state, sepsis, and possible ATN. Troponin T levels are trending down, suggesting improvement in myocardial ischemia. A new CPK elevation raises concern for rhabdomyolysis. The patient's abdominal aortic aneurysm appears larger, but without evidence of dissection or bleed. The patient's baseline mental status is unclear, but it is likely due to underlying dementia exacerbated by sepsis, hypotension, and hypernatremia. The patient is DNR/DNI, and the plan is to continue aggressive care while keeping the family updated on the goals of care. Social work consult has been requested."

   ECHO this morning
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - consider cipro for GNR coverage in case of UTI
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Follow up pm sodium
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which is slowing down. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis improving.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status
   - discuss with family re NGT feeds.
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   - f/u palliative care recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.
   Will talk to family re NGT.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87-year-old female who presented with septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure. She has a history of sepsis caused by coag-negative staphylococci, likely from an unknown source. She is currently being treated with IV fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics. Her electrolyte imbalances and renal insufficiency are being managed, and her metabolic acidosis is improving. She also has anemia, elevated troponin levels, and an enlarged abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Her mental status is declining due to underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection. The patient's goals of care include discussing palliative care recommendations and considering long-term feeding options. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Septic shock: The patient's condition can worsen if the source of infection is not identified and treated effectively.
2. Hypernatremia: There is a risk of further electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient may experience worsening kidney function and fluid overload.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient may develop further complications related to the accumulation of acids in the body.
5. Anemia: The patient's red blood cell count may continue to decrease, leading to fatigue and other symptoms.

   Imaging:
   CXR from today: my read: bibasilar opacity consistent with pleural
   effusion, wedge-shaped consolidation in the right middle lobe?
   ECHO this morning
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to not be able to fully compensate at a
   respiratory standpoint at present with additional non-gap process.
   Should she appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will
   need to consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed without moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 151**]
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 87-year-old female with a chief complaint of septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

2. The patient presented with septic shock, likely caused by coag-negative staph bacteremia from an unknown source. Cultures are still pending.

3. The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, and the most likely etiology is hypovolemic. Sodium correction is being done at a rate of 0.5 mEq/hour.

4. The patient has acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency, which is improving with IV fluid administration. The etiology includes pre-renal and acute tubular necrosis due to severe volume depletion.

5. The patient has metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 10, down from 13 yesterday. The etiology includes acute renal failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis.

6. The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit level of 30.4. Recent baseline Hct values during admission range from 26-29.

7. The patient's troponin levels are trending down, most likely secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.

8. The patient has an enlarged abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 7 cm"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock
   , hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsisNeedham
   blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is satting well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc and cefepime
   - discontinue azithromycin as pt does not seem to have lung infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Follow lactate
   -  Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - consider ECHO to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improving with IVF. The most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. She continues to have free water deficit of 3.3 liter
   today.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to be fully respiratorily compensated at present
   without any additional non-gap or respiratory process. Should she
   appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will need to
   consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed withoug moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting
   of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure. She has a history of sepsis caused by coag-negative Staphylococcus, possibly from a urinary or pulmonary source. The patient's condition is improving with IV fluids, but she remains on vasopressor support. She also has hypernatremia due to hypovolemia, which is being corrected with D5W. Her renal function is improving, but she has a history of chronic renal insufficiency. Metabolic acidosis is multifactorial and improving with treatment of underlying causes. Anemia is stable, and elevated troponin levels are likely due to demand ischemia. The patient has an enlarged abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and elevated CK levels, possibly due to immobility. Mental status changes are attributed to multiple factors including hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection. The patient's goals of care include discussion with the family regarding her condition and prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis caused by coag-negative Staphylococcus. There is a possibility of developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function if appropriate measures are"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to not be able to fully compensate at a
   respiratory standpoint at present with additional non-gap process.
   Should she appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will
   need to consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed without moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .

   - update family and discuss with daughter

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes a baseline creatinine of 1.5, which suggests chronic kidney disease. Her current laboratory results show an elevated blood glucose level of 147 mg/dL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, and an elevated troponin level of 0.44, indicating possible myocardial injury.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/55 mmHg to 147/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her temperature is within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur radiating to the carotid artery, soft diastolic murmur, and no rubs or gallops. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and bowel sounds are present. She has a small amount of urine in the collection bag.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including an enlarged abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 7 cm, elevated CK levels, and mental status changes. Her mental status is described as deteriorating over the"

   Follow pulses and serial hcts.  Clarify baseline MS, though at this

   Follow up official cxr read, as appears more wet, but given recent

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including MMM (multi-morbidity and multi-drug), who presented with septic shock, hypernatremia, and altered mental status on underlying dementia. She had profound dehydration at presentation, ongoing lasix use, and poor oral intake. The patient is currently off pressors, with improving renal function and blood pH. She has a central nervous system (CNS) bacteremia with OSH Bl cxs growing two different species. She still has small to moderate diarrhea with negative Clostridium difficile (C. diff) tests. The source of infection is still unclear. The patient also has pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and suspected sepsis-induced coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis-induced hypotension and shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which has since resolved.
2. Dehydration: The patient had profound dehydration at presentation, which may have contributed to the development of hypernatremia.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient initially had acute renal failure on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRI), which has improved.
4. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/demand ischemia: The patient had elevated troponin levels on admission, indicating potential cardiac involvement.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status due to underlying dementia and possibly seps"

   IMAGING:
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No discrete
   vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is
   seen (does not exclude). Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on
   transthoracic echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

   CXR from today: my read:
   .
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - consider cipro for GNR coverage in case of UTI
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Follow up pm sodium
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which is slowing down. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis improving.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status
   - discuss with family re NGT feeds.
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   - f/u palliative care recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.
   Will talk to family re NGT.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**], an 87-year-old female, is currently in the ICU with septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure. She was diagnosed with sepsis due to coag-negative staphylococcus bacteremia. She is being treated with IVF boluses to maintain urine output and continue vanc, cefepime, and flagyl. Her hypernatremia has resolved, but she still has acute on chronic renal insufficiency. Her metabolic acidosis is multifactorial and improving. She also has anemia with a stable Hct of 30.4. Her troponin levels are trending down, and she has been on ASA 325 mg. She has an enlarged abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) of 7 cm. Her elevated CK is non-cardiac in origin. Her mental status has declined due to underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection. The goals of care include discussing with the family, considering long-term feeding options, and updating palliative care recommendations. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Failure to thrive: The patient's poor oral intake and underlying conditions may contribute to further weight loss and nutritional deficiencies.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency may worsen, leading to further deterioration in kidney function.
3. Infection: Despite being on appropriate"

   IMAGING:
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No discrete
   vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is
   seen (does not exclude). Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on
   transthoracic echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   .
   CXR from today: my read: essentially unchanged from yesterday.
   .
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Resolved.  Afebrile, non-hypothermic. Pt is off
   pressor, and she is hemodynamically stable. [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from
   [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**] pansensitive,
 resistant
   to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear where the source is for
   this bacteremia. The cultures here still pending. Urinary source is
   possible, but usually UTI is not due to staph.  Pulmonary source are
   also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on NC oxygen supplementation, and
   CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella negative.  Echo showed no evidence
   of endocarditis.
   - Switch abx to levaquin 250mg qd PO for plan of 5 day course
   - send another c. diff test, currently c. diff neg x 2
   - d/c femoral CVL
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - Continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which has resolved. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis resolved.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: most likely secondary to demand ischemia in the
   setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Meet with family concerning hospice care and goals of care
   - Continue to check peripheral pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.  Family doesn
t want NGT placed.
   - NPO, family does not want NGT.
   -  Ice chips and mouth care
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status

   - Update family and discuss with daughter
   - F/u palliative care recs

   IMAGING:
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No discrete
   vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is
   seen (does not exclude). Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on
   transthoracic echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - consider cipro for GNR coverage in case of UTI
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Follow up pm sodium
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which is slowing down. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis improving.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status
   - discuss with family re NGT feeds.
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   - f/u palliative care recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.
   Will talk to family re NGT.
   Glycemic Control:  Insulin sliding scale as needed

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**], an 87-year-old female, is currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure. She has a history of sepsis with coag-negative staph bacteremia, likely originating from an unknown source. Her current treatment includes vasopressor support, IV fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She also has mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Other medical issues include hypernatremia, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, metabolic acidosis, anemia, elevated troponin levels, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and elevated CK levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock due to coag-negative staph bacteremia. There is an ongoing search for the source of infection, but it remains unclear. Continuous monitoring and aggressive management of her sepsis are crucial to prevent further complications.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This condition has resolved, but it needs to be monitored closely to prevent its recurrence.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has acute renal failure on top of her chronic renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of her renal function and ongoing hydration are necessary to"
