","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male in the ICU with multiple medical complications. They have a history of adverse drug reactions and chest pain. The patient is experiencing impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, and impaired renal function. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are on multiple medications and have been receiving IV fluids and antibiotics. They are also on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and have abnormal lab results, including elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of infection or delayed wound healing.
2. Adverse Drug Reactions: The patient has a history of adverse drug reactions, including rashes, wheezing, and hives in response to certain medications. This increases the risk of similar reactions occurring with future medication administration.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other heart-related complications.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is an elevated white blood cell count. This may indicate an infection or inflammation in the body.
5. Impaired Renal Function: The patient has impaired renal function, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. This can increase the risk of fluid and electrolyte"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 7175**] is a 67 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation
   on coumadin, CAD, HTN, prior CVA ([**10-17**]), asthma, DM2 who awoke with
   acute onset of stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath this AM
   found to be in AF with [**Month/Year (2) **] now s/p cardioversion with new hypotension
   this morning.
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Exact etiology not entirely clear and likely
   multifactorial in the setting of a. fib with [**Month/Year (2) **], meds, diuresis and
   possible underlying infection (Ucx from admission showed 1000
   enterococcus).  HR remains in the 120s where it has been throughout
   (even faster previously) and she had maintained BPs until this morning
   which suggests it is less likely her rate causing the acute drop in
   BP.  She was amio loaded yesterday and received multiple x1 doses of
   metoprolol so med effect on BP certainly possible.  Additionally, she
   was febrile on presentation to the ED and initial UCx showed
   enterococcus (only 1000 colonies at that time, however) so infection is
   certainly a possibility.  CXR today does show increase in LLL and right
   middle lobe opacification concerning for pneumonia; ? aspiration during
   cardioversion.  She does also have new leukocytosis which is somewhat
   difficult to interpret as it started after prednisone dose.  Does seem
   higher bump than would expect from 1 time steroid dose alone so
   infection may be contributing.  She does also have diffuse abdominal
   pain >RUQ which she says is chronic, but is certainly notable on exam
   making intraabdominal infection possible.  LFTs, however are normal
   making cholecystitis or ascending cholangitis less likely.  No e/o
   acute blood loss.
   - Continue levofloxacin for possible pneumonia; will add vanco as well
   pending repeat UA/UCx given enterococcus on initial UCx
   - check hct now
   - add on lipase
   - Monitor abdominal exam
   - Consider further imaging with CT abdomen/pelvis if change in
   abdominal exam
   - Trend lactate
   .
   #. Fever: T to 101.5 in the ED with low grade temps on the floor. No
   clear source of infection as she has no localizing symptoms beyond
   abdominal discomfort that she reports is chronic.  LFTs normal.  CXR
   without infiltrate and she is without cough.  UA from presentation was
   negative, but culture did grow 1000 enterococcus (? contaminant or
   early infection).  Blood cultures to date have shown no growth.
   - Follow up micro data
   - f/u final read of repeat CXR
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  WBC count was normal on presentation.  She received a
   x1 of prednisone on [**12-3**] with subsequent rise in WBC count.  ? steroid
   related or in the setting of infection.  Does have 90% neutrophilia, no
   bands.
   - infection w/u as above
   .
   #. Rhythm: Long standing history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin.
   INR currently supratherapeutic at 3.1 likely in the setting of
   antibiotics.  Because she has maintained her BPs even when HR was
   faster than at present, her a.fib seems unlikely to be causing her
   hypotension currently.  The medications that she is receiving for rate
   control, however, may be causing/contributing to her hypotension.
   - Hold coumadin today, follow INR
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue beta [**Month/Year (2) 368**], titrate up as tolerated
   - Consider repeat cardioversion if further HD compromise
   .
   #. CAD: Had chest pain this AM however occurred in setting of AF with
   [**Month/Year (2) **]. No history of stress test in our records. Reported CAD on medical
   history but unclear details.  CEs showed positive trop with peak 0.14
   now 0.10 and likely demand in the setting of [**Month/Year (2) **] vs. post
   cardioversion.  EKG largely unchanged from prior although does show
   some slightly more pronounced STD laterally with rate of 104.
   - Continue beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 369**]
   .
   #. Pump: EF normal in [**2102**] however now with elevated BNP and crackles
   at right base following 1.5L IVF in ED.  Also with new O2 requirement
   and e/o pulmonary edema on CXR [**12-3**], now improved on CXR today.  Just
   received additional IVFs on the floor for hypotension (2L).
   - Monitor volume status
   - Hold on diuresis given hypotension
   - Should have nonurgent repeat TTE
   .
   # Stage 2 decub ulcer:
   .
   #. DM2:
   - Insulin sliding scale
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   # Hypertension: Actually hypotensive on the floor, but now SBPs
   improved to low 100s currently.  Given a. fib with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue
   her metoprolol for now.
   - Continue metoprolol
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes on exam.
   - Continue advair
   .
   # s/p CVA:  No active issues.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  TSH 4 on admission.
   - Continue levoxyl
   .
   #. FEN: Follow and replete electrolytes. Cardiac diabetic diet.
   .
   #. Access: PIV.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, prior cerebrovascular accident, asthma, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with acute onset of stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation and underwent cardioversion. Post-cardioversion, she experienced new hypotension. The exact etiology of her hypotension is unclear and is likely multifactorial, considering her pre-existing conditions, medications, diuresis, and possible underlying infection (enterococcus from admission). Other findings include fever, leukocytosis, and diffuse abdominal pain. Chest X-ray showed increased opacification in the left lower lobe and right middle lobe, concerning for pneumonia. The patient's condition is being managed with antibiotics, monitoring of vital signs, and further investigations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to various factors such as medication effects, infection, or a combination of these. It is important to monitor her closely and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Fever: The patient has had episodes of fever, which may indicate an underlying infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate treatment.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count could be a response to infection or steroid use. Monitoring the trend and investigating for"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 7175**] is a 67 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation
   on coumadin, CAD, HTN, prior CVA ([**10-17**]), asthma, DM2 who awoke with
   acute onset of stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath this AM
   found to be in AF with [**Month/Year (2) **] now s/p cardioversion with new hypotension
   this morning.
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Exact etiology not entirely clear and likely
   multifactorial in the setting of a. fib with [**Month/Year (2) **], meds, diuresis and
   possible underlying infection (Ucx from admission showed 1000
   enterococcus).  HR remains in the 120s where it has been throughout
   (even faster previously) and she had maintained BPs until this morning
   which suggests it is less likely her rate causing the acute drop in
   BP.  She was amio loaded yesterday and received multiple x1 doses of
   metoprolol so med effect on BP certainly possible.  Additionally, she
   was febrile on presentation to the ED and initial UCx showed
   enterococcus (only 1000 colonies at that time, however) so infection is
   certainly a possibility.  CXR today does show increase in LLL and right
   middle lobe opacification concerning for pneumonia; ? aspiration during
   cardioversion.  She does also have new leukocytosis which is somewhat
   difficult to interpret as it started after prednisone dose.  Does seem
   higher bump than would expect from 1 time steroid dose alone so
   infection may be contributing.  She does also have diffuse abdominal
   pain >RUQ which she says is chronic, but is certainly notable on exam
   making intraabdominal infection possible.  LFTs, however are normal
   making cholecystitis or ascending cholangitis less likely.  No e/o
   acute blood loss.
   - Continue levofloxacin for possible pneumonia; will add vanco as well
   pending repeat UA/UCx given enterococcus on initial UCx
   - check hct now
   - add on lipase
   - Monitor abdominal exam
   - Consider further imaging with CT abdomen/pelvis if change in
   abdominal exam
   - Trend lactate
   .
   #. Fever: T to 101.5 in the ED with low grade temps on the floor. No
   clear source of infection as she has no localizing symptoms beyond
   abdominal discomfort that she reports is chronic.  LFTs normal.  CXR
   without infiltrate and she is without cough.  UA from presentation was
   negative, but culture did grow 1000 enterococcus (? contaminant or
   early infection).  Blood cultures to date have shown no growth.
   - Follow up micro data
   - f/u final read of repeat CXR
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  WBC count was normal on presentation.  She received a
   x1 of prednisone on [**12-3**] with subsequent rise in WBC count.  ? steroid
   related or in the setting of infection.  Does have 90% neutrophilia, no
   bands.
   - infection w/u as above
   .
   #. Rhythm: Long standing history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin.
   INR currently supratherapeutic at 3.1 likely in the setting of
   antibiotics.  Because she has maintained her BPs even when HR was
   faster than at present, her a.fib seems unlikely to be causing her
   hypotension currently.  The medications that she is receiving for rate
   control, however, may be causing/contributing to her hypotension.
   - Hold coumadin today, follow INR
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue beta [**Month/Year (2) 368**], titrate up as tolerated
   - Consider repeat cardioversion if further HD compromise
   .
   #. CAD: Had chest pain this AM however occurred in setting of AF with
   [**Month/Year (2) **]. No history of stress test in our records. Reported CAD on medical
   history but unclear details.  CEs showed positive trop with peak 0.14
   now 0.10 and likely demand in the setting of [**Month/Year (2) **] vs. post
   cardioversion.  EKG largely unchanged from prior although does show
   some slightly more pronounced STD laterally with rate of 104.
   - Continue beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 369**]
   .
   #. Pump: EF normal in [**2102**] however now with elevated BNP and crackles
   at right base following 1.5L IVF in ED.  Also with new O2 requirement
   and e/o pulmonary edema on CXR [**12-3**], now improved on CXR today.  Just
   received additional IVFs on the floor for hypotension (2L).
   - Monitor volume status
   - Hold on diuresis given hypotension
   - Should have nonurgent repeat TTE
   .
   # Stage 2 decub ulcer:
   .
   #. DM2:
   - Insulin sliding scale
   - Diabetic diet

   # Hypertension: Actually hypotensive on the floor, but now SBPs

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, previous cerebrovascular accident, asthma, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with acute onset of stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath, which led to cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. She is currently experiencing hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, possible pneumonia, and diffuse abdominal pain. Her medical history includes chronic RUQ discomfort, positive troponin levels indicating possible CAD, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), crackles at the right base, and pulmonary edema. She also has a stage 2 decubitus ulcer, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension (although currently hypotensive), asthma, hypothyroidism, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The exact etiology of the hypotension is not entirely clear and likely multifactorial, involving atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, medications, diuresis, and possible underlying infection.
2. Infection: The patient has fever, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, positive enterococcus culture, and signs of pneumonia on chest X-ray. This suggests a possible infection, which needs further investigation.
3. Pneumonia: The chest X-ray indicates increased opacification in the left lower lobe and right middle lobe, concerning for pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, prior cerebrovascular accident, asthma, and type 2 diabetes. She presented with acute onset of stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation. She underwent cardioversion and was subsequently hypotensive. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, anemia, leukocytosis, and chest discomfort. Her cardiac ejection fraction has decreased from normal to 40-45%, and she has a stage 2 decub ulcer. She also has hypothyroidism, and her blood glucose levels need to be managed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable in the ICU but still in the 100s-120s. It is likely multifactorial due to infection, medications for atrial fibrillation, and diuresis on the floor. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate fluid management will be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has new infiltrates on chest X-ray and a fever, suggesting ongoing infection. Levofloxacin will be continued for an additional 5 days. Monitoring for improvement in respiratory symptoms and following up with microbiological data is important.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a long-standing history of atrial fibrillation and was recently cardioverted. Restarting low-dose coumadin should be"

   acute onset of stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath this AM
   found to be in AF with RVR now s/p cardioversion with persistent
   difficulty with rate control.

   #. Hypotension:  SBPs stable in the ICU in the 100s-120s.  Likely
   multifactorial in setting of infection, meds for a.fib, s/p diuresis on

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypothyroidism. The patient presented with acute onset of stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and underwent cardioversion.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable in the ICU but has been fluctuating, ranging from 104/59 mmHg to 128/63 mmHg. This could be due to infection, medications for atrial fibrillation, and diuresis.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has new infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. She is currently receiving levofloxacin for treatment.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count was initially normal but rose after receiving prednisone. It is unclear whether this is due to steroid-related effects or infection. The WBC count improved today.

4. Anemia: The patient has developed anemia, possibly due to hemodilution from intravenous fluids upon transfer to the ICU. Further evaluation is needed.

The patient presented with acute onset of stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath this morning, found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She underwent cardioversion with persistent difficulty in rate control.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 134 bpm, blood pressure of 104/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and temperature of 35.7°C.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, pneumonia, leukocytosis, anemia, and impaired skin integrity. The pneumonia is suspected to be community-acquired and is being treated with levofloxacin for a total of 5 days. The leukocytosis is likely due to steroid use or infection, and the patient's WBC count has improved today. The anemia is thought to be caused by hemodilution from intravenous fluids upon transfer to the ICU. Impaired skin integrity is mentioned but no further details are provided.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 7175**] is a 67 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation
   on coumadin, CAD, HTN, prior CVA ([**10-17**]), asthma, DM2 who awoke with
   acute onset of stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath this AM
   found to be in AF with [**Month/Year (2) **] now s/p cardioversion with persistent
   difficulty with rate control.
   .
   #. Hypotension:  SBPs stable in the ICU in the 100s-120s.  Likely
   multifactorial in setting of infection, meds for a.fib, s/p diuresis on
   the floor.  Received 2L prior to tx to ICU and additional 1L overnight
   with stability in BP.  Has chronic abdominal discomfort, but nonfocal
   exam and normal LFTs and lipase.
   - Continue levofloxacin for pneumonia
   - Monitor abdominal exam
   .
   # Pneumonia:  New infiltrates on CXR from [**12-5**].   Admission CXR did
   not show e/o infiltrate, but she was already febrile on presentation
   with new O2 requirement so suspect pneumonia was already brewing as
   opposed to post cardioversion/aspiration.
   - Levofloxacin; will continue for total 5 days
   - prn nebs
   - Incentive spirometry
   -f/u culture data
   .
   #. Fever:  Has been afebrile in the ICU.   T to 101.5 in the ED with
   low grade temps on the floor.   Appears to be in the setting of
   pneumonia with new infiltrates on CXR yesterday.  UA from presentation
   was negative, but culture did grow 1000 enterococcus with repeat UA
   yesterday overall unremarkable.  Blood cultures to date have shown no
   growth.
   - Follow up micro data
   - continue Levofloxacin for pneumonia
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  WBC count was normal on presentation.  She received a
   x1 of prednisone on [**12-3**] with subsequent rise in WBC count.  ? steroid
   related or in the setting of infection.  Does have 90% neutrophilia, no
   bands.  WBC count improved today.
   - Levofloxacin for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum culture (has been thus far unable to produce
   sputum cx)
   .
   # Anemia:  From normal baseline.  Suspect in part d/t hemodilution from
   IVFs upon tx to ICU.  No e/o bleeding.
   - pm hct
   .
   #. Rhythm: Long standing history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin.
   Echo with large atria so seems unlikely to maintain sinus rhythm if
   cardioverted.  Also, underlying pneumonia likely driving a.fib with
   [**Month/Year (2) **].  INR down to 2.9 from 3.1.  Because she has maintained her BPs
   even when HR was faster than at present, her a.fib seems unlikely to be
   causing her presenting hypotension.
   - continue low dose coumadin given now on amiodorone and Levofloxacin
   both of which will interact; follow coags
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - tolerating beta-[**Month/Year (2) 368**], but w/o improvement in HR.  Consider further
   uptitration of metoprolol vs. digoxin vs. diltiazem desensitization,
   question cardioversion
   - Treating underlying pneumonia
   .
   #. CAD: Had chest pain on presentation however occurred in setting of
   AF with [**Month/Year (2) **]. No history of stress test in our records. Reported CAD on
   medical history but unclear details.  CEs showed positive trop with
   peak 0.14 now 0.10 and likely demand in the setting of [**Month/Year (2) **] vs. post
   cardioversion.  EKG largely unchanged from prior although does show
   some slightly more pronounced STD laterally with rate of 104.
   - Continue beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 369**]
   - Checking lipid panel
   .
   #. Pump: EF normal in [**2102**] with repeat echo yesterday showing LVEF
   40-45%.  TTE also showed dilated atria.
   - Monitor volume status
   - Hold on diuresis for now given recent hypotension
   .
   # Chest discomfort:  Pleuritic in nature and likely multifactorial in
   setting of pneumonia and also cardioversion.
   - continue acetaminophen prn
   .
   # Stage 2 decub ulcer:  ? decub vs. trauma from bed pain.
   - daily wound care
   .
   #. DM2:
   - Insulin sliding scale
   - Diabetic diet

   # Hypertension: Actually hypotensive on the floor, but now SBPs stable
   in the 100s-120s.  Given a. fib with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue her metoprolol
   for now.
   - Continue metoprolol

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, prior cerebrovascular accident, asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, who presented with acute onset of stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation and underwent cardioversion but continues to have difficulty with rate control. The patient also has pneumonia, leukocytosis, anemia, hypotension, chest discomfort, a stage 2 decub ulcer, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, asthma, hypothyroidism, and requires repletion of electrolytes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable in the ICU, ranging from 100s-120s. This could be multifactorial, considering the infection, medications for atrial fibrillation, and recent diuresis on the floor. 
2. Pneumonia: The patient has new infiltrates on the chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia. This will need to be treated with appropriate antibiotics, such as levofloxacin, and supportive care.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is long-standing and on coumadin. It seems unlikely to maintain sinus rhythm if cardioverted, and underlying pneumonia may be driving the atrial fibrillation. 
4. Chest pain: The patient had chest pain on presentation, likely occurring in the setting of"

The patient's AFib w/RVR has persisted despite an increase in amiodarone dosage. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has developed a new rash on the right forearm. The patient has a history of allergies to multiple medications including Bactrim, tetracyclines, erythromycin base, and Optiray 350. The patient's current medications include levofloxacin, amiodarone, metoprolol, sertraline, levothyroxine, aspirin, Advair, insulin, lactulose, and acyclovir. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dyspnea and a rash. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 99/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient has been receiving IV fluids, oxygen therapy, and medications for various conditions including pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, and sacral ulcer. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated troponin T levels, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently hemodynamically stable. They have a history of allergies to multiple medications, including amiodarone, which is currently being increased to 400 mg three times a day per cardiology orders. The patient also has a new rash on their right forearm, which could be due to phlebitis or a drug allergy.

Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis/hypotension: The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, likely due to pneumonia. Hypotension could be caused by infection (sepsis) or AFib.
2. AFib with RVR: The patient's AFib with RVR has improved slightly with increased amiodarone. They will continue to be monitored, and metoprolol will be continued. The patient is NPO for possible cardioversion today.
3. CAD: The patient's CP on admission improved, likely due to AFib with RVR. Troponin levels peaked at 0.14 and have now normalized at 0.01.
4. Pump: The patient's EF is 40-45% by echo. They will be monitored for volume status, and Lasix may be restarted when stable.
5. Rash on back: The patient has a possible herpes zoster infection."

   Hypotension in the setting of RVR. On day three of levofloxacin. Would
   add vancomycin for additional coverage of hospital acquired flora and
   for possible staph/strep infection on back. RVR treated with nodal
   agents, doubt ability to get perfect control inthe setting of acute
   infection. Would tolerate HR in ~ 110. Appreciate cardiology input.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation (afib), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). She presented with afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is now on amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg three times a day. The patient has allergies to Bactrim, tetracyclines, erythromycin base, Optiray 350, bee sting kit, citrus-derived agents, fish product derivatives, shellfish-derived agents, and iodine-containing agents. She has been receiving vancomycin since 9:06 AM. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/92 mmHg to 124/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and she is on nasal cannula oxygen support. Her weight is currently 86 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,130 mL and total output of 875 mL. The patient's blood products and urine output are also noted. She is receiving respiratory support and her ABG results are available. Physical examination findings include dullness on percussion at the right base, bronchial breath sounds at the left base, a soft and non-tender abdomen, and scattered pustules on her back. Neurologic examination reveals that she is attentive and follows simple commands. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine level. Troponin-T is within normal range. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are also provided. The patient's assessment includes acute bronchitis and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with the need for additional coverage of hospital-acquired flora and possible staph/strep infection on her back. The plan involves adding vancomycin for its coverage. The patient's rapid ventricular response is being treated with nodal agents, but it may not be possible to achieve perfect control in the setting of an acute infection. The patient's heart rate is being tolerated at approximately 110 bpm, and cardiology input is appreciated. Further plans are per resident note, and the patient can be transferred to the cardiology service today. ICU care includes nutrition via PO diet, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is transfer to the floor - Cardiology service.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Bronchitis: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute bronchitis, including bronchial breath sounds at the left base and a productive cough. Complications such"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old woman with known afib presents with HAP and afib with RVR.
   Hypotension in the setting of RVR. On day three of levofloxacin. Would
   add vancomycin for additional coverage of hospial acquired flora and
   for possible staph/strep infection on back. RVR treated with nodal
   agents, doubt ability to get perfect control inthe setting of acute
   infection. Would tolerate HR in ~ 110. Apreciate cardiology input.
   Further plans as per resident note. Can transfer to cardiology service
   today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation (afib), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension. She is currently in the ICU and has been on amiodarone, with plans to add vancomycin for additional coverage of hospital-acquired flora and possible staph/strep infection on her back. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/92 to 124/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius. She is receiving nasal cannula oxygen support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, which may be related to her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. This could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage if not promptly addressed.

2. Hospital-acquired infection: The patient has been diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and has pustules on her back that may indicate a possible staph/strep infection. The addition of vancomycin is aimed at covering hospital-acquired flora and treating the suspected infection.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's atrial fibrillation"
