   Assessment and Plan
   71F OSA, pHTN, DHF, chronic low back pain, presents with worsened low
   back pain and acute on chronic respiratory failure
    //Acute on chronic respiratory failure
   -Suspect that pt is borderline compensated at baseline
 has evidence
   of chronic CO2 retention likely due to obesity hypoventilation, pHTN,
   OSA, dCHF.  Of note, pt has gained considerable weight over the past
   few months, likely related to increased salt and po intake and volume
   overload.
   -Acute decompensation could be caused by a number of factors alone or
   in combination; continued chronic decompensation reaching point of
   acute decompensation, pulmonary edema related to myocardial ischemia or
   previous silent infarct, infection (though WBC nl, no fevers, no
   productive cough)
   -Benefited from mask ventilation overnight - doing much better today
   able to avert intubation
   -Diuresing
   -spiked overnight, apparent new lt infiltrate on film.  Treat for CAP
   empirically pending cx data guidance
   -repeat ABG
   -send SCx/GS if produces
   //Low back pain
   -appears to be her chronic low back pain
   -known compression fx, no new fx noted on films this admission
   -avoid narcotics
    //  Acute on Chronic renal failure:
    - likely [**2-7**] volume overload (cr got wose in setting of holding lasix)
    - cont diuresis

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and chronic heart failure (CHF). She presents with worsened low back pain, acute on chronic respiratory failure, hypertension, and suspected chronic CO2 retention. 

The patient's history includes allergies to streptomycin, versed, fentanyl, and cardiac arrest. She has been on various medications such as ceftriaxone, naloxone, diltiazem, and furosemide.

Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.4 C (101.2 F), blood pressure ranging from 148/70 mmHg to 92/45 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

Her physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds with prolonged expiration, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and attentive behavior with normal mental status.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function with increased creatinine levels.

The patient's respiratory support includes non-invasive ventilation, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, FiO2 of 35%, and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 72 mmHg, PaO2 of 120 mmHg, and Ve of"

   obstructive sleep apnea, and AF who was admitted for management of
   acute on chronic lower back pain and is transferred to the MICU for
   somnolence and hypercapneic respiratory failure.
   # Acute on chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Patient has OSA
   at baseline, patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 984**], and was on cpap at home but did
   not use prior to arrival.  Possibly component of non-use of CPAP vs
   volume overload, vs sedating medications (gabapentin).  Improved ABG
   with CPAP, though last night did not use it the whole night due to
   discomfort
   - d/w respiratory if can use nasal mask vs pillows
   - PO diuresis now
   - avoid sedating medications
   - outpatient f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 984**] (has not been seen since [**2133**])
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney injury:  baseline creatinine of ~1.4 with
   rise in setting of not receiving lasix and pulm edema on cxr.  FeUrea
   28% but appears clinically overloaded.
   - lasix for I/0 goal -500 cc
   - renally dose meds
   - recheck CHM 7/creatinine
   .
   # dCHF:  has pulm edema, likely in setting of not receiving lasix.
   - lasix for I/O goal -500 cc to 1L
   - consider recheck ECHO if no improvement with diuresis
   .

","The patient is a 71-year-old woman with obesity, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted for acute on chronic lower back pain and transferred to the MICU for somnolence and hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, acute on chronic kidney injury, decompensated congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to non-compliance with CPAP use or volume overload, further decline in renal function, worsening congestive heart failure symptoms if diuresis is not effective, and potential thromboembolic events due to atrial fibrillation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, renal function, heart failure symptoms, and anticoagulation therapy. Additionally, outpatient follow-up with the primary care physician is recommended for ongoing management of her chronic conditions."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with obesity, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic kidney disease, decompensated congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted for acute on chronic lower back pain and transferred to the MICU for somnolence and hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of using CPAP at home but did not use it prior to arrival. She was found to have an irregularly irregular heart rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient's use of CPAP at home but not prior to arrival may be a contributing factor to her respiratory failure. The discomfort with the pillows may require switching to a nasal mask. Additionally, volume overload and sedating medications could also contribute to the respiratory failure.
2. Acute on chronic kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level is approximately 1.4, which is currently stable. Diuretics (Lasix) have been initiated for I/O goal -500 cc and renal dosing of medications will be considered.
3. dCHF (decompensated congestive heart failure): The patient exhibits signs of pulmonary edema, likely due to not receiving Lasix. Diuretics (Lasix) have been ordered for I/O goal -500 cc to 1L, and outpatient metop"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged individual with multiple medical conditions including obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), decompensated heart failure (dCHF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

The patient presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and altered mental status. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently receiving mechanical ventilation support through a nasal cannula. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, hypotension with a blood pressure of 102/58 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. The patient is also experiencing hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation level of 96%. 

The patient has a history of allergies to streptomycin, Versed (midazolam), fentanyl, and cardiac arrest. They have been receiving antibiotics (ceftriaxone and levofloxacin) and other medications such as furosemide and dextrose. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), and troponin-T. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances with low potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++), as well as elevated levels"
