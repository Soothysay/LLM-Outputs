","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute shortness of breath. The patient's medical history includes chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. Upon presentation, the patient was found to be volume overloaded, as confirmed by chest X-ray and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of >16,000. The patient was initially treated with escalating doses of lasix but required diuril/lasix to achieve a urine output of 2L. The patient continues to receive bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support, which has improved oxygen saturation levels. However, the patient remains restless and required 1mg of morphine IV three times due to confusion overnight. The patient also experienced hematuria, likely secondary to trauma from a foley catheter in the setting of heparin gtt.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4C (97.6F), heart rate of 101 bpm with atrial flutter, blood pressure ranging from 100/65 to 131/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,174 mL and output of 1,625 mL since 12 AM.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, acute on chronic aspiration pneumonitis, and possible pneumonia. He presented with acute shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded, confirmed by chest X-ray and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of >16,000. The patient is currently receiving diuretics (diuril/lasix), bipap support, and morphine as needed for respiratory distress. He also has a history of GERD, hypertension, and Charcot disease. The patient's recent lab results show elevated troponin T levels and evidence of kidney dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure has been exacerbated by acute events, leading to respiratory distress and fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance and ongoing diuretic therapy will be necessary to manage this condition.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's acute on chronic aspiration pneumonitis may progress to pneumonia, especially considering his baseline risk factors. Antibiotic therapy, such as levofloxacin, should be continued, and sputum cultures should be obtained for appropriate identification and treatment of any bacterial pathogens.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's recent episode of atrial fibrillation should be managed with beta-blockers (metoprolol) to control the heart rate and prevent further arrhythmia episodes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of GERD, hypertension, and Charcot disease. He presented with acute respiratory distress, which was initially thought to be due to volume overload. The patient was given diuretics and put on BiPAP, resulting in improved oxygen saturation levels. However, he remained restless and required morphine IV three times. The patient also experienced hematuria, likely secondary to trauma from the foley catheter in the setting of heparin gtt.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 101 bpm with atrial flutter, blood pressure ranging from 100/65 mmHg to 131/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events.

The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and increased Cr levels. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, while other lab values such as glucose and TCO2 are also within normal limits. The PT/PTT/INR levels are slightly elevated, indicating a potential bleeding risk.

The patient's assessment and plan include heart failure (CHF), chronic and acute, risk for injury, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and pneumonia (PNA). The patient has evidence of acute"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, hypertension, and Charcot tooth disease. He presents with worsening shortness of breath and wheezing for a few weeks, associated with severe GERD symptoms and cough. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and an EF of 30%. He is currently experiencing acute episodes of shortness of breath, volume overload with elevated jugular venous distension (JVD), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 16K, and chest X-ray showing edema. The patient is on BiPAP, which has shown poor response to lasix but good response to diuril. He is also on heparin, morphine, and other ICU medications. The patient's condition remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's symptoms of acute shortness of breath, wheezing, and poor response to BiPAP indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Cardiac Arrest: With a history of atrial fibrillation and elevated troponin levels, there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias leading to cardiac arrest. Continuous cardiac monitoring and close observation are required.
3. Infection: The presence of aspiration pneumonia increases the risk of further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, hypertension, and Charcot tooth disease. He presented to the emergency room with worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, severe GERD symptoms, and cough. The CT chest showed esophageal thickening and bronchial wall thickening with bibasilar consolidations, suggestive of recurrent aspiration. The patient also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the ED and a troponin bump on anticoagulation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Chronic: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, which is contributing to his current symptoms.
2. Risk for Injury: The patient is at risk for injury due to his critical condition.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which is associated with his current presentation.
4. Pneumonia, Aspiration: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, as evidenced by the CT chest findings and symptoms. He will be kept NPO until GI evaluated, continue on Levoflox for yellow productive cough, and check sputum culture. Steroids will be discontinued, nebs for comfort, wean O2, and high-dose PPI will be administered. Speech and swallow evaluation, barium swallow, and GI consult for endoscopy will be arranged. Aspiration precautions will be implemented.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of GERD, hypertension, and Charcot tooth disease. He presents with worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, severe GERD symptoms, cough, and evidence of heart failure. The patient has been diagnosed with chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and pneumonia due to aspiration. He also has an EF of 30% and requires therapeutic anticoagulation for NSTEMI. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation, diuretics, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and NSTEMI, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to aspiration pneumonia and heart failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and potential need for more advanced respiratory support.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
4. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by dehydration or nephrotoxic medications.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)"

He presented with respiratory distress and was found to have pulmonary edema on chest X-ray with a BNP level of >16,000. Tracheomalacia is also being considered. The patient was started on Levaquin, Atrovent/Xopenex nebs q6h, diuresis with Diuril/Lasix with a goal of -2L, BiPAP as needed, and morphine PRN. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation episode began during an acute SOB episode in the ED. Dilt gtt was weaned off, and Trops are elevated by CK, likely due to rate and volume overload. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 30%. Cardiology would like to try metoprolol instead of PO dilt, so this was switched today and will need to be titrated up. TSH is 0.94, and the patient has been in and out of sinus rhythm overnight.

The patient has a history of GERD, and it has been managed with 40mg of [**Hospital1 **] and added famotidine. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3827**] is following. A baseline swallow (BAS) is scheduled on Monday.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of GERD, hypertension, Charcot tooth disease, and previous fundoplication. He was admitted with acute on chronic aspiration pneumonitis and possible pneumonia, along with acute on chronic systolic heart failure. The patient presented with respiratory distress, requiring intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and currently on a nasal cannula. He has evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of >16,000.

Impressions and Plan:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has signs of acute on aspiration on CT chest, concern for PNA given consolidation on CT scan. He also has evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR with a BNP of >16,000. Tracheomalacia is being worked up as an outpatient. The patient is on levaquin, atrovent/xopenex nebs q6h, diuresis with diuril/lasix with goal -1.5L, BiPAP as needed, morphine prn, and omeprazole/famotidine.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, likely due to pneumonia and possibly acute coronary syndrome given troponin elevation and focal hypokinesis on ECHO. He is on heparin gtt, which will be transitioned"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of GERD, hypertension, and Charcot tooth disease. He presents with acute on chronic GERD and pneumonia, NSTEMI, pulmonary edema from CHF, aflutter converted to sinus rhythm with cardizem on anticoagulation, and possible tuberculosis (TBM). The patient's current condition shows significant improvement with diuresis and antibiotics. He is using Bipap intermittently.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Heart failure (CHF), systolic, chronic: The patient has chronic heart failure, which is worsening. Diuretics will be continued to manage fluid overload.

2. Risk for injury: The patient is at risk for further injury due to his critical condition.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient had atrial fibrillation, but it was successfully converted to sinus rhythm with the use of cardizem.

4. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has pneumonia likely caused by aspiration. Antibiotics (Levofloxacin) will be continued, and efforts will be made to keep the patient off Bipap to prevent further aspiration.

5. TBM: The patient has a possible diagnosis of tuberculosis (TBM). Further investigations are needed to confirm this.

The plan includes the following interventions:
- Continue diuretics to manage fluid overload.
- Switch from heparin to lovenox.
- Perform a barium swallow to evaluate for GERD"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and previous fundoplication for GERD. He presents with worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, severe GERD symptoms, cough, and new-onset pulmonary edema. The CT chest shows esophageal thickening and bronchial wall thickening with bibasilar consolidations, suggestive of recurrent aspiration. The patient has a low ejection fraction of 30%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of GERD, fundoplication, and severe GERD symptoms suggest an increased risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Chronic heart failure exacerbation: The patient's worsening shortness of breath and pulmonary edema indicate worsening heart failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can contribute to cardiac complications.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's wheezing and hypoxia indicate respiratory distress, which may be due to aspiration, pneumonia, or cardiac-related issues.
5. Pneumonia: The CT chest findings of bronchial wall thickening and bibasilar consolidations suggest the presence of pneumonia.
6. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's low ejection fraction and troponin elevation indicate cardiac dysfunction, possibly related to a recent NSTEMI event.
7. Poor dentition: The patient's poor dent"

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of GERD, hypertension, Charcot tooth disease, acute on chronic aspiration pneumonitis, possible pneumonia, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, and NSTEMI. The patient presented with respiratory distress, which has improved. He has signs of acute on chronic aspiration on CT chest and concern for PNA given consolidation on CT scan. Aspiration is likely secondary to known GERD. He also has evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR with a BNP of >16,000 so CHF is also a contributor. Tracheomalacia is being worked up as an outpatient. The patient initially required intermittent BIPAP but has now been off of BIPAP for >24 hours.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 122/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has received omeprazole (Prilosec) and heparin gtt, which was transitioned to Lovenox. Allergies include no known drug allergies.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 27.7%, platelet count of 173 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.23, total CO2 of 24, and glucose of 59 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination revealed crackles/ronchi throughout both lung fields, mild expiratory wheezing, and bilateral scattered bronchial markings. The patient's abdomen was soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. There were no focal neurologic deficits or extremity edema noted.

The patient's plan includes continuing Levaquin to complete a 7-day course, Atrovent/xopenex nebs q6h, holding diuresis as the patient is dry on exam, diuresing PRN, continuing omeprazole to 40mg [Hospital1] and famotidine at night, performing a CT trachea when stable, and performing a baseline EKG (BAS) today.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include respiratory distress due to aspiration pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of GERD, hypertension, and Charcot tooth disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU with acute-on-chronic aspiration pneumonitis, possible pneumonia, acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure, and respiratory distress. The patient has required intermittent BiPAP overnight and is currently on a nasal cannula. His allergies are unknown, and he has no known drug allergies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has signs of acute-on-aspiration on CT chest, with concern for pneumonia given consolidation on CT scan. He also has evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR with a BNP of >16,000. The patient requires ongoing respiratory support, including BiPAP as needed, and diuresis with diuril/lasix to manage fluid balance.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation likely due to pneumonia and possibly acute coronary syndrome (ACS) given troponin elevation and focal hypokinesis on ECHO. Treatment includes continuation of beta-blockers, statins, aspirin, stopping heparin gtt, and starting lovenox.
3. GERD: The patient has a history of GERD, which may contribute to his aspiration risk. Ongoing management includes 40 mg of omeprazole and added famotidine. Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3827**] is planned.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be monitored while in the house, and lisinopril was previously stopped per Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 7909**] note one month ago.
5. FEN (Feeding): The patient requires no IVF, replete electrolytes, regular cardiac diet, nectar pre-thickened liquids as tolerated with aspiration precautions.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Access: The patient has peripheral lines in place.
8. Code: The patient has a DNR/DNI code status.
9. Disposition: The patient's disposition is pending above.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with the healthcare team for further evaluation and management of the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for acute coronary syndrome and is currently stable. The patient autodiuresed well, with a total output of 800cc by midnight. Heparin was stopped and transitioned to Lovenox. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 122/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and is receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.29, indicating respiratory acidosis. The physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's intubation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating myocardial injury. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for low potassium. The patient has a history of acute coronary syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and disposition is still pending further evaluation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.29, indicating respiratory acidosis. This suggests inadequate ventilation or oxygenation, which could lead to respiratory failure"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of GERD, hypertension, Charcot tooth disease, who presented with acute on chronic GERD and pneumonia, NSTEMI, pulmonary edema from CHF, and possibly tuberculosis of the bones (TBM). The patient has shown significant improvement with diuresis and antibiotics but still has ronchorous chest sounds and needs a dynamic airway CT before discharge to look for TBM. The patient is off bipap and oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and arrhythmias.
2. Injury Risk: The patient is at risk for injury due to impaired mobility, sedation, and the use of restraints.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has been in aflutter and was converted to sinus rhythm with cardizem. He is on full anticoagulation with lovenox, and there may be reversible disease.
4. Pneumonia, Aspiration: The patient has pneumonia and is at risk for further aspiration due to poor dentition, JVD, and polyphonic wheezes and ronchi.
5. Tuberculosis of the Bones (TBM): The patient may have TBM, which can lead to systemic complications if left untreated.
6. Hematuria: The patient developed hematuria"

Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of GERD, hypertension, and Charcot tooth disease. He presented with acute on chronic GERD and pneumonia, NSTEMI, pulmonary edema from CHF, aflutter converted to sinus rhythm with cardizem on anticoagulation, and possible tuberculous meningitis (TBM). The patient has shown significant improvement with diuresis and antibiotics. He is currently off bipap, still very ronchorous from secretions, and needs a dynamic airway CT before discharge to look for TBM. He is off O2.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Heart failure (CHF), systolic, chronic.
2. Risk for injury.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB).
4. Pneumonia, aspiration.
5. Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL.
6. Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Poor dentition, JVD 8 cm improved.
7. Cardiovascular: S1S2 reg, no murmurs.
8. Peripheral Vascular: All present.
9. Respiratory / Chest: Polyphonic wheezes and ronchi, musical chest.
10. Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present.
11. Skin: Warm.
12. Neurologic: AAOx 3.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may lead to fluid accumulation and pulmonary congestion, which can result in worsening shortness of breath and fatigue.
2. Infection: The presence of pneumonia and possible TBM increases the risk of infection, which can lead to fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory symptoms.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Anticoagulation therapy is being provided to prevent the formation of blood clots, especially considering the patient's recent atrial fibrillation and NSTEMI.
4. Hematuria: The development of hematuria requires further investigation, and a consultation with urology has been requested.
5. Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM): The possibility of TBM needs to be evaluated further with a dynamic airway CT before discharge.
6. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of poor dentition and aspiration puts him at risk for recurrent aspiration pneumonia, especially if proper precautions are not taken.
7. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient's chronic GERD may continue to cause symptoms and contribute to aspiration events if not managed appropriately.
8. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which may require monitoring and management.
9. Charcot Tooth Disease: The patient's history of Charcot tooth disease may contribute to oral health issues and increase"
