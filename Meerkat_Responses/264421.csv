","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic heart failure, and pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization (RHC) but presented with acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient has been receiving diuretics, afterload reduction medications, and has had his blood pressure controlled. He is also being treated for atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/PE. The patient's liver disease is awaiting transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's low cardiac index (CI) and elevated systemic vascular resistance (SVR) suggest the need for increased afterload reduction. There is a risk of worsening heart failure if these goals are not met.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary artery pressures remain elevated due to left-sided CHF. This condition can lead to further complications such as right heart strain and failure.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient is awaiting liver transplantation and may develop complications related to liver dysfunction, including hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.
4. DVT/PE: Although the patient is on anticoagulation therapy, there is still a risk of thromboembolic events.
5. AFib: The patient's rate appears to be well-controlled, but there is still a risk of thromboembolic events and potential arrhythmia-related complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently well-controlled, but long-standing hypertension can lead to further organ damage if not managed properly.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to indwelling lines and catheters.
8. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored to avoid fluid overload or underload.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information from the patient's medical history, physical examination, and other diagnostic tests may provide further insights into the patient's condition and potential complications."

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for a right heart catheterization, which showed acute-on-chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient has been receiving diuretics, afterload reduction medications, and treatment for pulmonary hypertension. He is also on anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation and has a history of hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/82 mmHg to 127/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered end-expiratory wheezes bilaterally, with no rales or rhonchi. His abdomen is soft, with no tenderness, and he has no peripheral edema.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly high platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing diuresis to achieve a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 16-18 mmHg and aiming for a negative fluid balance of -2 liters"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cirrhosis of the liver. The patient has received various medications including furosemide (Lasix), which is commonly used to treat fluid overload in heart failure patients. 

The vital signs indicate that the patient is hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure within normal limits and a heart rate that is within the expected range for an ICU patient. The patient is also oxygenating well with a SpO2 of 95%. The presence of atrial fibrillation is noted, which can be common in patients with heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The fluid balance shows an overall negative balance, indicating that the patient is receiving less fluid than they are giving. This may be part of the management plan to address the heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The lab results show some abnormalities including an elevated BUN and creatinine, indicating possible renal dysfunction. The low albumin level suggests chronic liver disease or malnutrition. The elevated PT/INR suggests impaired blood clotting function, which can be associated with liver disease or anticoagulant use.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening heart failure symptoms, development of further arrhythmias, worsening liver dysfunction, and renal dysfunction. The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters. Additionally, stress ulcer proph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization, but due to acute-on-chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, he required ICU admission. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 108/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals a well-appearing individual with no acute distress, clear lung sounds, regular heart rhythm, and no peripheral edema. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms and diagnostic findings suggest acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, which can lead to worsening pulmonary edema, respiratory distress, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, which can result in right ventricular strain, right heart failure, and decreased oxygenation.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which increases"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, and presenting with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient has received diuretics and afterload reduction, but their effects are not yet optimal. The labs indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, suggesting possible kidney dysfunction. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a need for adjustment in anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 64-83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 81-137 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with an irregular rhythm.

The physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for a Swan-Ganz catheter site on the right side. The chest x-ray shows no acute changes.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a negative 820 mL balance over the past 24 hours, suggesting adequate diuresis. However, there is a concern about potential complications such as hypotension, worsening renal function, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization and was found to have acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient has been receiving diuretics and afterload reduction therapy, but his condition is not yet optimal. There may be a need for further afterload reduction, as indicated by borderline low cardiac index and elevated systemic vascular resistance. The patient's physical examination shows that he is well-appearing, with no acute distress. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood chemistries reveal slightly elevated creatinine and normal glucose levels. Coagulation studies show a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, with an elevated international normalized ratio.

The patient's plan includes continuing diuretics to achieve optimal pulmonary artery wedge pressure, assessing for fluid overload, and aiming for a negative fluid balance of -1"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary embolism (PE), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient was admitted for an elective right heart catheterization (RHC) and was found to have acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, and cirrhosis awaiting transplant. The medical team is working on optimizing the patient's preload due to inadequate diuresis, reducing the systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and managing other comorbidities such as hypertension and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure symptoms, fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy, infection, hepatic encephalopathy, and potential liver transplant rejection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamic status, renal function, electrolyte levels, and coagulation parameters. Frequent assessments of the patient's mental status and respiratory function are also necessary. Regular communication with the transplant team and strict adherence to the prescribed medications and interventions are crucial for the patient's well-being."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient is improving, with negative fluid balance of 4 liters. Diuretics have been adjusted to achieve a goal of -2 liters today. An evaluation wedge is planned for later in the day. The patient's electrolytes are stable, and there are plans to increase captopril as needed for improved afterload reduction. The possibility of discontinuing the Swan-Ganz catheter is being considered.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving but have not yet reached the preoperative target of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) less than 35 mmHg. This suggests irreversible pulmonary hypertension, especially considering the lack of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the right heart catheterization on [2139-3-16]. The patient will continue with amlodipine, although it is unlikely to produce a substantial response given the lack of vasodilator response. Treatment for left-sided heart failure will be continued as mentioned above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, along with other medical conditions such as portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, and a pulmonary embolism. The patient was admitted for an elective right heart catheterization to demonstrate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including diuretics and afterload reduction medications. The goal is to optimize the patient's pulmonary artery pressure (PAD) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). The patient's wedge pressure is being assessed today, and a target fluid balance of -1 L is set for the day. The patient's captopril dosage will be increased as needed for improved afterload reduction.

The patient also has pulmonary hypertension, which remains elevated due to left-sided heart failure. The patient is currently on amlodipine, although it is unlikely to produce a substantial response given the lack of vasodilator responsiveness. The treatment focuses on addressing the left-sided heart failure as mentioned earlier.

Regarding the patient's deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), heparin has been resumed for subtherapeutic INR, and the patient will continue on coumadin with a goal INR of 2-24.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, and pulmonary embolism. He is currently admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's chief complaints include acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's condition involves an exacerbation of chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, leading to fluid overload and pulmonary congestion. This can result in symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and fatigue.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has preoperative target mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of less than 35 mmHg. If this target is not consistently achieved, it may indicate irreversible pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right ventricular failure and decreased cardiac output.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, which needs to be controlled to prevent complications such as stroke and hemodynamic instability.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to chronic renal insufficiency. Acute kidney injury or worsening renal function may occur during diuresis and fluid management.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, and pulmonary embolism. He is currently admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current condition is improving, with diuresis goal of -2 L today. An echocardiogram is planned for evaluation. His electrolytes are managed by [Hospital1]. Captopril is increased as needed for improved afterload reduction. The possibility of discontinuing the Swan-Ganz catheter is being considered.

Regarding the patient's pulmonary hypertension, his pulmonary pressures are improving but not yet consistently at preoperative target of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg. This suggests irreversible pulmonary hypertension, also indicated by the lack of response to inhaled nitric oxide at the catheterization on [2139-3-16]. The patient will continue amlodipine, although it is unlikely to produce a substantial response given the lack of vasodilator response. Treatment for left-sided heart failure is also being implemented, as previously mentioned.

For deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, the patient will continue on coumadin (goal INR 2.0-3.0), and heparin will be discontinued since his INR is already 2.3"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, and other comorbidities including portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted for an elective right heart catheterization to evaluate for acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current condition is improving, with diuresis goals being met. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure. This condition can worsen if the patient does not respond to diuretic therapy or if there is a progression of heart failure symptoms.

2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving but have not yet reached the preoperative target of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg. If the patient's pulmonary hypertension does not improve or worsens, it may impact their candidacy for liver transplantation.

3. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE): The patient is currently on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and coumadin. If the patient's INR levels become subtherapeutic, there is an increased risk of DVT/PE formation.

4. Atrial fibrillation:"

The patient was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's condition is improving with diuresis. An evaluation of wedge is planned, and the patient will be considered for discontinuation of the Swan-Ganz catheter pending evaluation.

2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving but have not yet reached the preoperative target of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg. This suggests irreversible pulmonary hypertension, especially since there was no response to inhaled nitric oxide during the catheterization on 2139-3-16. The plan is to continue amlodipine, although it is unlikely to produce a substantial response due to lack of vasodilator response. Treatment for left-sided CHF will also be continued as above.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for an elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 52 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 98/57 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is in sinus bradycardia.

The patient has received therapeutic heparin and underwent DC cardioversion, which successfully restored normal sinus rhythm. He has also received Lasix 40 mg intravenously twice, and his medication regimen includes metoprolol tartrate, miralax, calcium carbonate, MVI, omeprazole, amlodipine, coumadin, lactulose, captopril, rifaximin, and senna.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for mild nausea yesterday relieved by Zofran and vomiting once. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are being closely monitored. His blood gases and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently admitted for elective right heart catheterization, demonstrating acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's hemodynamics are improving, with a reduction in left-sided filling pressures. However, his mean pulmonary artery pressures are still above the preoperative target of less than 35 mmHg, suggesting a consistent element of irreversible pulmonary hypertension, as evidenced by the lack of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the catheterization on [**2139-3-16**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is worsening, leading to increased left-sided filling pressures and potential exacerbation of heart failure symptoms.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: Despite diuretic therapy and vasodilators, the patient's mean pulmonary artery pressures remain elevated, indicating irreversible pulmonary hypertension. This can lead to right-sided heart failure and further complications.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis/PE (DVT/PE): The patient is at high risk for developing blood clots due to immobility and underlying conditions such as cirrhosis and chronic renal insufficiency. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin"

He was admitted for an elective right heart catheterization to demonstrate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient's current condition shows improvement in hemodynamics, with a loss of 4.5 liters of fluid. However, mean pulmonary artery pressures still need to be less than 35 in order to meet transplant requirements. To achieve this, continued diuresis to a goal of 1-2 liters negative today or until creatinine increases is planned. Lasix 80mg IV will be administered this morning, followed by as-needed use. Additionally, [Hospital1] will provide electrolyte management.

The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving but not yet at preoperative target levels. There is an element of irreversible pulmonary hypertension, suggested by the absence of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the catheterization on [2139-3-16]. Therefore, amlodipine will be continued, although it is unlikely to produce a substantial response.

The patient's deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) is being treated with continued use of coumadin, aiming for an international normalized ratio (INR) between 2.0 and "

1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's hemodynamics are improving, but mean pulmonary artery pressures (mPAP) need to be less than 35 to meet transplant requirements. The patient is close to dry volume status by exam and labs, so diuresis will be continued to goal of 500cc-1 L negative today. The patient's creatinine is likely to rise with this diuresis.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: Pulmonary pressures are improving but not yet consistently at preoperative target of mPAP 35 mmHg. There is an element of irreversible"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, who is admitted for elective right heart catheterization. The patient has a diagnosis of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (LV diastolic CHF) and pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 51 bpm, a blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus bradycardia. 

The patient's mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) is 35-37 mmHg, which needs to be less than 35 mmHg for transplant requirements. The patient is receiving IV lasix at a dose of 80 mg, and diuresis is being continued to goal of 1-2 L negative today or until creatinine (Cr) increases. The patient is also on captopril prn for improved afterload reduction and will be discharged from the Swan-Ganz catheter when documented consistent mPAP <35.

The patient was admitted for elective right heart catheterization due to acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current medical conditions and corresponding plans include:

1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's hemodynamics are improving, with a loss of 4.5 liters of fluid. To meet transplant requirements, the mean pulmonary artery pressures need to be less than 35. The patient will continue diuresis to achieve a goal of 1-2 liters negative fluid balance today or until creatinine levels increase. Lasix 80mg IV will be administered this morning, followed by as-needed use. The patient will also receive [Hospital1] electrolytes, increased captopril as tolerated for improved afterload reduction, and the Swan-Ganz catheter will be removed when documented consistent mean pulmonary artery pressure is less than 35.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, and various other medical conditions such as portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to assess acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's hemodynamics have improved, with a decrease in fluid loss. However, mean pulmonary artery pressures remain elevated at 40 mmHg, indicating that the patient is not yet at the preoperative target of mPAP 35 mmHg. There is also an element of irreversible pulmonary hypertension, as suggested by the lack of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the catheterization on 03/16/2139. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's mean PA pressures need to be less than 35 to meet transplant requirements. Continued diuresis is planned to achieve this goal, which may lead to an increase in creatinine levels.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: Although the patient's pulmonary pressures are improving, they are not yet at the preoperative target of mPAP 35 mmHg. This indicates a consistent element of irreversible pulmonary hypertension. Treatment strategies include continuing amlodipine and addressing left-sided CHF.
3. DVT/PE: The patient's INR level is within the target range of 2.0-3.0. Continuation of coumadin is planned to maintain this INR range.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient had successful cardioversion and remains in normal sinus rhythm. Rate control is maintained with lopressor, and coumadin will continue to be administered to maintain INR 2.0-3.0.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is increasing. Close monitoring of renal function while diuresing is recommended.
6. Cirrhosis: The patient's liver condition is stable while awaiting transplant. Rifampin and lactulose will continue to be administered.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, and beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers will continue to be used for management.
8. Fluid and electrolyte balance: The patient is being closely monitored for fluid and electrolyte imbalances, especially considering the planned diuresis.
9. Access and lines: The patient has a peripheral IV line and a Swan-Ganz catheter in place.
10. Medication regimen: The patient is on multiple medications including lasix, captopril, and amlodipine, among others."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, and has been admitted for elective right heart catheterization.
- The patient has multiple medical conditions, including acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension (HTN), deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic kidney injury (CKI), thrombocytopenia, and cirrhosis.
- The patient underwent cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and is currently in normal sinus rhythm.
- The patient's hemodynamics have improved, but the pulmonary pressures have not reached the preoperative target of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg.
- The patient's creatinine level has increased slightly during diuresis, indicating a possible worsening of kidney injury.
- The patient's platelet count has decreased to 100,000/mL, and there is an intermediate probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Tests for platelet counts and heparin antibody will be conducted.
- The patient's cirrhosis remains stable and is awaiting transplant. Medications such as rifaxamin and lactulose are being continued.
- The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, and beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers will be continued.
- The patient's sodium levels will be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/50 mmHg to 131/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and a sinus bradycardia heart rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 549 mL and output of 1550 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 1001 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of -3 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 42/13 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 7.2 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation of 76%.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 14.5 g/dL, glucose of 128 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, sodium of 135 mEq/L, chloride of 98 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL, and calcium of 8.6 mg/dL.

Plan:
The patient's plan includes continuing diuretics to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1 L today, checking platelets for thrombocytopenia, checking for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, monitoring liver function tests, continuing anticoagulation, and discussing endpoints with the transplant team."

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Hemodynamics are improving, and creatinine has remained stable despite diuresis. Diuretics will be continued to achieve a goal of 1 L negative fluid balance today. Hospitalized electrolytes will be monitored, and captopril will be continued. An attempt will be made to wedge the Swan to see if pulmonary artery pressures correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary pressures are improving but have not reached the preoperative target of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg. This suggests an element of irreversible pulmonary hypertension, also indicated by the lack of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the catheterization on [**2139-3-16**]. Amlodipine will be continued, although it is unlikely to produce a substantial response given the lack of vasodilator response. Treatment for left-sided heart failure will be continued as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute-on-chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's hemodynamics are improving, but he still has elevated creatinine levels. The plan includes continuing diuretic therapy, managing electrolytes, switching from captopril to lisinopril, attempting to wedge the swan catheter to correlate mean pulmonary artery pressure with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and treating left-sided heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's condition may worsen if his left ventricular diastolic dysfunction does not improve.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving, but they are still above the target preoperative level of 35 mmHg. This indicates irreversible pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to further complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 200 to 100, indicating a potential risk of bleeding. This could be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
4. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE): The patient's INR is within the therapeutic range, but there is a risk of DVT/PE due to immobilization and other risk factors.
5. Atrial fibrillation: Although the patient underwent successful cardioversion and is currently in normal sinus rhythm, there is a risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke.
6. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated, indicating potential worsening of renal function.
7. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is stable but requires ongoing management, including waiting for a liver transplant. Complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and variceal bleeding should be monitored for.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, but uncontrolled hypertension can lead to further cardiac complications.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex, and there are several potential complications that need to be closely monitored and managed."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, and multiple comorbidities including portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to demonstrate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Hemodynamics are improving, with a negative fluid balance of 6.8 liters and stable creatinine levels despite diuresis. The plan is to continue diuresis to achieve a goal of 1-2 liters negative today and monitor electrolytes.

2. Pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary pressures are improving but have not yet reached the preoperative target of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg. There is evidence of irreversible pulmonary hypertension, suggested by the absence of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the right heart catheterization on [**2139-3-16**]. The plan is to continue amlodipine therapy, although it is unlikely to produce a substantial response due to the lack of vasodilator response. Treatment for left-sided CHF will be continued as above.

3. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE): The patient's"

   with a acute on chronic diastolic left and right ventricular failure
   and was admitted for tailor therapy in the CCU with invasive
   monitoring.  He was diuresed an excess of 7 liters of fluid and his
   mean PA pressure in now 35 mmHg.  He has developed some degree of
   thrombocytopenia and we will evaluate its etiology. He is currently
   tolerating his dose of lopressor, Captopril, and Novasc in addition to
   his diuretics.  Our plan is outlined above and involves continued
   treatment of his acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  This plan
   was communicated with the patient and all questions were addressed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to demonstrate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's condition has been improving, with hemodynamics showing improvement and a decrease in creatinine levels despite diuresis. The patient continues to receive diuretics to achieve a goal of negative fluid balance of 1 liter today. His electrolytes will be monitored, and he will be switched from captopril to lisinopril 5 mg orally daily.

Pulmonary pressures are also improving, but not at the preoperative target of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg. There is an element of irreversible pulmonary hypertension, as suggested by the lack of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the catheterization on [**2139-3-16**]. The patient will continue with amlodipine, although it is unlikely to produce a substantial response.

The patient's platelet count has decreased from 200 to 100, which raises suspicion for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation is needed, including a recheck in the progress note and sending a heparin antibody test.

   I concur with the assessment and treatment plan as outline above.   Mr.
   [**Known lastname **] presented with a acute on chronic diastolic left and right
   ventricular failure and was admitted for tailor therapy in the CCU with
   invasive monitoring.  He was diuresed an excess of 7 liters of fluid
   and his mean PA pressure in now 35 mmHg, but has not changed
   significantly in the past 24 hours.  Our plan is outlined above and
   involves more aggressive treatment of his acute on chronic diastolic
   heart failure with intravenous diuretics.  This plan was communicated
   with the patient and all questions were addressed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to demonstrate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's hemodynamics have improved, but his pulmonary pressures are still not at the preoperative target of mPAP 35 mmHg. There is evidence of irreversible pulmonary hypertension, as indicated by the absence of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the catheterization. The patient's platelet count has decreased from 200 to 100, but it is recovering without intervention. His creatinine levels have remained relatively stable despite aggressive diuresis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - Hemodynamics improving, continue diuresis to goal 2-3 L negative today. Start Lasix gtt.
2. Pulmonary hypertension - Pulmonary pressures improving but not at preoperative target of mPAP 35 mmHg. Continue amlodipine and treat left-sided CHF as above.
3. Thrombocytopenia - Platelets decreased to 100 from 200 on admission, low pre-test prob for HIT. Recovering with no intervention, check platelets daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted for elective right heart catheterization and was found to have acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's hemodynamics are improving, but there is still a need for ongoing diuresis to reach the desired goal of 1-2 L negative fluid balance today. The patient should continue with diuretics, [Hospital1] electrolytes, and lisinopril 5 mg po daily.

2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving, but they have not reached the preoperative target of mPAP 35 mmHg. This suggests irreversible pulmonary hypertension, especially since there was no response to inhaled NO at cath [2139-3-16]. The patient should continue with amlodipine, even though it is unlikely to produce a substantial response due to lack of vasodilator response. Additionally, the patient should be treated for left-sided CHF as mentioned above.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 200 to 100 on admission. There is an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization and was found to have acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, thrombocytopenia, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, hypertension, and fluid/electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's hemodynamics are improving, but there is a need for continued diuresis to achieve optimal fluid balance.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving, but not at the desired target of mPAP 35 mmHg. This indicates irreversible pulmonary hypertension. Treatment should focus on managing left-sided CHF and controlling blood pressure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 200 to 100. This may be related to a condition called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Monitoring of platelet count is recommended.
4. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute-on-chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's hemodynamics are improving, but his pulmonary pressures are not at the preoperative target of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg. There is evidence of irreversible pulmonary hypertension, as indicated by the lack of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the catheterization. The patient's platelet count has decreased from 200 to 100, and there is a suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is 3.0, and Coumadin has been held. The patient remains in normal sinus rhythm after successful cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. The patient's creatinine level has increased slightly but is not in the range of acute renal failure. The patient's liver function tests are stable, and he is awaiting a liver transplant. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled on beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. He is also on medications for other conditions such as cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, and fever.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization, which revealed acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/85 to 127/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on several medications including lasix, lisinopril, coumadin, omeprazole, MVI, calcium, metoprolol, amlodipine, lactulose, rifaximin, and senna.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and platelet count within normal range. Liver enzymes are within normal limits, but kidney function is slightly impaired with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - Hemodynamics improving, continue diuresis to goal 2-3 L neg today, start lasix gtt, and continue lisinopril 5 mg po daily.
2. Pulmonary hypertension - Pulmonary pressures"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization and is now in the ICU for acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's hemodynamics are improving, but he still has a negative fluid balance of 2-3 liters. Diuretic therapy with lasix and diuril/metolazone will be continued to achieve volume balance.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving but not consistently at the pre-transplant target of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg. Inadequate diuresis and irreversible pulmonary hypertension may be contributing factors. Amlodipine will be continued, and treatment for left-sided CHF will be continued as well.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count remains stable. Daily monitoring will be continued.
4. DVT/PE: The patient's INR is therapeutic, and coumadin will be continued.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient underwent successful cardioversion and has been in normal sinus rhythm. Telemetry will be continued.
6. Chronic kidney disease:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and pulmonary hypertension. The patient has a known history of chronic heart failure and cirrhosis of the liver. 

The patient's current condition shows they are not meeting diuresis goals with bolus lasix, so they were started on lasix gtt with a 120mg IV lasix bolus. The patient's INR is 1.9, so coumadin was restarted. 

The patient's input/output checks show a negative balance of 900cc at 1400, and the lasix gtt was increased from 10 to 20mg/hr. At 1900, the I/O check showed a negative balance of 1600cc, and the patient was re-bolused with lasix 120mg IV. However, there was minimal response. 

The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamides), unknown; hives; and Cardizem (Oral) (Diltiazem Hcl), unknown; hives. 

The patient received infusions of furosemide (lasix) at a rate of 20mg/hr. Other ICU medications include furosemide (lasix) given at 08:00 PM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization, demonstrating acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including diuretics, afterload reduction medication, and calcium channel blockers. His hemodynamics have improved, but he still requires further diuresis to achieve volume balance. The patient's creatinine level has remained relatively stable despite diuretic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's condition may worsen if diuresis is inadequate or if there is a lack of response to treatment.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving but not consistently at the pre-transplant target of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg. This suggests that the patient may still have inadequate diuresis and an element of irreversible pulmonary hypertension.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, but it is important to continue monitoring it daily.
4. DVT/PE: The patient's INR is therapeutic, indicating that he is receiving appropriate anticoagulation therapy.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-appearing individual with a medical history of heart failure (diastolic), pulmonary hypertension, cirrhosis of the liver, and allergies to sulfa, unknown hives, and Cardizem. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the events noted below.

24-hour events include not meeting diuresis goals with bolus lasix, leading to the initiation of continuous lasix infusion at 20 mg/hr. The patient's INR was found to be 1.9, prompting the restart of coumadin. There were negative fluid balance checks at 1400 and 1900, resulting in an increase in the lasix gtt from 10 to 20 mg/hr and a subsequent bolus of lasix 120mg IV. However, there was minimal response. At 2300, the patient received a bolus of 500cc diuril.

The patient is currently on furosemide (lasix) infusion at 20 mg/hr and has received multiple lasix boluses. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5%), heart rate of 51 bpm (48-69), blood pressure ranging from 99/62 mmHg to 132/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (12-25), and oxygen saturation of 93%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, and several other medical conditions including portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization, which revealed acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's hemodynamics have been improving, but his creatinine levels have remained relatively stable despite diuresis. He has been experiencing some complications such as thrombocytopenia, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and cirrhosis. The patient is currently being treated with diuretics, lasix, lisinopril, amlodipine, and other medications for his various conditions. His sodium levels are low, and he is on a fluid restriction diet. The patient's current location is in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's left ventricular diastolic dysfunction may lead to worsening heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and increased cardiac workload.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving but not at the desired target. This can result in symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant. He has portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted for elective right heart catheterization due to acute-on-chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

Medical Complications:
1. Diuretic resistance: The patient did not meet diuresis goals with bolus lasix, so he was started on lasix gtt with 120mg IV lasix bolus. Despite this, there was minimal response to the diuretic therapy.

2. INR management: The patient's INR was 1.9, and coumadin was restarted. It is important to monitor and adjust the INR levels to maintain therapeutic range.

3. Fluid balance: The patient had negative fluid balance with output of 900cc, but it did not improve significantly despite aggressive diuresis. The total input-output balance showed a negative balance of 1714mL.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count decreased from 200 on admission to 100. Low pre-test probability for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) was considered, and platelets are being monitored daily. The platelet count is recovering without intervention.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, and other medical conditions.
- He is admitted for elective right heart catheterization due to acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient has been receiving diuretics to manage fluid balance, but there has been minimal response.
- His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 51 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 99/62 to 132/85 mmHg.
- Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolytes, and liver function tests.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable, and he is already on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
- His creatinine level remains relatively stable despite diuresis.
- The patient has a history of cirrhosis, well-controlled hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's condition involves acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure, which can lead to worsening pulmonary edema and respiratory distress if not properly managed.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can progress and cause right ventricular failure if not adequately treated.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, indicating a risk of bleeding"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/47 mmHg to 131/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 78 kg and the admission weight was 83.3 kg. 

The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 31 mmHg, and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) is 47/21 mmHg. The patient has received a total of 1,416 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 840 mL of output via the pulmonary artery catheter. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 11.1 to 12.5 thousand cells/mm³, hematocrit ranging from 42.2% to 47.2%, platelet count ranging from 100 to 136 thousand/mm³, creatinine ranging from 1.8 to 2.6 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 63 to 131 mg/dL. 

The patient's fluid balance over the past 24 hours is -834 mL. 

The patient has been on various medications, including furosemide at a rate of 20 mg/hour. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for new-onset diarrhea. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a heart rhythm of sinus bradycardia, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. 

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension exacerbation, fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), and gastrointestinal issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient's hemodynamics are improving, and his creatinine and bicarbonate levels indicate that he has likely reached dry weight. It is recommended to stop lasix infusion, determine the appropriate oral lasix dose, continue lisinopril for afterload reduction, and amlodipine for left ventricular relaxation.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving, with a target mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 35 mmHg. However, given his history of pulmonary embolism and possible portopulmonary syndrome, there may be irreversible pulmonary hypertension. The patient will be discussed with the transplant team, and amlodipine will be continued.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's INR is therapeutic, so he will continue on coumadin.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient underwent successful cardioversion and remains in normal sinus rhythm. Telemetry will be continued."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, along with portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted for an elective right heart catheterization to demonstrate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's recent events include a negative fluid balance, with 800 cc of fluid loss per day, an increase in creatinine from 2.0 to 2.6, and stable hemodynamics. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 93/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a Swan-Ganz catheter in place.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is well-appearing, with no significant abnormalities noted in his general, head/eyes/nose/throat, cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdominal, or extremity assessments. His laboratory results indicate normal levels of potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelets. However, his blood glucose level is low at 63 mg/dL, and his BUN level is elevated at 47.2 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, and is admitted for elective right heart catheterization. He has multiple medical conditions including portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's chief complaints are acute on chronic diastolic CHF and pulmonary hypertension. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 93/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and temperature of 36.7°C. The patient is well-appearing and has stable vital signs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's symptoms of acute diastolic CHF may worsen, leading to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving but there is a concern for irreversible pulmonary hypertension. This can lead to right-sided heart failure and decreased oxygenation.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating worsening renal function. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Pulmonary embolism: Although the patient is currently stable, there is a risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism, especially given his history of PE.
5. Atrial fibrillation"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature - 36.8°C (98.3°F), Heart rate - 54 bpm, Blood pressure - 93/47 mmHg, Respiratory rate - 21 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation - 95%
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) - 5 mmHg, Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) - 47/21 mmHg, Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) - 31 mmHg
- Fluid balance: Total input - 1,416 mL, Total output - 2,250 mL, Negative fluid balance - 834 mL
- Laboratory results: Hemoglobin - 15.5 g/dL, Hematocrit - 47.2%, White blood cell count - 11.1 K/uL, Platelet count - 128 K/uL, Creatinine - 2.6 mg/dL, Blood glucose - 85 mg/dL

Assessment and plan:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's hemodynamics are improving, and he has reached dry weight. Lasix infusion will be stopped, and the appropriate oral dose of lasix will be determined to maintain even fluid balance. Lisinopril will continue for afterload reduction, and amlodipine will continue for left ventricular relaxation.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving, with most readings reflecting pre-transplant target of mPAP 35 mmHg. It is likely that there is an element of irreversible pulmonary hypertension due to previous pulmonary embolism and possible portopulmonary syndrome. The patient will be discussed with the transplant team, and amlodipine will continue.
3. DVT/PE: The patient's INR is therapeutic, so coumadin will continue.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient underwent successful cardioversion and remains in normal sinus rhythm. Telemetry will continue.
5. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine level is rising despite aggressive diuresis, so electrolytes and creatinine should be checked.
6. Cirrhosis: The patient's condition is stable without evidence of decompensation, and he is awaiting transplant. Rifaximin and lactulose will continue.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, and the dose of lop"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 93/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is currently receiving furosemide intravenously at a rate of 20 mg per hour.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's hemodynamics are improving, but there is still a negative fluid balance of around 800 cc. The creatinine level has remained relatively stable despite diuresis. The patient will continue with lasix infusion along with diuril/metolazone as needed to achieve volume balance.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving, but not consistently at the pre-transplant target of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, who presented with acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure (LV diastolic CHF) and pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient underwent right heart catheterization (RHC) and responded well to aggressive diuresis, indicating improvement in hemodynamics and likely reaching dry weight.
- The patient's laboratory results show stable kidney function with a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, normal electrolyte levels, and slightly elevated white blood cell count.
- The patient's cardiac markers are within normal limits, and his liver enzymes are stable.
- The patient's coagulation profile indicates therapeutic INR levels.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib) but has been successfully cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm.
- The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), for which he is on warfarin therapy.
- The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cirrhosis, both of which are stable without evidence of decompensation.
- The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, and he has been weaned off lopressor due to bradycardia following cardioversion.
- The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 1 mmHg,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (HF), diastolic, acute on chronic, and pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). The patient's medical history includes COPD, emphysema, bronchitis, liver cirrhosis, and an allergy to sulfa, diltiazem HCl, and unknown agents causing hives. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/75 to 128/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 1 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is 44/16 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is 7 mmHg. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,202 mL total, including 73 mL of blood products, 822 mL of intravenous fluids (IVF), and 380 mL of oral fluids (PO). Output includes 1,750 mL of total output, consisting of 550 mL of blood products, 822 mL of IVF, 1,500 mL of urine, and 250 mL of nasogastric (NG) drainage. This results in a negative fluid balance of -548 mL.

The patient's blood work reveals a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 42.2%, platelet (Plt) count of 100, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.4 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 104 mg/dL, and other lab results within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include the patient's ongoing management of acute exacerbation of COPD, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension, as well as ineffective coping, knowledge deficit, and cirrhosis of the liver.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of COPD exacerbation leading to respiratory distress, progression of heart failure, further increase in pulmonary hypertension, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility, stress ulceration from prolonged ICU stay, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis awaiting transplant, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted for elective right heart catheterization demonstrating acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current condition indicates improvement in hemodynamics, with a decrease in liters of output (LOS) and Cr/HCO3 indicating likely reaching dry weight. The plan includes stopping lasix, determining the appropriate dose of lasix to maintain even fluid balance, continuing lisinopril for afterload reduction, amlodipine for left ventricular relaxation, checking electrolytes, BNP to establish dry weight value, and checking PCWP at dry weight prior to discontinuing the Swan-Ganz catheter.

Regarding pulmonary hypertension, the patient's pulmonic pressures are improving, reflecting pre-transplant target of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) 35 mmHg. However, there is an element of irreversible pulmonary hypertension due to the history of pulmonary embolism and possible portopulmonary syndrome (as suggested by the absence of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the catheterization on [2139-3-16]). The plan includes discussing progress and outpatient management with the transplant team, continuing amlodipine, treating left-sided heart"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, awaiting transplant, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to demonstrate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's hemodynamics have been improving, and there is a decrease in the amount of fluid lost overnight. The patient's serum creatinine and bicarbonate levels indicate that they have likely reached their dry weight. It is recommended to stop the lasix drip, determine the appropriate oral lasix dose needed to maintain even fluid balance, continue lisinopril for afterload reduction, and continue amlodipine for left ventricular relaxation. The patient's electrolytes should be checked, and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) test should be done to establish their dry weight value. The patient's pulmonary pressures are improving, reflecting pre-transplant target mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of 35 mmHg. There is likely an element of irreversible pulmonary hypertension due to the patient's history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and possible portopulmonary syndrome (as suggested by the absence of response to inhaled nitric oxide during the catheterization on [2139-3-16]). The patient will be discussed further with the transplant team, and the treatment plan will include"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation.
- The patient was admitted for an elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient's hemodynamics have been improving, and they have reached dry weight with a negative fluid balance.
- The plan is to stop lasix gtt, determine the appropriate oral lasix dose, continue lisinopril for afterload reduction, and amlodipine for left ventricular relaxation.
- The patient's pulmonary pressures are also improving, with a target mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 35 mmHg before transplant.
- The patient is currently on coumadin for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and telemetry is being continued.
- The patient's creatinine levels are rising despite aggressive diuresis, and electrolyte imbalances need to be addressed.
- The patient's liver function tests are stable, and they are awaiting transplant.
- The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, and lopressor dosage has been decreased due to bradycardia.
- The patient has a low sodium diet, fluid restriction, and is repleting electrolytes as needed.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate for acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current medications include lisinopril, amlodipine, coumadin, rifaximin, lactulose, and calcium channel blockers. He has been started on a low-sodium diet, fluid restriction, and repletion of electrolytes as needed.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 109/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and temperature within normal limits.

His hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 1 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 44/16 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 7 mmHg. His fluid balance is positive with a total input of 1,202 mL and output of 1,750 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 548 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 15.0 g/dL"

   HTN, chronic diastolic dysfunction, CRI, PE and Afib on coumadin
   admitted for elective RHC demonstrating acute on chronic LV diastolic
   CHF and pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   #Acute on chronic diastolic CHF- hemodynamics improving, -10L LOS;
   Cr/HCO3 indicating that likely has reached dry weight
   -start lasix 80 PO dose needed to keep even
   -daily weights; strict I/Os.
   -continue lisinopril for afterload reduction, amlodipine for LV
   relaxation
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -check BNP to establish dry weight value
   .
   #Pulm HTN
 pulm pressures improving with most [**Location (un) 103**] reflecting
   pre-transplant target of mPAP 35 mmHg; likely has element of
   irreversible pulm HTN given h/o PE, possible portopulmonary syndrome
   (as suggested by absence of response to inhaled NO at cath [**2139-3-16**])
   -will discuss progress/outpt mgmt with transplant team
   -cont amlodipine
   -cont treat left-sided CHF, as above
   .
   #DVT/PE - INR therapeutic
   -decrease coumadin dose to 4mg Qhs
   .
   #Afib
 s/p successful cardioversion, remains in NSR
   -telemetry
   .
   #CKD
 Cr rising in the setting of aggressive diuresis
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes, Cr

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for elective right heart catheterization to evaluate acute-on-chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's current medical conditions include acute-on-chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's acute-on-chronic diastolic congestive heart failure may lead to further deterioration of cardiac function, resulting in symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid accumulation, and reduced exercise tolerance.
2. Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing pulmonary hypertension may worsen due to various factors, including right heart catheterization, infection, or fluid overload. This could lead to increased pulmonary artery pressures and symptoms like dyspnea and fatigue.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency may progress, leading to worsening kidney function. This could result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid retention, and an increased risk of infections.
4. Hepatic decompensation: Although the patient's cirrhosis is"
