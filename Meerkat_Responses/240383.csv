   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 82 year-old female with a history of COPD,
   diastolic CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm
   elevation who presents with altered mental status/somnolence in the
   setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure, also with positive UA
   .
   Plan:
   # Respiratory distress: Her altered mental status and somnolence are
   likely due to hypercarbia, exacerbated by her UTI. CXR is unchanged
   from prior, arguing against new PNA.  She does not have leukocytosis
   but does have a left shift. Hypercarbic respiratroy failure is  likely
   multifactorial in etiology with underlying low lung volumes from
   elevated hemidiaphragm, bibasilar effusions, and respiratory muscle
   weakness due to dermatomyositis. Initial low O2 sats at [**Hospital1 238**] may have
   represented an aspiration event.  Given normal pH, she is likely not
   far off from baseline.
   Per OMR, the patient stated she that she would like to be DNR/I during
   her last admission, however, her son and daughter ([**Name (NI) 5351**]) have been
   having ongoing conversations with her regarding this.  They feel she
   would want intubation if it were to be brief (extensive family meeting
   held with daughter, attending and son via phone.
   -positive pressure mask ventilation to lower CO2
   -continue broad spectrum abx for now pending micro data
   -consider place a line for ABG monitoring
   -intubation if evidence of fatigue or failure of noninvasive
   ventilation
   .
   # Dermatomyositis:  Diffuse muscle weakness contributing to respiratory
   failure; exacerbated by deconditioning.
   -Continue home dose prednisone 15mg
   -consider Rheum and or neuro cconsult in AM (but both teams stated last
   admission that there was little more to do).
   -Aldolase level was checked last admission, WNL.
   -add on CK
   -PT consult once more stable
   .
   # Urinary tract infection: Positive UA with chronic catheter in place.
   Treated with 7 days of cipro last admit, but urine grew ESBL klebsiella
   and resistant pseudomonas. Pt has PCN allergy further limiting
   treatment options.  Not currently febrile or with leukocytosis.
   -change foley
   -resend UA/UCx
   -given levoflox/aztreonam in ED; would favor ID consult in AM for
   further treatment recommendations
   -trend fever and WBC curves
   .
   # HTN: On amlodipine, metoprolol and lisinopril as outpatient.
   -continue home meds
   .
   # Aortic stenosis, h/o diastolic heart failure: Recent echo done here
   showed mild aortic stenosis, valve area 1.2-1.9cm2.  No current need
   for diuresis.
   - home meds as above.
   .
   # Osteopenia: Continue calcium/vit D.
   .
   # Left Hip osteonecrosis:  chronic. asymptomatic. Refused xrays and
   ortho consul last admit.
   -continue calcium and vitamin D
   -outpatient f/u if desired
   .
   # Chronic pain: Continue lidoderm patch, gabapentin
   -hold oxycontin, nortriptyline in setting of resp failure; may restart
   once stable (or intubated)

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation.
- She was admitted from the ED and started on BiPAP. Her mental status gradually improved, and she transitioned to a nasal cannula.
- The patient coughed up tan sputum, which was sent for culture. She lost all IV access, and despite efforts, peripheral access could not be obtained.
- Fingerstick read in the 20s-30s, but a repeat fingerstick and an ABG showed a glucose level in the 130s. Glucagon 1 mg IM was given.
- The patient's allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and other medications are not mentioned.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, dry mouth, tachycardia, cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea.
- Flowsheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.
- Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, not in acute distress, and uncomfortable with some pursed lip breathing. There are crackles and wheezes in the chest, and peripheral pulses are diminished.
- Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient was admitted to the ICU due to hypercapnic respiratory failure and received non-invasive ventilation. Their mental status improved, and they transitioned from a nasal cannula to CPAP/PPS mode on the ventilator. The patient had productive cough with tan sputum, which was sent for culture. They experienced difficulty with obtaining peripheral IV access, and fingerstick glucose levels were initially in the 20s-30s but later confirmed to be in the 130s. Glucagon was given intramuscularly due to hypoglycemia.

The patient's allergies and medical history were obtained from the patient, family, and hospital records. The review of systems showed constitutional fatigue, dry mouth, cardiovascular tachycardia, respiratory cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea, genitourinary Foley catheterization, and no other significant findings.

Flowsheet data indicated vital signs with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/105 to 192/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm. Hemodynamic monitoring showed total input and output, fluid balance, respiratory support with nasal cannula and CPAP/PPS mode, and arterial blood gas values.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation.
- She presents with altered mental status/somnolence and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient has positive UA and is suspected to have a new pneumonia (PNA).
- She has diffuse muscle weakness contributing to respiratory failure, exacerbated by deconditioning.
- The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with resistant organisms, for which an ID consult is pending.
- She has no peripheral IV access and requires alternative access options.
- The patient's other medical conditions include aortic stenosis, osteopenia, left hip osteonecrosis, and chronic pain, for which appropriate management plans are in place.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and suspected PNA may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. UTI: The patient's UTI with resistant organisms can lead to worsening infection and potentially systemic complications if not appropriately managed.
3. Access Issues: The lack of peripheral IV access may hinder the administration of medications and fluids, increasing the risk of other complications.
4. Dermatomyositis Exacerbation: The patient's diffuse muscle"

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of dermatomyositis and COPD who presented with acute-on-chronic hypercapnia. She was admitted to the ICU and initially required intubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. During her stay, she developed a urinary tract infection (UTI) and was treated with levofloxacin/aztreonam. The patient's mental status improved, and she was extubated. However, she became confused and somnolent with hypoxemia, leading to her reintubation in the emergency department. She was placed on BiPAP and started on the same antibiotics.

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of dermatomyositis and COPD, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She has been experiencing difficulty breathing, confusion, and hypoxemia. The patient was initially intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) at that time. She was extubated and sent to another hospital but returned to the current facility due to confusion and hypoxemia. In the emergency department, she was started on BiPAP and given antibiotics. In the ICU, she lost IV access and had improved mental status and came off BiPAP. She reported chest congestion and was unable to expectorate. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and is currently on multiple medications for various conditions including COPD, dermatomyositis, and hypertension. She is also on steroids for her dermatomyositis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but her respiratory support is still required. Her ABG results show respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.50, high CO2 levels, and low oxygen saturation. Her chest X-ray reveals elevated right hemidiaphragm with bilateral effusion and low right lung volume with right basilar infiltrate. The patient has pending cultures and is being empirically covered with antibiotics. She has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) status. The plan"

   admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the setting of
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, also with positive UA
   # Respiratory distress: Patient with acute episode of hypoxia this
   morning along with transient low SBP to low 90s.  There was a question
   as to the validity of the hypoxia as O2saturation device showed a
   minimal tracing.  ABG done and showed 7.40/69/186/44.  Repeat ABG
   showed 7.4/71/84/46, which argue against hypoxia as paO2 is normal.
   Patient was placed on BIPAP given somnolence and ?hypoxia.  PE unlikely
   as Blood Pressures have normalized, currently SBP 130s, O2sat
   normalized and HR 90s to 100s which is her baseline.  ECG taken and
   showed no acute changes, only some flattened t waves.  Will ROMI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation. She was admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure, along with positive UA. The patient experienced an acute episode of hypoxia this morning, but subsequent ABG results showed normal oxygen levels. She was placed on BIPAP due to somnolence and potential hypoxia. Physical examination revealed mild crackles in the anterior and posterior lung fields, and labs showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, with normal glucose levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient had an episode of hypoxia, but subsequent ABG results were normal. She is currently on BIPAP and is stable.
2. Somnolence: Initial concern was hypercarbia, but ABG with baseline pCO2 ruled this out. Infection is considered the most likely cause of somnolence at this point.
3. Dermatomyositis: The patient has diffuse muscle weakness contributing to respiratory failure, exacerbated by deconditioning. She will continue her home dose of prednisone.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a positive UA and chronic catheter in place. She is being treated with Vanco/Levo/Aztreonam due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation. She was admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient also has positive UA and a recent echo showing mild aortic stenosis. 

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, which was pulled overnight by the patient. A peripheral IV line was successfully placed for access. The patient experienced an episode of acute hypoxia overnight and was started on BIPAP with improvement in oxygen saturation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 105 bpm (87-134 bpm), blood pressure of 117/73 mmHg (83-195/126 mmHg), respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (24-46 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on BIPAP. 

The patient is somnolent, opens eyes to verbal stimuli, and has mild crackles in the anterior and posterior lung fields. Her abdomen is distended but non-tender, and her extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. 

Lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 6.0 K/uL, normal platelet count of 271 K/uL, elevated blood glucose of 159 mg/dL, and slightly decreased sodium level of 130 mEq/L. Other labs are within normal ranges. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient had an episode of hypoxia this morning, but subsequent ABG results argue against hypoxia as the paO2 is normal. The patient was placed on BIPAP due to somnolence and possible hypoxia. PE is unlikely as blood pressures have normalized, and the ECG showed no acute changes. 
2. Somnolence: The initial concern was for hypercarbia, but ABG with baseline pCO2 argues against this. Most likely cause of somnolence at this point is infection. 
3. Dermatomyositis: Diffuse muscle weakness contributing to respiratory failure; exacerbated by deconditioning. 
4. Urinary tract infection: Positive UA with chronic catheter in place. Treated with 7 days of cipro last admit, but urine grew ESBL klebsiella and resistant pseudomonas. ID consulted and recommended Vanco/Levo/Aztreonam. 
5. Access: Pulled PICC line last night, will attempt an arterial line, if not then femoral line. 
6. HTN: On amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril as outpatient. Continue Metoprolol"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. However, there are several significant events documented. On [**2111-12-22**] at 04:00 PM, fluoroscopy was performed. Later that day, at 06:00 PM, a PICC line was started and placed in IR. The PICC line was stopped at 11:45 PM. The patient has allergies to penicillins and the last dose of antibiotics administered was Vancomycin at 06:00 PM on [**2111-12-22**] and Aztreonam at 03:17 AM on [**2111-12-23**]. 

The patient is receiving various infusions, including ranitidine for prophylaxis, metoprolol, and furosemide (Lasix). There are also changes to the patient's medical and family history, but they are not specified in the provided information. 

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Flow sheet data as of [**2111-12-23**] 08:18 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient's temperature ranges from 37.3 C to 36.6 C, heart rate is between 105 and 87 bpm, blood pressure ranges from 117/73 mmHg to 195/108 mmHg, respiratory rate is between 24 and 46 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. Total input and output measurements are provided, indicating a negative fluid balance of 1,565 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support with a bipap mask, CPAP/PSV mode, with specific settings for tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal limits. 

Physical examination findings are limited, with no assessments for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, or other body systems. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Kidney function tests, such as creatinine (Cr), are within normal limits. Other lab values, including blood glucose, lactic acid, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4), are also provided. 

The patient has been diagnosed with abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) and intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). Additionally, the patient is suspected of having a urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (22 and 20 gauge), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is not specified in the provided information."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of dermatomyositis, COPD, and chronic prednisone therapy. She presented with acute-on-chronic hypercarbia and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including:

1. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient has an infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Pseudomonas. This requires antibiotic treatment and further investigation.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute hypoxia, which could be due to various causes such as flash pulmonary edema, aspiration, cardiac event, or pulmonary embolism. Continuous monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary.

3. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS) / Intra-abdominal Hypertension (IAH): The patient is suspected to have ACS/IAH, which is a condition characterized by increased pressure within the abdomen. This can lead to organ dysfunction and requires prompt management.

4. Dermatomyositis: The patient has a history of dermatomyositis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the skin and muscles. She is on home prednisone therapy, and low threshold for stress dose steroids is advised due to her current critical condition.

5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has significant baseline hypoventilation related to her COPD. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory status are"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF,
   HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation who was
   admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the setting of
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, also with positive UA
   # Respiratory distress: Patient with acute episode of hypoxia this
   morning along with transient low SBP to low 90s.  There was a question
   as to the validity of the hypoxia as O2saturation device showed a
   minimal tracing.  ABG done and showed 7.40/69/186/44.  Repeat ABG
   showed 7.4/71/84/46, which argue against hypoxia as paO2 is normal.
   Patient was placed on BIPAP given somnolence and ?hypoxia.  PE unlikely
   as Blood Pressures have normalized, currently SBP 130s, O2sat
   normalized and HR 90s to 100s which is her baseline.  ECG taken and
   showed no acute changes, only some flattened t waves.  Will ROMI.
   Daugther notified about deterioration and meeting held this morning.
   Decision was for no further escalation of care.

   # Somnolence:  Initial concern was for hypercarbia but ABG with

   infection.
   # Dermatomyositis:  Diffuse muscle weakness contributing to respiratory
   failure; exacerbated by deconditioning.
   -Continue home dose prednisone 15mg

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation. She was admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure and positive UA. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, somnolence, urinary tract infection, access issues with IV lines, HTN, aortic stenosis, osteopenia, left hip osteonecrosis, chronic pain, FEN status, PPx, code status, and disposal concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing acute episodes of hypoxia, which may be due to hypercarbic respiratory failure or infection. The use of BiPAP has improved oxygen saturation levels.
2. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture for ESBL klebsiella and resistant pseudomonas. She is currently being treated with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Aztreonam.
3. Access Issues with IV Lines: The patient's PICC line was pulled last night, and an attempt will be made to place an arterial line if not successful, followed by a femoral line.
4. Hypertension: The patient is on amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril for her HTN. She will continue to receive metoprolol 5mg IV PRN.
5. Aortic Stenosis: Recent echocardiography showed mild aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.2-1.9cm2. No current need for diuresis is indicated.
6. Osteopenia: The patient will continue with calcium and vitamin D supplementation.
7. Left Hip Osteonecrosis: This is a chronic condition that is asymptomatic. The patient refused X-rays and an orthopedic consultation last admit.
8. Chronic Pain: The patient will continue with a lidoderm patch and gabapentin for chronic pain management. Oxycontin and nortriptyline have been held due to respiratory failure, but may be restarted once stable (or intubated).
9. FEN (Nothing by mouth) status: The patient is currently NPO.
10. PPx (Prophylactic measures): The patient is receiving SC heparin and an H2 blocker.
11. Code Status: The patient has a full code status.
12. Disposition: The patient is currently in the ICU.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any potential medical complications related to her respiratory distress, urinary tract infection, access issues with IV lines, hypertension, aortic stenosis, osteopenia, left hip osteonecrosis, chronic pain, FEN status, PPx, code status, and disposal concerns."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU due to abdominal compartment syndrome/intraabdominal hypertension (ACS/IAH) and septic shock secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with BiPAP, receiving IV fluids and antibiotics. He has minimal urine output despite receiving 4 liters of IV fluids. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 155/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose, and lactate levels. The patient's abdomen is distended, and he has a history of fecal contamination in his urine cultures. He has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic examinations. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS)/Intraabdominal Hypertension (IAH): The patient's distended abdomen indicates ongoing intraabdominal hypertension, which can lead to compromised organ perfusion and potential organ damage if not managed appropriately.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine cultures show signs of infection, and he is already receiving antibiotics. However, there"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF,
   HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation who was
   admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the setting of
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, also with positive UA
   # Respiratory distress: Patient with acute episode of hypoxia yesterday
   and was placed on BIPAP.  BIPAP removed this morning with good
   response.  Patient will likely need intermittent BIPAP throughout the
   day but will keep BIPAP off if possible
   -- cont BIPAP PRN
   --continue Vanco/Levo/Aztreonam
   -chest PT
   - f/u micro data
   # Somnolence:  Initial concern was for hypercarbia but ABG with
   baseline pCO2.  Most likely cause of somnolence at this point is
   infection.
   -- improved overnight with BIPAP and antibiotics, will cont to monitor
   # Dermatomyositis:  Diffuse muscle weakness contributing to respiratory
   failure; exacerbated by deconditioning.
   -Continue home dose prednisone 15mg
   .
   # Urinary tract infection: Positive UA with chronic catheter in place.
   Treated with 7 days of cipro last admit, but urine grew ESBL klebsiella
   and resistant pseudomonas. ID consulted and recommended
   Vanco/Levo/Aztreonam.  ID has now signed off.  Urine culture with fecal
   contamination.  Will repeat UA, if still with fecal contamination then
   will order CT scan for evaluation of possible uretocolonic fistula.
   Urine output has trailed off overnight, about 20cc/hr.
   -cont levoflox/aztreonam/vanc
   - trend fever and WBC curves
   - repeat UA/Ucx
   - IVF bolus PRN for goal Urine output > 30cc/hr
   .
   #Access: Mid line placed yesterday, will re-attempt PICC line
   .
   # HTN: On amlodipine, metoprolol and lisinopril as outpatient.
   -continue Metoprolol, Lisinopril.
   = add amlodipine if BP tolerates
   .
   # Aortic stenosis, h/o diastolic heart failure: Recent echo done here
   showed mild aortic stenosis, valve area 1.2-1.9cm2.  No current need
   for diuresis.
   - home meds as above.
   .
   # Osteopenia: Continue calcium/vit D.
   .
   # Left Hip osteonecrosis:  chronic. asymptomatic. Refused xrays and
   ortho consul last admit.
   -continue calcium and vitamin D

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation. She was admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure and positive urine analysis. The patient had an acute episode of hypoxia yesterday and was placed on BiPAP, which was removed this morning with good response. She will likely need intermittent BiPAP throughout the day but will keep BiPAP off if possible. The patient's urine output has been minimal despite receiving 4L IVF.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient had an acute episode of hypoxia yesterday and responded well to BiPAP. She will continue to need intermittent BiPAP throughout the day. 
2. Somnolence: The initial concern was hypercarbia, but the ABG with baseline pCO2 ruled this out. The most likely cause of somnolence at this point is infection, which improved overnight with BiPAP and antibiotics. The patient will continue to be monitored.
3. Dermatomyositis: The patient has diffuse muscle weakness contributing to respiratory failure, exacerbated by deconditioning. She will continue with her home dose of prednisone 15mg.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a positive UA with chronic catheter in place. She was previously treated"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of dermatomyositis, COPD, and chronic hypercapnia. She presented with acute respiratory distress and was found to have a new right lower lobe infiltrate/effusion, likely due to aspiration. The patient is clear about her wishes to be DNR/DNI and will receive morphine as needed while on NIPPV. She also has a complicated UTI with fecal contamination of urine and is being treated accordingly. The patient's condition has improved with the use of BiPAP, but she continues to have low oxygen saturation and requires further evaluation and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of NIPPV increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary.
2. Aspiration events: Given the new right lower lobe infiltrate/effusion, there is a risk of recurrent aspiration events. Measures to prevent aspiration, such as elevating the head of the bed and ensuring proper nutrition, should be implemented.
3. Complicated urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of fecal contamination in the urine indicates a complicated UTI. Appropriate antibiotic treatment and close monitoring of urinary symptoms are essential.
4. Hypotension and fluid balance: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower end, and there is a concern about maintaining adequate fluid balance."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of dermatomyositis, COPD, and chronic prednisone therapy. She presented with acute on chronic hypercapnia and was found to have respiratory failure. The patient has been on NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) and showed improvement in mental status. She has a new right lower lobe infiltrate/effusion, likely due to aspiration. She is currently on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam. The patient is DNR/DNI and will receive morphine on an as-needed basis while on NIPPV. She also has a urinary tract infection with fecal contamination and is being treated with antibiotics. Other findings include abdominal compartment syndrome/intra-abdominal hypertension, chronic bibasilar infiltrates, and chronic use of prednisone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sepsis secondary to urinary tract infection and aspiration pneumonia.
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome leading to organ dysfunction.
4. Potential need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
5. Risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to immobility.
6. Hypotension and shock due to sepsis or intra-abdominal hypertension.
7. Hypoglycemia due to chronic prednisone use.
8. Pressure ulcers and skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility.
9. Delirium or altered mental status due to sepsis, hypoxia, or medication effects.
10. Further complications related to intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation. She was admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure and positive UTI. The patient has continued to require BIPAP on an intermittent basis. The family meeting held today decided not to escalate care and will use bipap as needed. Antibiotics will be continued for treatment of UTI/Pneumonia. The patient also has dermatomyositis, urinary tract infection, hypertension, aortic stenosis, osteopenia, left hip osteonecrosis, chronic pain, and DNR/DNI status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's requirement of intermittent BIPAP indicates ongoing respiratory distress. If the patient's condition worsens, she may need invasive mechanical ventilation.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of resistant organisms including ESBL klebsiella and pseudomonas. There is a risk of treatment failure and progression of infection.
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, which could lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and mild aortic st"

- The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of dermatomyositis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and significant baseline hypoventilation.
- She presents with acute on chronic hypercapnia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and right diaphoretic elevation.
- The patient has chronic bibasilar infiltrates likely related to aspiration and chronic prednisone therapy.
- She is currently unable to wean off non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) due to recurrent aspiration, ineffective clearance, lack of steroid dose, and failed bedside swallow evaluation.
- The patient is clear about her wishes to be do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) and will receive morphine on an as-needed basis while on NIPPV.
- She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) that is improving, and antibiotic therapy will be continued for another 10 days.
- The patient requires intravenous steroid equivalent to oral dose for dermatomyositis.
- Her input/output status needs to be monitored, aiming for a urine output greater than 30 mL/hr.
- The patient's IV access needs to be readdressed due to an inaccessible peripheral catheter.
- The family discussed goals of care, DNR/DNI, feeds, and the patient's refusal of medications yesterday.

   days due to NPO status, failed bedside swallow eval yesterday. Too sick
   today to go for video swallow. On Vanc/Levo/Aztrenoam. CT if infiltrate
   doesnt improve. Iv steroid equivalent to oral dose for dermatomyositis.
     -Patient is clear in her wishes to be DNR/DNI. And we will use
   morphine on as needed basis only while on/ off NIPPV
   UTI: UA improved. Continue abx x 10 days

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of dermatomyositis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute on chronic hypercapnia. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress and has been placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) with Bipap. 

The patient has a chronic baseline hypoventilation and significant COPD with emphysema, presenting with acute respiratory failure. She also has chronic bibasilar infiltrates likely related to aspiration and has been on chronic prednisone therapy. 

The patient is unable to wean off Bipap, which may be due to recurrent aspiration, ineffective clearance, lack of steroid dose, or failed bedside swallow evaluation. She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) that is improving with antibiotics, and her dermatomyositis is being treated with intravenous steroids. 

The patient's goals of care include being DNR/DNI, and she refuses medications. Palliative care has been consulted, and supportive care will continue. If she loses consciousness, morphine and ativan will be started, and BiPAP and phlebotomy will be stopped if there is a subsequent decline in hemodynamics with progressive sepsis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration in mental status, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or worsening sepsis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema without acute exacerbation. The patient also has a history of abdominal compartment syndrome/ intraabdominal hypertension (ACS/IAH) and urinary tract infection (UTI).

24-hour events include placement of a midline PIC line, family meeting with pain and palliative care, agreement to no escalation of care, continuation of BIPAP for comfort, and continuation of current antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 137/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 421 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O, and arterial blood gas (ABG) results of pH 7.39.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,321 mL and output of 2,720 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,399 mL. The patient has received a total of 1,100 mL of intravenous fluids.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 27.0 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 256 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.5 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.03 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

Assessment and plan include altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without acute exacerbation, abdominal compartment syndrome/intraabdominal hypertension (ACS/IAH), and urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which is a common complication in ICU patients.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he is receiving CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation. There is a risk of respiratory failure if his respiratory function deteriorates further.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of UTI, and there is a risk of developing further infections due to his compromised immune system.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential fluid overload.
5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in kidney function (e"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation. She was admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure, also with positive UTI. The patient continues to require BIPAP on an intermittent basis. The family has agreed to no escalation of care, and the plan is to continue with BIPAP as needed. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for UTI/pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's intermittent need for BIPAP indicates ongoing respiratory distress. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure and potential need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Dermatomyositis: The patient has diffuse muscle weakness contributing to respiratory failure. Exacerbation of this condition may further impair respiratory function.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of ESBL klebsiella and resistant pseudomonas during the last admission. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance and potential complications such as sepsis or kidney infection.
4. Access Issues: The midline not flushing correctly, which may lead to complications related to IV access and administration of medications or fluids.
5. Hypertension: The patient is on multiple antihypertensive medications, but blood pressure remains elevated."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic right hemidiaphragm elevation. She was admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure and UTI. The family has agreed to no escalation of care, so the plan is for continuation of current care with an emphasis on comfort. The patient is receiving antibiotics for an ESBL Klebsiella urinary tract infection and potential pneumonia, as well as anti-hypertensives and chronic steroids for dermatomyositis. Intermittent BiPAP is being used for comfort, and morphine is available as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on BIPAP, there is a risk of developing VAP due to prolonged respiratory support.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylaxis should be considered.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving a stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, but stress ulcers can still occur, especially in critically ill patients.
4. Hyperglycemia: Glycemic control should be closely monitored, as the patient may be at risk for hyperglycemia, especially with the use of steroids for dermatomyositis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a medical history of COPD, CHF, dermatomyositis, and hypertension. She presented with altered mental status and a urinary tract infection from her nursing home. The patient has declined any escalation of care as per family wishes. She has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, famotidine, heparin sodium, and metoprolol. Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 168/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on CPAP/PSV with a face tent, FiO2 of 40%, and other ventilator settings. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress and a weak cough. The physical examination reveals rhonchorous breath sounds and soft, non-tender abdomen. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and shows purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.0, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 284 K/uL, sodium level of 115 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level of 40 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and glucose level"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, dermatomyositis, and chronic right hemidiaphragm elevation. She was admitted with altered mental status in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure and UTI. The patient's current condition is stable with no acute distress. She is on multiple medications including antibiotics, anti-hypertensives, and chronic steroids for dermatomyositis. Morphine is provided as needed. The patient prefers to wait for a video swallow evaluation before eating and does not want a PEG or NG tube if she is aspirating. There is no use of BiPAP in the past 24 hours, and the patient can be transferred to the floor. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a slightly elevated blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure. While her current condition appears stable, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if adequate ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained.

2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with an ESBL Klebsiella urinary tract infection and potential hospital-acquired pneumonia. Continuing appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial to prevent further infections and manage the existing ones.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's altered mental status and preference to wait for a video swallow evaluation"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of COPD and dermatomyositis who presented with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and received various treatments including antibiotics, heparin sodium, metoprolol, and famotidine. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/77 mmHg to 168/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's blood gases are pending. She has received supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and no signs of distress. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and potassium levels, as well as slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which could recur if she does not maintain adequate oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible ongoing infection or response to previous"
