   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82yo M with h/o ESRD on HD admitted with fevers
   and sepsis, likely [**2-10**] line infection.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Multiple sources for his infection including indwelling
   line, G-tube placed recently, PNA, chronic osteomyelitis of right
   ankle. Most likely is either osteomyelitis as recently d/c'd abx vs
   line infection.
   - Follow up cultures drawn in HD and do peripheral cultures here as
   were not done in ED prior to transfer to floor
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc (has h/o MRSA)/CFP ->
   will defer pseudomonal extended coverage, as PNA less likely than line
   infection.
   - IVF as needed to maintain pressures while transducing CVP to goal of
   12 as patient has h/o CHF will be more careful with IVF than usual ->
   current CVP 10, will give extra 500 NS in addition to maintenance D5NS
   at 100 cc/hr
   - follow up urine culture taken in ED ->currently covered for UTI with
   CFP
   - Will need line pulled likely today.
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:
   - Renal aware patient is here
   - No need for HD currently
   - Continue MWF schedule
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue home medications
   .
   #. PVD: Patient has h/o severe PVD with multiple amputations and
   chronic osteomyelitis in recent past.
   - Appreciate vascular recs
   - Will Rx with abx as above
   - Will continue home pain regimen with oxycodone, tylenol, lyrica.
   Morphine IV for breakthrough pain
   .
   #. HTN: Patient has h/o HTN but p/w borderline hypotension and possible
   septic shock, now normotensive
   - Will cont to hold anti-hypertensives for now pending treatment of
   sepsis.
   .
   #. Systolic CHF: Patient is currently hypovolemic with septic
   physiology.
   - Will hold lasix, diovan, and beta blocker as above
   - Will monitor CVP to ensure do not over-rescusitate given patient does
   not want to be intubated.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Very mild and could be [**2-10**] hypoperfusion in setting
   of transient hypotension in ED.
   - will hold statin
   - trend LFTs
   - consider RUQ U/S if does not resolve with fluids
   .
   #. Erythrocytosis: Hct is extremely high for him given baseline of
   mid-thirties on most recent hospitalization. Suspect hemoconcentration
   from combination of dialysis and sepsis.
   - will hydrate as above
   - will monitor daily hcts
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology given with infection usually get
   reactive thrombocytosis. Could be from nutritional deficiency given
   severe wasting and difficulty eating over last several months.
   - Will monitor plt count daily
   - Transfuse for plt<10K or <50K with evidence of bleeding.
   .
   #. Nutrition: Patient has recently been worked up for long h/o
   dysphagia which is likely [**2-10**] muscle weakness of deconditioning
   accompanied by severe reflux. Is now s/p G-tube placement for better
   nutrition supposed to start TFs today but because was at hospital did
   not get recs from VNA.
   - will have nutrition consult in am
   - NPO except meds for now given severe aspiration risk
   - Aspiration precautions

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis who was admitted to the ICU with fevers and sepsis. He has multiple potential sources of infection including an indwelling line, gastrostomy tube, pneumonia (PNA), and chronic osteomyelitis of the right ankle. The most likely cause of his sepsis is either osteomyelitis or line infection.

Plan:
- Obtain follow-up cultures to determine the source of infection.
- Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics covering MRSA and gram-negative bacteria.
- Monitor central venous pressure (CVP) and administer IV fluids as needed to maintain target CVP of 12, especially considering the patient's history of congestive heart failure.
- Consider removing the central line due to suspicion of infection.
- No dialysis is needed at this time.
- Continue renal dosing of medications and maintain the current dialysis schedule.
- Treat peripheral vascular disease with antibiotics.
- Continue home pain regimen and provide morphine IV for breakthrough pain.
- Hold antihypertensive medications temporarily.
- Hold medications for systolic congestive heart failure, transaminitis, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytopenia until further evaluation.
- Consult nutritionist regarding the patient's feeding tube and nutritional needs.
- Provide aspiration precautions.
- Maintain strict glycemic control.
- Monitor and manage lines, including a multi"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who was admitted with fevers and sepsis. The likely source of infection is either an indwelling line or chronic osteomyelitis of the right ankle. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and follow-up cultures have been drawn. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is low, so IV fluids will be administered as needed to maintain pressures. The patient's G-tube was recently placed, and he has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease with multiple amputations and chronic osteomyelitis. His blood pressure is currently stable, but he has a history of hypertension. The patient's systolic heart failure is being managed by holding diuretics and beta-blockers. The patient also has mild transaminitis, which could be due to hypoperfusion or hypotension. His erythrocytosis is likely due to hemoconcentration from dialysis and sepsis. Thrombocytopenia is being monitored, and the patient's nutrition is a concern given his severe wasting and difficulty eating. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, and there is a risk of further complications if the infection spreads or does not respond to antibiotics.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 1249**] has had rescucitation for sepsis likely related to his HD
   catheter. We will treat through the line and hope to salvage it ( per
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1458**]. He appears comfortable laying flat in bed with a CVP of
   10 and on no pressors at this time. If he should clear his bacteremia
   and remain stable off pressors, he will complete a full course of
   antibiotics on the floor and as an outpatient.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) admitted to the ICU with fevers and sepsis. The most likely source of infection is either an indwelling line or chronic osteomyelitis of the right ankle. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypertension (HTN), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), thrombocytopenia, erythrocytosis, transaminitis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and malnutrition. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/47 mmHg to 121/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals general emaciation, warm skin, and diminished peripheral pulses. Laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, as well as electrolyte imbalances. 

The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected line infection or osteomyelitis, monitoring central venous pressure (CVP), maintaining fluid balance, following up with urine culture, pulling the line likely today, and consulting with a nutritionist. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include septic shock, further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of malaise and tremor. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and impaired skin integrity. He was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient also has hypoglycemia and alteration in nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient already has end-stage renal disease, which can lead to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and difficulty in managing medications.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can increase the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and poor wound healing.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis is currently without organ dysfunction, it can progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately, leading to organ failure.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood glucose levels require close monitoring and management to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia, which can lead to neurologic complications if not corrected promptly.
5. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition may contribute to malnutrition and decreased immune function, making him more susceptible to infections and delayed wound healing.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82yo M with h/o ESRD on HD admitted with fevers
   and sepsis, likely [**2-10**] line infection.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Multiple sources for his infection including indwelling
   line, G-tube placed recently, PNA, chronic osteomyelitis of right
   ankle. Most likely is either osteomyelitis as recently d/c'd abx vs
   line infection.
   - Follow up cultures drawn in HD outside, and here (post abx)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc (has h/o MRSA)/CFP ->
   will defer pseudomonal extended coverage, as PNA less likely than line
   infection.
   - IVF as needed to maintain pressures while transducing CVP to goal of
   12 as patient has h/o CHF will be more careful with IVF than usual ->
   current CVP 10, will give extra 500 NS in addition to maintenance D5NS
   at 100 cc/hr
   - follow up urine culture taken in ED ->currently covered for UTI with
   CFP
   - Will need line pulled likely today.
   - f/u stool studies
   - f/[**Location 39**] CT read
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:
   - Renal aware patient is here; will f/u recs regarding pulling HD line
   - No need for HD currently
   - Continue MWF schedule
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue home medications
   .
   #. PVD: Patient has h/o severe PVD with multiple amputations and
   chronic osteomyelitis in recent past.
   - Appreciate vascular recs
   - Will Rx with abx as above
   - Will continue home pain regimen with oxycodone, tylenol, lyrica.
   Morphine IV for breakthrough pain
   .
   #. HTN: Patient has h/o HTN but p/w borderline hypotension and possible
   septic shock, now normotensive
   - Will cont to hold anti-hypertensives for now pending treatment of
   sepsis.
   .
   #. Systolic CHF: Patient is currently hypovolemic with septic
   physiology.
   - Will hold lasix, diovan, and beta blocker as above
   - Will monitor CVP to ensure do not over-rescusitate given patient does
   not want to be intubated.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Very mild and could be [**2-10**] hypoperfusion in setting
   of transient hypotension in ED.
   - will hold statin
   - trend LFTs
   - consider RUQ U/S if does not resolve with fluids
   .
   #. Erythrocytosis: Hct is extremely high for him given baseline of
   mid-thirties on most recent hospitalization. Suspect hemoconcentration
   from combination of dialysis and sepsis.
   - will hydrate as above
   - will monitor daily hcts
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology given with infection usually get
   reactive thrombocytosis. Could be from nutritional deficiency given
   severe wasting and difficulty eating over last several months.
   - Will monitor plt count daily
   - Transfuse for plt<10K or <50K with evidence of bleeding.
   .
   #. Nutrition: Patient has recently been worked up for long h/o
   dysphagia which is likely [**2-10**] muscle weakness of deconditioning
   accompanied by severe reflux. Is now s/p G-tube placement for better
   nutrition supposed to start TFs today but because was at hospital did
   not get recs from VNA.
   - will have nutrition consult in am
   - NPO except meds for now given severe aspiration risk
   - Aspiration precautions
   .
   #. FEN: IVF to maintain CVP~10. E- per HD N- TF in am pending Nutrition
   recs
   #. PPX: Hep SC
   #. ACCESS: RIJ CVL
   #. COMMUNICATION: With patient and wife

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82yo M with h/o ESRD on HD admitted with fevers
   and sepsis, likely [**2-10**] line infection.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Multiple sources for his infection including indwelling
   line, G-tube placed recently, PNA, chronic osteomyelitis of right
   ankle. Most likely is either osteomyelitis as recently d/c'd abx vs
   line infection.
   - Follow up cultures drawn in HD outside, and here (post abx)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc (has h/o MRSA)/CFP ->
   will defer pseudomonal extended coverage, as PNA less likely than line
   infection.
   - IVF as needed to maintain pressures while transducing CVP to goal of
   12 as patient has h/o CHF will be more careful with IVF than usual ->
   current CVP 10, will give extra 500 NS in addition to maintenance D5NS
   at 100 cc/hr
   - follow up urine culture taken in ED ->currently covered for UTI with
   CFP
   - Discuss w/ renal over possible d/c of femoral line. Leaving  in for
   now.
   - f/u stool studies
   - f/[**Location 39**] CT read
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:
   - Renal aware patient is here; will f/u recs regarding pulling HD line
   - No need for HD currently
   - Continue MWF schedule
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue home medications
   .
   #. PVD: Patient has h/o severe PVD with multiple amputations and
   chronic osteomyelitis in recent past.
   - Appreciate vascular recs
   - Will Rx with abx as above
   - Will continue home pain regimen with oxycodone, tylenol, lyrica.
   Morphine IV for breakthrough pain
   .
   #. HTN: Patient has h/o HTN but p/w borderline hypotension and possible
   septic shock, now normotensive
   - Will cont to hold anti-hypertensives for now pending treatment of
   sepsis.
   .
   #. Systolic CHF: Patient is currently hypovolemic with septic
   physiology.
   - Will hold lasix, diovan, and beta blocker as above
   - Will monitor CVP to ensure do not over-rescusitate given patient does
   not want to be intubated.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Very mild and could be [**2-10**] hypoperfusion in setting
   of transient hypotension in ED.
   - will hold statin
   - trend LFTs
   - consider RUQ U/S if does not resolve with fluids
   .
   #. Erythrocytosis: Hct is extremely high for him given baseline of
   mid-thirties on most recent hospitalization. Suspect hemoconcentration
   from combination of dialysis and sepsis.
   - will hydrate as above
   - will monitor daily hcts
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology given with infection usually get
   reactive thrombocytosis. Could be from nutritional deficiency given
   severe wasting and difficulty eating over last several months.
   - Will monitor plt count daily
   - Transfuse for plt<10K or <50K with evidence of bleeding.
   .
   #. Nutrition: Patient has recently been worked up for long h/o
   dysphagia which is likely [**2-10**] muscle weakness of deconditioning
   accompanied by severe reflux. Is now s/p G-tube placement for better
   nutrition supposed to start TFs today but because was at hospital did
   not get recs from VNA.
   - will have nutrition consult in am
   - NPO except meds for now given severe aspiration risk
   - Aspiration precautions
   .
   #. FEN: IVF to maintain CVP~10. E- per HD N- TF in am pending Nutrition
   recs
   #. PPX: Hep SC
   #. ACCESS: RIJ CVL
   #. COMMUNICATION: With patient and wife
   #. CODE: DNR/DNI
   #. DISPO: ICU for now.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) admitted to the ICU with fevers and sepsis, likely due to a central line infection. The patient has multiple potential sources of infection including an indwelling line, a recently placed gastrostomy tube (G-tube), pneumonia (PNA), and chronic osteomyelitis of the right ankle. 

The assessment and plan include:
1. Sepsis: Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin (Vanc) and cefepime (CFP), deferring pseudomonal extended coverage as PNA is less likely than line infection. Monitor for any signs of improvement or deterioration.
2. ESRD on HD: Renal aware patient, follow up recommendations regarding pulling HD line. No need for HD currently, continue MWF schedule, renally dose meds, and continue home medications.
3. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): Appreciate vascular recs, will Rx with abx as above, and continue home pain regimen with oxycodone, tylenol, lyrica, and morphine IV for breakthrough pain.
4. Hypertension (HTN): Hold anti-hypertensives for now pending treatment of sepsis.
5. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Hold lasix, diovan, and beta-block"
