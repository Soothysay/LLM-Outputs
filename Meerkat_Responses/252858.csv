   Assessment and Plan:
   78 yo Chinese male with new diagnosis [**Hospital 4230**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] in acute
   respiratory distress soon after cytarabine and idarubicin
   administration.
   .
   #Respiratory Distress: Patient with tachypnea, stridor, and accessory
   muscle use roughly one hour after cytarabine and idarubicin
   administration.  He was suspected to have an anaphylactic reaction and
   was given solumedrol 125mg IV X1, benadryl 25mg IV X1, epinephrine .3mg
   IM X1, and inhaled racemic epinephrine without response.  Anesthesia
   did not report airway swelling or edema during intubation, making
   anaphylaxis less likely. [**Month (only) 11**] also be from transfusion reaction, as it
   was reported that his temperature increased during transfusion today.
   Will continue with IV steroids and get chest CTA to tule out PE, given
   left lower extremity swelling.
   -Intubation
   -IV decadron
   -chest CTA
   .
   #Tachycardia: HR 160's on presentation.  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to fever,
   respiratory distress, and IM epinephrine.  EKG appears to be sinus
   tachycardia.  Will avoid beta blockers in setting of epinephrine
   administration.  Will bolus with fluid and consider diltiazem. Will
   also use propofol and fentanyl for sedation.
   -Fluid Bolus
   -Dilt prn
   -avoid BB
   .
   #Fever:103.2 on presentation. Patient is neutropenic.  On cefepime for
   UTI. [**Month (only) 11**] be from chemotherapy vs. infection vs. AML.  Will cover with
   Vancomycin, given PICC placement.
   -Continue cefepime
   -Add vancomycin

   .
   #Echymoses:extending from left buttock to just behind knee. History of
   bone marrow biopsy last friday, complicated by left gluteal hematoma
   without active extravasation. We are unsure if the echymoses is new, or
   is a result of this hematoma 1 week ago, however, the patient did have
   a 6 point hematocrit drop overnight.  he has also received 5 units of
   prbcs since [**3-1**]. The left leg is also more swollen than the right,
   raising concern for DVT.
   -Will get pelvis and left leg CT, looking for hematoma.
   -if no PE detected on chest CTA, will get ultrasound of left leg.
   -check coags
   .
   #AML - Had first dose of cytarabine and idarubicin today.  Will not be
   able to continue given anaphylaxis. Future therapy will be per oncology
   team.
   .
   #. Anemia - Combination of AML and gluteal hematoma.  will check lysis
   labs and coags. transfuse if actively bleeding.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old Chinese male with a new diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, anemia, and other medical conditions. The patient presented to the hospital with symptoms of tachypnea, stridor, and accessory muscle use shortly after receiving cytarabine and idarubicin administration. He was suspected to have an anaphylactic reaction but did not respond to treatment with solute, benadryl, epinephrine, and inhaled racemic epinephrine.

The patient's respiratory distress was initially attributed to anaphylaxis or a transfusion reaction, but anesthesia did not report any airway swelling or edema during intubation, making anaphylaxis less likely. The patient's temperature increased during transfusion, raising the possibility of a transfusion reaction. The plan is to continue with IV steroids and perform a chest CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE), given the left lower extremity swelling.

The patient's tachycardia is likely secondary to fever, respiratory distress, and IM epinephrine. An EKG shows sinus tachycardia. Beta blockers should be avoided in the setting of epinephrine administration. Fluid bolus, diltiazem, propofol, and fentanyl will be used for sedation.

The patient has a fever of 103.2, which may be due to chemotherapy, infection,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a new diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, anemia, and other complications. He was transferred to the ICU in acute respiratory distress shortly after receiving cytarabine and idarubicin. The patient had tachypnea, stridor, and accessory muscle use, which raised suspicion for anaphylaxis. However, anesthesia did not report any airway swelling or edema during intubation, making anaphylaxis less likely.

The patient's temperature increased during transfusion, but the blood bank reported no transfusion reaction. A CT angiography overnight ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE), although there were two small recanalized PEs and a pulmonary nodule. The patient is currently doing well on [5-20] with a cuff leak and is expected to be extubated today. Post-extubation ABG will be monitored.

The patient had a heart rate of 160's on presentation, likely secondary to fever, respiratory distress, and IM epinephrine. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia, which has since resolved. The patient's fever is 103.2, and he is neutropenic. Cefepime has been initiated for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Additionally, vancomycin has been started due to the PICC placement.

The patient has echymoses extending from the left buttock to just behind the knee,"

Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient presented with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, stridor, and accessory muscle use. Chest CTA was performed without new pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's heart rate was in the 160s on presentation but has since resolved. 

The patient also has neutropenic fever of unclear origin, for which he is receiving cefepime and vancomycin. He has echymoses extending from his left buttock to just behind his knee, likely due to a recent bone marrow biopsy complicated by a left gluteal hematoma. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging reveals old recanalized PEs, a left pleural-based nodule, and posterior atelectasis. 

Plan:
The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was admitted last week. He presented with respiratory distress, suspected anaphylaxis or transfusion reaction, and required intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including neutropenic fever, tachycardia, echymoses, and AML. He is currently being treated with antibiotics, blood products, and chemotherapy drugs. The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and required intubation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise due to underlying AML, potential infection, or complications from mechanical ventilation.
2. Neutropenic Fever: The patient has an unclear source of fever and is at risk for infections due to neutropenia. This increases the risk of sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Tachycardia: The patient had an elevated heart rate on presentation, which could be secondary to fever, respiratory distress, or administration of epinephrine. Tachycardia can lead to decreased cardiac output and end-organ hypoperfusion.
4. Echymoses: The patient has extensive ecchymoses extending from the left buttock to just behind the knee. These may be related to a previous bone marrow biopsy complicated by a left gluteal hematoma."

   78 yo Chinese male with new diagnosis [**Hospital 4230**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] in acute
   respiratory distress soon after cytarabine and idarubicin
   administration.
   #Respiratory Distress: Patient with tachypnea, stridor, and accessory
   muscle use roughly one hour after cytarabine and idarubicin
   administration.  He was suspected to have an anaphylactic reaction and
   was given solumedrol 125mg IV X1, benadryl 25mg IV X1, epinephrine .3mg
   IM X1, and inhaled racemic epinephrine without response.  Anesthesia
   did not report airway swelling or edema during intubation, making
   anaphylaxis less likely. Was thought to possibly be from transfusion
   reaction, as it was reported that his temperature increased during
   transfusion- however per blood bank, there was no transfusion rxn.  CTA
   overnight ruled out PE although there were 2 v small recanulated PE
   and a pulm nodule. S/p extubation on [**2194-3-7**] and is breathing
   comfortably but etiology of respiratory distress remains unclear.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old Chinese male with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He was transferred to the ICU in acute respiratory distress after receiving cytarabine and idarubicin. The patient had an allergic reaction to the chemotherapy, and despite receiving treatment for anaphylaxis, he did not show improvement. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated but was successfully extubated without complications. The patient's respiratory distress remains unclear, and further evaluation is needed. 

The patient has several other medical issues, including febrile neutropenia, echymoses, AML, anemia, transaminitis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). He is receiving appropriate treatments for these conditions, including antibiotics, chemotherapy, blood transfusions, and medication for his diabetes. The patient's blood work shows some abnormalities, including low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to various causes, including anaphylaxis, transfusion reaction, or pneumonia. Further investigation is necessary to determine the exact cause and prevent future episodes.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient is at risk for infections due to his low white blood cell count. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment with antibiotics are crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo Chinese male with new diagnosis [**Hospital 4230**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] in acute
   respiratory distress soon after cytarabine and idarubicin
   administration.
   #Respiratory Distress: Patient with tachypnea, stridor, and accessory
   muscle use roughly one hour after cytarabine and idarubicin
   administration.  He was suspected to have an anaphylactic reaction and
   was given solumedrol 125mg IV X1, benadryl 25mg IV X1, epinephrine .3mg
   IM X1, and inhaled racemic epinephrine without response.  Anesthesia
   did not report airway swelling or edema during intubation, making
   anaphylaxis less likely. Was thought to possibly be from transfusion
   reaction, as it was reported that his temperature increased during
   transfusion- however per blood bank, there was no transfusion rxn.  CTA
   overnight ruled out PE although there were 2 v small recanulated PE
   and a pulm nodule. Doing well on [**5-20**] this am with a cuff leak.
   -extubated today
   -monitor post extubation ABG
   #Tachycardia: HR 160's on presentation.  Likely secondary to
   combination of fever, respiratory distress, and IM epinephrine.  EKG
   sinus tachycardia.  Has resolved. Will monitor
   #Fever:103.2 on presentation. Patient is neutropenic.  On cefepime for
   UTI. [**Month (only) 11**] be from chemotherapy vs. infection vs. AML.  Will cover with
   Vancomycin, given PICC placement.
   -Continue cefepime, vanco
   -blood, sputum, urine cx.
   #Echymoses:extending from left buttock to just behind knee. History of
   bone marrow biopsy last friday, complicated by left gluteal hematoma
   without active extravasation. .Had a 6 point hematocrit drop 2/18. CT
   pelvis showed no acute change in size of hematoma on prelim read
   -f/u final CT pelvis read
   -LENI
s today given swelling of left leg
   -trend Hct, plt, CK.
   #AML - Had first dose of cytarabine and idarubicin [**3-6**].  Will not be
   able to continue given anaphylaxis. Future therapy will be per oncology
   team.
   -f/u heme onc recs
   #. Anemia - Combination of AML and gluteal hematoma.
   - transfuse for Hct <25, plt<50
   #.Transaminitis: Possibly form reactivation of Hep B, as is HepB core
   IgM positive.
   - continue lamivudine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 78-year-old Chinese male with new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transferred to ICU in acute respiratory distress after receiving cytarabine and idarubicin.
- The patient's respiratory distress was initially suspected to be an anaphylactic reaction, but it was later ruled out as there was no airway swelling or edema during intubation.
- The patient's temperature increased during transfusion, but the blood bank reported no transfusion reaction.
- A CT angiogram overnight ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE) although there were two small recanalized PEs and a pulmonary nodule present.
- The patient has a history of bone marrow biopsy complicated by a left gluteal hematoma without active extravasation, resulting in a 6-point hematocrit drop.
- The patient is neutropenic and on cefepime for urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient's echymoses extend from the left buttock to just behind the knee, likely due to the bone marrow biopsy.
- The patient received the first dose of cytarabine and idarubicin but will not be able to continue chemotherapy due to anaphylaxis.
- The patient's anemia is a combination of AML and gluteal hematoma, and they require transfusion for Hct <25, plt<50.
- The patient has transaminitis, possibly from reactivation of Hepatitis B, and will continue on lamivudine.
- The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and requires insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for now and is receiving bowel regimen, protonix, and pneumoboots prophylaxis.
- The patient's disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient presented with acute respiratory distress soon after receiving chemotherapy drugs cytarabine and idarubicin. This could be due to an allergic reaction, transfusion reaction, or other causes such as infection or pulmonary embolism.
2. Tachycardia: The patient had a heart rate of 160's on presentation, which could be secondary to fever, respiratory distress, and intramuscular epinephrine administration. It has since resolved.
3. Fever: The patient had a fever of 103.2 degrees on presentation. As a neutropenic patient, this could be due to infection, chemotherapy, or AML itself. Appropriate antibiotics have been initiated, and further investigations are planned.
4. Echymoses: The patient has extensive echymoses from the left buttock to just behind the knee, likely resulting from the bone marrow biopsy. This could indicate a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a combination of AML and gluteal hematoma. Trans"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was admitted last week after experiencing respiratory distress and potential anaphylaxis or transfusion reaction. The patient required intubation and was transferred to the ICU.

The patient's current status is as follows:
- Respiratory distress has resolved, and the patient was successfully extubated.
- Tachycardia is resolved.
- Neutropenic fever is currently not present, and the patient is on cefepime and vancomycin empiric antibiotics pending culture data. Cultures are being followed up, and trend counts show that the patient remains neutropenic.
- The patient has ecchymoses extending from the left buttock to just behind the knee. This is a complication from a recent bone marrow biopsy that also resulted in a left gluteal hematoma. Vascular access was obtained overnight, but no compartment syndrome was found. The ecchymoses are being monitored, and no active extravasation was observed.
- The patient's AML is being managed by the hematology team, and there are concerns regarding future chemotherapy. The family wants to discuss this with the oncology team before restarting treatment. Blood products are being given to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) level of 25 and platelet count (Plts) of 50.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood"

   IM X1, and inhaled racemic epinephrine without response.  Anesthesia
   did not report airway swelling or edema during intubation, making
   anaphylaxis less likely. Was thought to possibly be from transfusion
   reaction, as it was reported that his temperature increased during
   transfusion- however per blood bank, there was no transfusion rxn.  CTA

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a new diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, possibly due to anaphylaxis after receiving cytarabine and idarubicin. He also has anemia, febrile neutropenia, echymoses, AML, anemia, transaminitis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with various medications and therapies. The etiology of his respiratory distress remains unclear.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires close monitoring and management. If not appropriately treated, it can lead to hypoxia and subsequent organ damage.

2. Anaphylaxis: Although the patient has been treated for anaphylaxis, there is still a risk of recurrence. Close monitoring and prompt administration of epinephrine are crucial in case of another anaphylactic reaction.

3. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient's neutropenic state increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotics are necessary to prevent or treat any potential infections.

4. Echymoses: The patient has extensive echymoses extending from his left buttock to just behind the knee. This could be a result of a recent bone marrow biopsy complicated by a left gluteal hematoma. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding or worsening hematoma is important.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and concerns of anaphylaxis or transfusion reaction. The patient required intubation but is now extubated and doing well for two days. The etiology of the respiratory distress remains unclear.

The patient also had tachycardia, which has resolved, and neutropenic fever that is currently afebrile for 48 hours. The patient is still neutropenic, and cultures are pending. Empiric antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) have been started, and the patient's blood counts are being monitored.

Additionally, the patient has multiple echymoses extending from the left buttock to just behind the knee. This is believed to be related to a recent bone marrow biopsy that resulted in a left gluteal hematoma without active extravasation. There is no compartment syndrome, and the patient is receiving blood products to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) of 25 and platelets (Plts) of 50.

The patient's AML is being managed by the heme team, and chemotherapy was restarted yesterday without any adverse effects. The patient's condition appears to be stable at this time."
