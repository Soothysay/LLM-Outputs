   Assessment and Plan
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   73 y/o man with shock and acute renal failure in the setting of chronic
   respiratory failure.  We will plan:
          Presumptively septic.  Most likely source is lung or urine
   (or both).
          Cover HCAP/VAP as well as UTI.  Change Zosyn to cefepime
   given prior micro.
          Influenza DFA (seems low [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] no empiric rx)
          Remove PICC and culture.  Remove fem line (new)
          Echo today, and consult cardiology given abnormal rhythm,
   positive trop, abnormal EKG, etc.
          Carotid ultrasound to eval ED ultrasound findings
          No pharmacologic DVT proph given HIT and renal failure

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 73-year-old man with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He has a history of chronic respiratory failure and is now presenting with sepsis, most likely originating from the lungs or urinary tract. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires immediate attention and intervention.

The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension and tachycardia. His heart rhythm is junctional, and he has decreased breath sounds on the right base. There is also evidence of edema in both lower extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin levels.

The patient's treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. The antibiotics will be changed based on prior microbial sensitivities. An echocardiogram will be performed to assess the patient's cardiac function, and a carotid ultrasound will be done to evaluate the findings from the emergency department.

The patient's nutrition will be managed through parenteral nutrition for now, and glycemic control will be achieved using regular insulin sliding scale. The patient's lines, including the PICC line and arterial line, will be removed and cultured. A new femoral line will be placed.

Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not recommended due to the patient"

   - Surgery: Gtube working fine, they are signing off
   - Cards: Last night he was in Atach with 2:1 block. The triplet rhythm
   was AFib which he has been in since his operation.--> NEEDS COUMADIN,
   once stabilized. Restart and uptitrate Bblocker once no longer pressor
   dependent. Check EKG to confirm sinus rhythm (done and in sinus). If
   sinus, start Amiodarone 400mg PO/NG tid x7days, then 200mg PO/NG daily.
   Stop Digoxin once the 200mg daily Amio is started.
   - EKG with regular QRS's but hard to see P waves. Turned up gain to 20
   and P waves easier to see, and was IN SINUS
   - Carotid u/s clean <40% bilaterally (wet read --> need to f/u)
   - RUQ u/s: no read yet
   - Heme recs: Would start argatroban at a lower rate of 0.5 mcg/kg/min,
   and titrate to a PTT of 60-80.
   -Check PTT 2 hours after initiation of Argatroban, with the
   following protocol:
     If PTT < 40 sec increase by 0.5 mcg/kg/min
     If PTT 40
 59 sec increase by 0.25 mcg/kg/min
     If PTT 60
 80 sec No change
     If PTT 80
 100 sec HOLD for 1 hour and decrease by 0.25
   mcg/kg/min
     If PTT > 100 sec HOLD for 1 hour and decrease by 0.5 mcg/kg/min
   -Would start Coumadin when PTT is in the desired range at 2.5 mg
   PO per day.
   -Would avoid ALL heparin products, including flushes and SC
   injections.
   - Levo off at 10pm, pressures looking good. Vaso stopped 11p.
   A month ago long discussion about failing to wean.  A lot of gut
   dismotility.  Significant renal insufficiency from lasix in attempts to
   pull off fluids.  He has chronic pleural effusions and initially was
   tolerating 12 hour trach mask trials and has been regressing since
   then.  Belly issues started in early [**Month (only) **].  Had a paracentesis.
   One doctor thought he might have a malignant process causing the
   ascites.  Two weeks ago he got a KUB to see what was happening.  Having
   constant residuals and this caused concern for misplacement.  Replaced
   g-tube and reimaged (equivocal).  Three different conversations with
   radiologists who thought it was okay.  He was getting the gastroview
   back 3-4 days later.  Put in low intermittent suction and took this
   out.  Decompressed the stomach and made it softer.  Intermittent fevers
   throughout.  Treated for ESBL klebsiella in the blood and removed PICC
   line mid-[**Month (only) 1148**] and was treated with ten day course with dorbax and
   placed a new one.  Gut seemed to be getting worse.  Not even tolerating
   20 cc hour and he was started on TPN about a week ago.  Discrepency
   between PA and attending regarding medications.  Attending thought it
   was in place and restarted everything.  Then it was stopped on Monday.
   He had been on amiodarone on admission and this was stopped secondary
   to lung/liver issues.  Also stopped his coumadin and aspirin because he
   had guaiac positive stools and he was having persistent transfusion
   requirements for Hct < 23.  Now the bleeding has been stopped.  Now
   he's just on the IV digoxin and lopressor.  [**Last Name 2429**] problem with [**Name2 (NI) 494**]
   weaning was the pleural effusions.  Backed off on the lasix.  Abdominal
   girth started getting bigger.  Couldn't use lasix because of the
   kidneys.  The patient has said in [**Month (only) 1148**] that he would want to proceed
   until [**Month (only) 25**].  Daughter came in on the 9th and PA told her about the
   abdominal process.  We can leave you like this and do nothing or we can
   have you transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] rather than staying in the same place.
   He wasn't clear what he wanted to do at that time.  Patient agreed to
   transfer back to [**Hospital1 19**].

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   A 73 year old gentleman with signs of urosepsis in supraventricular
   tachycardia presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning.
   1. Arrhytmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus by last EKG's [**2121-11-28**]. Have
   consulted Cards who rec an Amiodarone load then maintenance, which the
   pt was on in the past and stopped due to liver/lung issues.
   - Dig level low will need to be increased, currently at 0.125mg every
   other day
   - Will start Amiodarone load then maintenance as outlined by cards
   - Will need to start discussing anticoagulation for h/o AFib, was
   previously on, but stopped due to guaic positive stools and persistent
   transfusion requirements
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Now currently off Levo and ADH
   - If heart rate increases, would control with Bblockade per Cards recs,
   as bp can tolerate
   - F/u with cards this morning
   - [**Hospital1 7**] cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat EKG this pm and would try using 20 on the gain to really see
   the P waves
   2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been weaned
   and appears hemodynamically fairly stable with some 80-90's bps that
   quickly resolve. Has not been tachycardic.
   - Watch hemodynamics through the day
   - Control tachycardia as above with BBlockade, as tolerated by bp
   - Vanc/Zosyn for GU and Pulm infectious sources
   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn
   3. H/o HIT with need to be anticoagulated
   - Would favor starting Argatroban, not urgent but need to consider
   given h/o Afib
   - F/u with heme, they have outlined their recs for starting Argatroban
   to Coumadin
   3. Trach/[**Hospital1 494**] dependence: Unclear history of trach collar vs.
   dependence on [**Hospital1 **].  Metabolic alkalosis and current alkalemia from
   over ventillation. RSBI this am 139.
   - Currently on CPAP 18/8, 40%
   - Continue with SBT's which apparently pt had been tolerating well a
   while ago, but then began regressing
   4. PNA: Health care vs. Ventilator associated PNA.
   - Vanc/Zosyn
   - Sputum culture
   5. Urosepsis:
   - F/U Urine culture
   - Vanc/Zosyn above
   6. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Likely pre-renal, not receiving as
   much nutrition at OSH. ATN vs. Pre-renal. FeNa yesterday was 0.5
   - Will give 500cc bolus today then recheck Cr later to see if improved.
   - renally dose meds
   7. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Improved this
   am but need to watch
   - Free water boluses via G tube 100mL q6
   - Meaure pm Na
   8. S/P CABG: Elevated troponins likely rate/renal function related.
   - Statin, ASA
   9. Depression:
   - Continue Paxil
   10. ""Funny Carotids"" No signs of stroke, neuro exam WNL.
   - F/u carotid dopplers

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with multiple medical complications. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was in supraventricular tachycardia on admission. He has been started on amiodarone for rhythm control, which he has previously taken but stopped due to liver/lung issues.

2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive with poor urine output, suggesting distributive shock from urosepsis or pneumonia. He has been treated with antibiotics and pressors, and now appears hemodynamically stable.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and his current renal function is compromised. He requires careful monitoring of fluid balance and medication dosing.

4. Tracheostomy dependence: The patient's dependence on the tracheostomy collar is unclear, and he may be regressing in tolerance for spontaneous breathing trials. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging.

5. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate antibiotic therapy and sputum culture are necessary.

6. Urosepsis: The patient shows signs of urinary tract infection (UTI) leading to sepsis. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is warranted.

7. Hypernatremia: The patient has"

   - Levo off at 10pm, pressures looking good. Vaso stopped 11p.
   A month ago long discussion about failing to wean.  A lot of gut
   dismotility.  Significant renal insufficiency from lasix in attempts to
   pull off fluids.  He has chronic pleural effusions and initially was
   tolerating 12 hour trach mask trials and has been regressing since
   then.  Belly issues started in early [**Month (only) **].  Had a paracentesis.
   One doctor thought he might have a malignant process causing the
   ascites.  Two weeks ago he got a KUB to see what was happening.  Having
   constant residuals and this caused concern for misplacement.  Replaced
   g-tube and reimaged (equivocal).  Three different conversations with
   radiologists who thought it was okay.  He was getting the gastroview
   back 3-4 days later.  Put in low intermittent suction and took this
   out.  Decompressed the stomach and made it softer.  Intermittent fevers
   throughout.  Treated for ESBL klebsiella in the blood and removed PICC
   line mid-[**Month (only) 1148**] and was treated with ten day course with dorbax and
   placed a new one.  Gut seemed to be getting worse.  Not even tolerating
   20 cc hour and he was started on TPN about a week ago.  Discrepency
   between PA and attending regarding medications.  Attending thought it
   was in place and restarted everything.  Then it was stopped on Monday.
   He had been on amiodarone on admission and this was stopped secondary
   to lung/liver issues.  Also stopped his coumadin and aspirin because he
   had guaiac positive stools and he was having persistent transfusion
   requirements for Hct < 23.  Now the bleeding has been stopped.  Now
   he's just on the IV digoxin and lopressor.  [**Last Name 2429**] problem with [**Name2 (NI) 494**]
   weaning was the pleural effusions.  Backed off on the lasix.  Abdominal
   girth started getting bigger.  Couldn't use lasix because of the
   kidneys.  The patient has said in [**Month (only) 1148**] that he would want to proceed
   until [**Month (only) 25**].  Daughter came in on the 9th and PA told her about the
   abdominal process.  We can leave you like this and do nothing or we can
   have you transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] rather than staying in the same place.
   He wasn't clear what he wanted to do at that time.  Patient agreed to
   transfer back to [**Hospital1 19**].

 would ask Cards about this
   - Will NOT start Amiodarone load then maintenance as outlined by cards
   because pt was on it before and had complications with liver/lung
   will touch base with Cards about this and let them know
   - Will need to start discussing anticoagulation for h/o AFib, was
   previously on, but stopped due to guaic positive stools and persistent
   transfusion requirements
 will NOT anticoagulate this pt for those
   exact reasons
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Now currently off Levo and ADH
   - If heart rate increases, would control with Bblockade per Cards recs,
   as bp can tolerate
   - F/u with cards this morning

   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been weaned
   and appears hemodynamically fairly stable with some 80-90's bps that

   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn
   3. H/o HIT with need to be anticoagulated
   - F/u with heme, they have outlined their recs for starting Argatroban

1. Arrhythmia: The patient was initially in atrial fibrillation (AFib) and then converted to sinus rhythm. The attending physician has consulted cardiology and plans to restart amiodarone due to previous complications with liver/lung issues.

2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive with poor urine output, which was treated as distributive shock from urosepsis or pneumonia. The patient has been stabilized with the use of pressors and appears hemodynamically stable.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely pre-renal in origin. The attending physician is monitoring the patient's condition and plans to adjust fluid intake and medication dosages accordingly.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has signs of impaired skin integrity, which requires close monitoring for potential pressure ulcers or infections.

5. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have urosepsis, possibly caused by a urinary tract infection. The attending physician has started broad-spectrum antibiotics and plans to continue monitoring and treating the infection.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and the attending physician is working on weaning the patient off mechanical ventilation. The patient's tracheostomy tube is functioning properly.

   - Cards: Last night he was in Atach with 2:1 block. The triplet rhythm
   was AFib which he has been in since his operation.--> NEEDS COUMADIN,
   once stabilized. Restart and uptitrate Bblocker once no longer pressor
   dependent. Check EKG to confirm sinus rhythm (done and in sinus). If
   sinus, start Amiodarone 400mg PO/NG tid x7days, then 200mg PO/NG daily.
   Stop Digoxin once the 200mg daily Amio is started.
   - EKG with regular QRS's but hard to see P waves. Turned up gain to 20

   - Levo off at 10pm, pressures looking good. Vaso stopped 11p.
   A month ago long discussion about failing to wean.  A lot of gut
   dismotility.  Significant renal insufficiency from lasix in attempts to
   pull off fluids.  He has chronic pleural effusions and initially was
   tolerating 12 hour trach mask trials and has been regressing since
   then.  Belly issues started in early [**Month (only) **].  Had a paracentesis.
   One doctor thought he might have a malignant process causing the
   ascites.  Two weeks ago he got a KUB to see what was happening.  Having
   constant residuals and this caused concern for misplacement.  Replaced
   g-tube and reimaged (equivocal).  Three different conversations with
   radiologists who thought it was okay.  He was getting the gastroview
   back 3-4 days later.  Put in low intermittent suction and took this
   out.  Decompressed the stomach and made it softer.  Intermittent fevers
   throughout.  Treated for ESBL klebsiella in the blood and removed PICC
   line mid-[**Month (only) 1148**] and was treated with ten day course with dorbax and
   placed a new one.  Gut seemed to be getting worse.  Not even tolerating
   20 cc hour and he was started on TPN about a week ago.  Discrepency
   between PA and attending regarding medications.  Attending thought it
   was in place and restarted everything.  Then it was stopped on Monday.
   He had been on amiodarone on admission and this was stopped secondary
   to lung/liver issues.  Also stopped his coumadin and aspirin because he
   had guaiac positive stools and he was having persistent transfusion
   requirements for Hct < 23.  Now the bleeding has been stopped.  Now
   he's just on the IV digoxin and lopressor.  [**Last Name 2429**] problem with [**Name2 (NI) 494**]
   weaning was the pleural effusions.  Backed off on the lasix.  Abdominal
   girth started getting bigger.  Couldn't use lasix because of the
   kidneys.  The patient has said in [**Month (only) 1148**] that he would want to proceed
   until [**Month (only) 25**].  Daughter came in on the 9th and PA told her about the
   abdominal process.  We can leave you like this and do nothing or we can
   have you transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] rather than staying in the same place.
   He wasn't clear what he wanted to do at that time.  Patient agreed to
   transfer back to [**Hospital1 19**].

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   A 73 year old gentleman with signs of urosepsis in supraventricular
   tachycardia presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning.
   1. Arrhytmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus by last EKG's [**2121-11-28**]. Have
   consulted Cards who rec an Amiodarone load then maintenance, which the
   pt was on in the past and stopped due to liver/lung issues.
   - Dig level low will need to be increased, currently at 0.125mg every
   other day
 would ask Cards about this
   - Will NOT start Amiodarone load then maintenance as outlined by cards
   because pt was on it before and had complications with liver/lung
   will touch base with Cards about this and let them know
   - Will need to start discussing anticoagulation for h/o AFib, was
   previously on, but stopped due to guaic positive stools and persistent
   transfusion requirements
 will NOT anticoagulate this pt for those
   exact reasons
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Now currently off Levo and ADH
   - If heart rate increases, would control with Bblockade per Cards recs,
   as bp can tolerate
   - F/u with cards this morning
   - Repeat EKG this pm and would try using 20 on the gain to really see
   the P waves
   2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been weaned
   and appears hemodynamically fairly stable with some 80-90's bps that
   quickly resolve. Has not been tachycardic.
   - Watch hemodynamics through the day
   - Control tachycardia as above with BBlockade, as tolerated by bp
   - Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro for GU and Pulm infectious sources
   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn
   3. H/o HIT with need to be anticoagulated
   - F/u with heme, they have outlined their recs for starting Argatroban
   to Coumadin
   - We will touch base with heme as well and let them know we will NOT be
   starting the anticoagulation due to h/o slow chronic bleed requiring
   frequent transfusions.
   3. Trach/[**Month/Day/Year 494**] dependence: Unclear history of trach collar vs.
   dependence on [**Month/Day/Year **].  Metabolic alkalosis and current alkalemia from
   over ventillation. RSBI this am 139.
   - Currently on CPAP 18/8, 40%
   - Continue with SBT's which apparently pt had been tolerating well a
   while ago, but then began regressing
   4. PNA: Health care vs. Ventilator associated PNA.
   - Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro
   - Sputum culture
   5. Urosepsis:
   - F/U Urine culture
   - ABx as above
   6. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Likely pre-renal, not receiving as
   much nutrition at OSH. ATN vs. Pre-renal. FeNa yesterday was 0.5
   - Cr is chronically elevated, but will continue to trend.
   - Hold off on fluids for now
   - renally dose meds
   7. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Improved this
   am but need to watch
   - Free water boluses via G tube 100mL q6
   - Meaure pm Na
   8. S/P CABG: Elevated troponins likely rate/renal function related.
   - Statin, ASA
   9. Depression:
   - Continue Paxil
   10. ""Funny Carotids"" No signs of stroke, neuro exam WNL.
   - F/u carotid dopplers, wet read normal
   11. DM: ISS, no standing for now
   12. G-tube malfunction: functioning per surgery, Radiology and nursing.
   Surgery has signed off.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of urosepsis, respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and depression. He was admitted with signs of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, but is now in sinus rhythm. The patient has been on multiple medications including amiodarone, digoxin, and beta-blockers.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypernatremia, elevated troponin levels, and acute on chronic renal failure. He has a history of HIT and requires anticoagulation but has not been given any due to concerns about chronic bleeding. The patient's tracheostomy tube has been in place for an unknown duration, and there is a question about whether he is dependent on it or not.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and depression. He is currently on a feeding tube and receiving various prophylactic medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was in supraventricular tachycardia upon admission. He is currently in sinus rhythm but may require ongoing cardiac monitoring and management.
2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive and required pressors. His hemodynamics are currently stable, but ongoing monitoring is necessary.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and his renal function needs to be closely monitored.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires careful management with free water boluses.
5. Urosepsis: The patient has signs of urosepsis, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
6. Tracheostomy Dependence: The duration of the tracheostomy tube placement is unclear, and it is uncertain whether the patient is dependent on it or not. Tracheostomy dependence may complicate weaning from mechanical ventilation.
7. Pneumonia: The patient may have healthcare-associated pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia, and appropriate antibiotic coverage should be maintained.
8. Cirrhosis: The patient has newly discovered cirrhosis, and further evaluation is needed with a hepatology consult.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, which requires ongoing management and consideration of the underlying causes.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information from the patient's medical history and physical examination may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 73 year old gentleman with signs of urosepsis in supraventricular
   tachycardia presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning.
   1. Arrhytmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus by last EKG's [**2121-11-28**]. Have
   consulted Cards who rec an Amiodarone load then maintenance, which the
   pt was on in the past and stopped due to liver/lung issues.
   - Dig level low will need to be increased, currently at 0.125mg every
   other day
 cards recommends stopping dig one week after amiodarone
   - Will NOT start Amiodarone load then maintenance as outlined by cards
   because pt was on it before and had complications with liver/lung
   complications
 will touch base with Cards about this and let them know
   - Will need to start discussing anticoagulation for h/o AFib, was
   previously on, but stopped due to guaic positive stools and persistent
   transfusion requirements
 will NOT anticoagulate this pt for those
   exact reasons
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Now currently off Levo and ADH
   - If heart rate increases, would control with Bblockade per Cards recs,
   as bp can tolerate
   - F/u with cards this morning
   - Repeat EKG today to assure in sinus rhythm
   .
   2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been
   weaned.
   - Watch hemodynamics through the day
   - Control tachycardia as above with BBlockade, as tolerated by bp
   - Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro for GU and Pulm infectious sources
   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn
   .
   3. H/o HIT with need to be anticoagulated
   - F/u with heme, they have outlined their recs for starting Argatroban
   to Coumadin
   - We will touch base with heme as well and let them know we will NOT be
   starting the anticoagulation due to h/o slow chronic bleed requiring
   frequent transfusions.
   .
   3. Persistent respiratory failure: Unclear history of trach collar vs.
   dependence on Vent.  SBT trial this morning.  Plan to wean to trach
   mask. Could also have component of weakness, infection; echo findings
   new versus prior (borderline function of RV), unable to anticoagulate
   d/t persistent GI bleed
   .
    4. PNA: Health care vs. Ventilator associated PNA.
   - Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro
   - Sputum culture
   .
   5. Urosepsis: <10,000 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] unlikely UTI
   - F/U Urine culture
   - ABx as above
   6. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Likely pre-renal, not receiving as
   much nutrition at OSH. ATN vs. Pre-renal. FeNa yesterday was 0.5
   - Cr is chronically elevated, but will continue to trend.  Is 2.8 this
   morning, was 2.6 yesterday
   - Give fluid boluses today as took off a lot of fluid yesterday
   - renally dose meds
   .
   7. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147
   - Increase free water boluses via G tube to 200mL q6
   - Meaure pm Na
   .
   8. Liver failure: Patient was found to have cirrhosis and ascites on
   imaging.  He had a paracentesis yest and 9L was removed.  This has been
   sent for culture data and has been NTD.  Hepatology involved.
   -Hepatology recs:
   ----- Hep serologies; immunoglobulins; [**Last Name (un) 4195**]; ferritin, iron, TIBC
   ----- Careful EtOH hx.
   ------ Review of records regardin cardio-pulmonary issues given no
   ascites before surgery
   9. Agitation / delirium: started seroquel yesterday and tolerated will
   -increase dose of seroquel today if neded.
   .
   10. S/P CABG: Elevated troponins likely rate/renal function related.
   - Statin, ASA
   .
   11. Depression:
   - Continue Paxil
   .
   12. ""Funny Carotids"" No signs of stroke, neuro exam WNL.
   - F/u carotid dopplers, wet read normal
   .
   13. DM: ISS, no standing for now
   .
   14. G-tube malfunction: functioning per surgery, Radiology and nursing.
   Surgery has signed off.
   .
   FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Boots, PPI, Bowel reg
   Access: L PIV. L subclavian triple lumen. R AC PICC and R femoral have
   been pulled
   Code:  DNR, already tracheally intubated.
   Communication: Patient, daughter [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11465**] (home); cell:
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11466**]
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications that require attention. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Arrhythmia: The patient was initially in atrial fibrillation and tachycardia but was given adenosine and a beta-blocker, resulting in sinus rhythm. The patient's history of amiodarone use in the past with associated liver and lung complications makes it necessary to avoid restarting amiodarone. There is a need to control the heart rate with beta-blockade as per cardiology recommendations.

2. Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension and poor urine output upon admission, suspected to be distributive shock from urosepsis or pneumonia. Antibiotics were started, and the patient was placed on pressors which have now been weaned off. Close monitoring of hemodynamics is required throughout the day.

3. History of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia): The patient has a history of HIT and needs to be anticoagulated. However, due to the patient's slow chronic bleed requiring frequent transfusions, anticoagulation will not be initiated.

4. Persistent respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unclear, with uncertainty regarding tracheostomy dependence versus ventilator dependence. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be conducted this morning. Weaning to a tracheostomy mask is planned. There may be components of weakness, infection, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 73 year old gentleman with signs of urosepsis in supraventricular
   tachycardia presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning.
   1. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus by last EKG's [**2121-11-28**]. Have
   consulted Cards who rec an Amiodarone load then maintenance, which the
   pt was on in the past and stopped due to liver/lung issues.
   - Dig level low will need to be increased, currently at 0.125mg every
   other day and will dose at q day
 cards recommends stopping dig one
   week after amiodarone, but d/t amiodarone reaction we will not start
   this.
   - Will NOT start Amiodarone load then maintenance as outlined by cards
   because pt was on it before and had liver/lung complications
 will
   touch base with Cards about this and let them know
   - Will need to start discussing anticoagulation for h/o AFib, was
   previously on, but stopped due to guaiac positive stools and persistent
   transfusion requirements
 will NOT anticoagulate this pt for those
   exact reasons
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Now currently off Levo and ADH
   - If heart rate increases, would control with Bblockade per Cards recs,
   as bp can tolerate
   - F/u with cards this morning
   - Repeat EKG today to assure in sinus rhythm
   .
   2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been

   Assessment and Plan
   A 73 year old gentleman with signs of urosepsis in supraventricular
   tachycardia presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning.
   1. Arrhytmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus by last EKG's [**2121-11-28**]. Have
   consulted Cards who rec an Amiodarone load then maintenance, which the
   pt was on in the past and stopped due to liver/lung issues.
   - Dig level low will need to be increased, currently at 0.125mg every
   other day and will dose at q day
 cards recommends stopping dig one
   week after amiodarone
   - Will NOT start Amiodarone load then maintenance as outlined by cards
   because pt was on it before and had complications with liver/lung
   complications
 will touch base with Cards about this and let them know
   - Will need to start discussing anticoagulation for h/o AFib, was
   previously on, but stopped due to guaic positive stools and persistent
   transfusion requirements
 will NOT anticoagulate this pt for those
   exact reasons
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Now currently off Levo and ADH
   - If heart rate increases, would control with Bblockade per Cards recs,
   as bp can tolerate
   - F/u with cards this morning
   - Repeat EKG today to assure in sinus rhythm
   .
   2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been
   weaned.
   - Watch hemodynamics through the day
   - Control tachycardia as above with BBlockade, as tolerated by bp
   - Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro for GU and Pulm infectious sources
   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn
   .
   3. H/o HIT with need to be anticoagulated
   - F/u with heme, they have outlined their recs for starting Argatroban
   to Coumadin
   - We will touch base with heme as well and let them know we will NOT be
   starting the anticoagulation due to h/o slow chronic bleed requiring
   frequent transfusions.
   .
   3. Persistent respiratory failure: Unclear history of trach collar vs.
   dependence on Vent.  SBT trial this morning.  Plan to wean to trach
   mask. Could also have component of weakness, infection; echo findings
   new versus prior (borderline function of RV), unable to anticoagulate
   d/t persistent GI bleed
   .
    4. PNA: Health care vs. Ventilator associated PNA.
   - Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro
   - Sputum culture
   .
   5. Urosepsis: <10,000 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] unlikely UTI
   - F/U Urine culture
   - ABx as above
   6. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Likely pre-renal, not receiving as
   much nutrition at OSH. ATN vs. Pre-renal. FeNa yesterday was 0.5
   - Cr is chronically elevated, but will continue to trend.  Is 2.8 this
   morning, was 2.6 yesterday
   - Give fluid boluses today as took off a lot of fluid yesterday
   - renally dose meds
   .
   7. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147
   - Increase free water boluses via G tube to 200mL q6
   - Meaure pm Na
   .
   8. Liver failure: Patient was found to have cirrhosis and ascites on
   imaging.  He had a paracentesis yest and 9L was removed.  This has been
   sent for culture data and has been NTD.  Hepatology involved.
   -Hepatology recs:
   ----- Hep serologies; immunoglobulins; [**Last Name (un) 4195**]; ferritin, iron, TIBC
   ----- Careful EtOH hx.
   ------ Review of records regardin cardio-pulmonary issues given no
   ascites before surgery
   9. Agitation / delirium: started seroquel yesterday and tolerated will
   -increase dose of seroquel today if neded.
   .
   10. S/P CABG: Elevated troponins likely rate/renal function related.
   - Statin, ASA
   .
   11. Depression:
   - Continue Paxil
   .
   12. ""Funny Carotids"" No signs of stroke, neuro exam WNL.
   - F/u carotid dopplers, wet read normal
   .
   13. DM: ISS, no standing for now
   .
   14. G-tube malfunction: functioning per surgery, Radiology and nursing.
   Surgery has signed off.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical complications, including supraventricular tachycardia, pseudomonas pneumonia, urinary tract infection, liver failure, and acute kidney injury. The patient underwent a paracentesis yesterday and had 9 liters of ascitic fluid removed. The cultures from the ascitic fluid are negative. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was previously on amiodarone, but it was stopped due to liver and lung complications. The patient's heart rate is currently controlled with beta-blockers. The patient also has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and requires anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation but cannot be anticoagulated due to a history of chronic bleeding requiring frequent transfusions. The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is dependent on the ventilator. The patient's sodium levels are high, indicating hypovolemic hypernatremia. The patient has liver failure with cirrhosis and ascites and is awaiting further hepatology recommendations. The patient is also experiencing agitation and delirium and is being treated with seroquel. The patient had a recent CABG surgery and elevated troponin levels, which may be related to the rate or renal function. The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with paxil. There are no signs of stroke, and the neuro exam is normal. The patient has diabetes and is"

   A 73 year old gentleman with signs of urosepsis in supraventricular
   tachycardia presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning. His urine has grown out <[**2112**] [**Year (4 digits) **]
s, unlikely a
   true infection, but he also has sputum with Pseudomonas, currently
   being treated.
   1. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus. Have consulted Cards who rec an
   Amiodarone load then maintenance, which the pt was on in the past and
   stopped due to liver/lung issues.
   - Dig level is not elevated, will continue dosage as is.
   - Cards rec'd starting Amiodarone but will need to touch base with them
   to let them know we will NOT start this due to lung/liver problems in
   the past
   - Will start Bblocker for increased bp
   - F/u with cards this morning
   2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been
   weaned.
   - Watch hemodynamics through the day
   - Control tachycardia as above with BBlockade, as tolerated by bp
   - [**Year (4 digits) 11557**]/Cipro for GU ([**Year (4 digits) **]) and Pulm (pseudomonas) infectious sources
   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn
   3. H/o HIT with need to be anticoagulated
   - Started on Argatroban gtt for PE prophylaxis per Heme recs
   - LENI's negative
   4. Persistent respiratory failure: Reportedly on vent for the last 6
   mos.  Failure to wean could be both pneumonia as well as component of
   weakness, echo findings of RV dysfunction suggesting possible PE
   (unable to anticoagulate d/t persistent GI bleed)
   - ABG looked good this morning, will continue to try to wean CPAP as
   tolerated
   - Repeat SBT today
   5. Fluid status: Was fluid up yesterday and is 5L positive through LOS,
   will start diuresis today with Lasix gtt, with goal 100-150cc/hr, goal
   1-2L / day.
   - PM lytes
   6. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to [**Year (4 digits) 11557**], but resistant
   to Cipro
   - [**Year (4 digits) 11557**]/Cipro
 will need to switch cipro or possibly do single
   coverage with [**Last Name (LF) 11557**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] d/w team
   - Sputum culture
   - Daily CXR
   7. Urosepsis: <10,000 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] unlikely UTI
   - F/U Urine culture
   - ABx as above
   8. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Likely pre-renal, not receiving as
   much nutrition at OSH. ATN vs. Pre-renal. FeNa yesterday was 0.5
   - Cr is chronically elevated, but will continue to trend.  Is 2.7 this
   morning, was 2.7 yesterday
   - renally dose meds
   - Watch UOP through today
   9. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147
   - Increase free water boluses via G tube to 200mL q6
   - Measure pm Na
   10. Liver failure: Patient was found to have cirrhosis and ascites on
   imaging.  He had a paracentesis a couple days ago and 9L was removed.
   This has been sent for culture data and has been NTD.  Hepatology
   involved.
   - F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune panels
   - Hepatology recs:
   - Review of records regarding cardio-pulmonary issues given no ascites
   before surgery
   - Consider repeat Dx paracentesis to evaluate resolution
   - F/u Cx
s from para fluid
   9. Agitation / delirium: started seroquel yesterday and tolerated
   -increase dose of seroquel today if needed.
   10. S/P CABG: Elevated troponins likely rate/renal function related.
   - ASA
   - Statin has been d/c
   11. Depression:
   - Continue Paxil
   12. ""Funny Carotids"" No signs of stroke, neuro exam WNL.
   - carotid dopplers with <40% stenosis
   13. DM: ISS, no standing for now
   14. G-tube malfunction: functioning per surgery, Radiology and nursing.
   Surgery has signed off.
   FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Boots, PPI, Bowel reg
   Access: L PIV. L subclavian triple lumen.
   Code:  DNR, already tracheally intubated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with multiple medical complications. The note details his current health status, including his cardiac condition, respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis, impaired skin integrity, and depression.

The patient's cardiac condition includes atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and a history of tachycardia. He was given adenosine and a beta-blocker to manage his heart rate, but it was successfully converted to sinus rhythm. The cardiology department recommended starting amiodarone, which was previously used by the patient but had to be stopped due to liver and lung issues. The patient's blood pressure is also being monitored and managed with medication.

The patient's respiratory failure is chronic, with ongoing ventilator dependence. He has been on the ventilator for the past six months, and there are concerns about pneumonia and right ventricular dysfunction suggesting possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The medical team is trying to wean him off CPAP as tolerated and will repeat a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today.

The patient has fluid overload, with a positive fluid balance of 5 liters since admission. Diuretics have been started to manage this issue, aiming for a urine output of 100-150 cc/hr and a daily fluid intake of 1-2 liters.

The patient has a pseudomonas infection in his sputum, which is sensitive to cefepime but resistant to ciprof"

   - Dig level low will need to be increased, currently at 0.125mg every
   other day and will dose at q day.
   - Cards rec'd starting Amiodarone but will need to touch base with them
   to let them know we will NOT start this due to lung/liver problems in
   the past
   - We will also NOT start anti-coagulation due to slow bleed at OSH
   requiring transfusions every so often, need to touch base with Heme and
   let them know this
   - Replete electrolytes
   - If heart rate increases, would control with Bblockade per Cards recs,
   as bp can tolerate
   - F/u with cards this morning

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with multiple medical complications. The note highlights several potential medical complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient was in supraventricular tachycardia upon admission and received adenosine and beta-blocker treatment. Currently, the patient is in sinus rhythm. The cardiology team recommended starting amiodarone, but this has been declined due to past liver and lung issues. The digoxin level is low and needs to be increased.

2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive with poor urine output and was treated with antibiotics and vasopressors. The patient's hemodynamics should be monitored throughout the day.

3. History of HIT (Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia): The patient requires anticoagulation but cannot receive heparin due to HIT. Argatroban has been started for pulmonary embolism prophylaxis.

4. Persistent respiratory failure: The patient has been on the ventilator for six months, and weaning attempts have been unsuccessful. Possible causes include pneumonia and right ventricular dysfunction suggesting a pulmonary embolism.

5. Pseudomonas pneumonia: Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cultured from the sputum. Cefepime/Ciprofloxacin has been prescribed for treatment.

6. Urosepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by <"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, ascites, depression, and a recent CABG surgery. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension. The patient has pseudomonas infection in his sputum and urine, but the urine culture is unlikely to be a true infection. He is on multiple medications and has several ongoing issues that require management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was given adenosine and a beta-blocker on admission. The cardiology team recommended starting amiodarone, but it may not be suitable due to the patient's past liver and lung problems.
2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on admission and is suspected to have distributive shock from urosepsis or pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started, and vasopressors have been weaned.
3. H/o HIT: The patient has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and needs to be anticoagulated. Argatroban is being used for PE prophylaxis.
4. Persistent respiratory failure: The patient has been on a ventilator for six months, and weaning has been unsuccessful. Pneumonia and right ventricular dysfunction are contributing factors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of cardiac surgery who is currently in the ICU for persistent respiratory failure. He presented with septic shock, which has improved under treatment. The sources of sepsis appear to be pneumonia and a urinary tract infection. The patient is now on cefepime and ciprofloxacin pending sensitivity results.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) - The patient has AFIB, but no specific treatment plan is mentioned.
2. Ascites - The patient has ascites, and etiologic evaluation is underway. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is being treated.
3. Depression - The patient has depression, but no specific treatment plan is mentioned.
4. Tachycardia, other - The patient has an atrial tachycardia, which is being treated with digoxin. Beta blockade will be added.
5. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF) - The patient has acute renal failure, and ongoing management is required.
6. Impaired skin integrity - The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to immobility or pressure ulcers.
7. Sepsis without organ dysfunction - The patient had sepsis, but it has improved under treatment.
8. Respiratory failure, chronic - The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and aggressive diuretic therapy with Lasix will be initiated to aim for a negative fluid"

   A 73 year old gentleman with signs of urosepsis in supraventricular
   tachycardia presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning and is no longer an active issue. His urine has
   grown out <[**2112**] GNR
s, so unlikely a true infection, but he also has
   sputum with Pseudomonas, currently being treated, which likely is a
   true infection. In his workup at this hospital it was learned that he
   has a cirrhotic liver, of unknown etiology, and had significant ascites
   that has been 9L tapped. Current active issues are the
   etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis, managing the
   arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in sinus),
   managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy), and
   managing his trach/vent dependence.
   1. Liver failure: Patient was found to have cirrhosis and ascites on
   imaging.  He had a paracentesis a couple days ago and 9L was removed.
   This has been sent for culture data and has been NTD.  Hepatology
   involved. Now seen to have positive [**Doctor First Name **], positive anti-smooth muscle Ab
   and elevated IgG, consistent with autoimmune hepatitis etiology, but
   will f/u with Hepatology about this and how significant this is.
   - F/u with Hepatology today
   - Consider repeat Dx paracentesis to evaluate resolution, as we were
   unable to do this yesterday
   - Cx's from fluid have been negative for infection
   - Invite Hepatology to family meeting tomorrow at Wednesday 2pm
   2. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus. Have consulted Cards who rec an
   Amiodarone load then maintenance, which the pt was on in the past and
   stopped due to liver/lung issues. We have elected not to restart the
   Amiodarone due to this history of issues, but have started him on Dig
   instead.
   - Dig level is not elevated, will continue dosage as is.
   - Started on Bblocker [**12-1**] and bp and pressures mostly in the 130's -
   160's
   - Keep an eye on telemetry, go up on Bblocker as needed, currently at
   25 PO bid
   3. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt was on Cefepime/[**Name (NI) **], but yesterday d/c'd [**Name (NI) **]
   - Today is day 5 of Cefepime
   4. Persistent respiratory failure: Reportedly on vent for the last 6
   mos.  Failure to wean could be both pneumonia as well as component of
   weakness, echo findings of RV dysfunction suggesting possible PE
   (unable to anticoagulate d/t persistent GI bleed), or persistent
   pleural effusions due to persistent ascites
   - ABG looked good this morning, will continue to try to wean CPAP as
   tolerated
   - Getting an SBT this morning
   5. H/o HIT with need to be anticoagulated. LENI's are negative
   - Started on Argatroban gtt for PE prophylaxis per Heme recs with goal
   PTT 40-60
   6. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been weaned.
   No longer an active issue
   - Watch hemodynamics through the day
   - Control tachycardia as above with BBlockade, as tolerated by bp
   - Cefipime for Pulm (pseudomonas) infectious sources
   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn
   7. Fluid status: Was fluid up yesterday and is 5L positive through LOS,
   will start diuresis today with Lasix gtt, with goal 100-150cc/hr, goal
   1-2L / day.
   - Was approximately even yesterday
   - Yesterday went up to 12mg/hr Lasix gtt
   - F/u UOP later and may have to increase.
   8. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Likely pre-renal, not receiving as
   much nutrition at OSH. ATN vs. Pre-renal. FeNa in earlier in the
   admission was 0.5
   - Cr is chronically elevated, but will continue to trend.  Is 2.5 this
   morning, was 2.7 yesterday
   - Cr is likely back within baseline levels now
   - renally dose meds
   - Watch UOP through today
   9. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147
   - Have increased free water boluses via G tube to 250cc q4
   - Measure pm Na
   10. Agitation / delirium: Have started seroquel and appears to be well
   tolerating
   -increase dose of seroquel today if needed.
   11. S/P CABG: Elevated troponins likely rate/renal function related.
   - ASA
   - Statin has been d/c
   12. Depression:
   - Continue Paxil
   13. ""Funny Carotids"" No signs of stroke, neuro exam WNL. Not an active
   issue.
   - carotid dopplers with <40% stenosis
   - not active issue
   14. DM: ISS, no standing for now
   15. G-tube malfunction: functioning per surgery, Radiology and nursing.
   Surgery has signed off. Not an active issue

   A 73 year old gentleman with signs of urosepsis in supraventricular
   tachycardia presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning and is no longer an active issue. His urine has
   grown out <[**2112**] GNR
s, so unlikely a true infection, but he also has
   sputum with Pseudomonas, currently being treated, which likely is a
   true infection. In his workup at this hospital it was learned that he
   has a cirrhotic liver, of unknown etiology, and had significant ascites
   that has been 9L tapped. Current active issues are the
   etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis, managing the
   arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in sinus),
   managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy), and
   managing his trach/vent dependence.
   1. Liver failure: Patient was found to have cirrhosis and ascites on
   imaging.  He had a paracentesis a couple days ago and 9L was removed.
   This has been sent for culture data and has been NTD.  Hepatology
   involved. Now seen to have positive [**Doctor First Name **], positive anti-smooth muscle Ab
   and elevated IgG, consistent with autoimmune hepatitis etiology, but
   will f/u with Hepatology about this and how significant this is.
   - F/u with Hepatology today
   - Consider repeat Dx paracentesis to evaluate resolution, as we were
   unable to do this yesterday
 will need albumin today after para
   - Cx's from fluid have been negative for infection
   - Invite Hepatology to family meeting tomorrow at Wednesday 2pm
   2. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus. Have consulted Cards who rec an
   Amiodarone load then maintenance, which the pt was on in the past and
   stopped due to liver/lung issues. We have elected not to restart the
   Amiodarone due to this history of issues, but have started him on Dig
   instead.
   - Dig level is not elevated, will continue dosage as is.
   - Started on Bblocker [**12-1**] and bp and pressures mostly in the 130's -
   160's
   - Keep an eye on telemetry, go up on Bblocker as needed, currently at
   25 PO bid
   3. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt was on Cefepime/[**Name (NI) **], but yesterday d/c'd [**Name (NI) **]
   - Today is day 5 of Cefepime
   4. Persistent respiratory failure: Reportedly on vent for the last 6
   mos.  Failure to wean could be both pneumonia as well as component of
   weakness, echo findings of RV dysfunction suggesting possible PE
   (unable to anticoagulate d/t persistent GI bleed), or persistent
   pleural effusions due to persistent ascites
   - Doing well on SBT this am, may be able to get off vent today
   - ABG looked good this morning
   - Will get ABG and VGB today and see if they correlate well
   5. H/o HIT with need to be anticoagulated. LENI's are negative
   - Started on Argatroban gtt for PE prophylaxis per Heme recs with goal
   PTT 40-60
   6. CXR with concern for loculated effusion. Pt is now stable enough to
   get CT chest to further delineate, unthough unclear if pt would be
   amenable to drainage.
   7. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been weaned.
   No longer an active issue
   - Watch hemodynamics through the day
   - Control tachycardia as above with BBlockade, as tolerated by bp
   - Cefipime for Pulm (pseudomonas) infectious sources
   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn
   8. Fluid status: Was about fluid even yesterday and is still 5L
   positive through LOS, although this doesn
t count the 9L taken off
   during para. Started Lasix gtt yesterday with good UOP, but also
   getting free H2O flushes which contributes a fair amt of free water
   into his GI track. Will continue diuresis today with Lasix gtt, with
   goal 100-150cc/hr, goal 1-2L / day.
   - Was approximately even yesterday
   - Yesterday went up to 12mg/hr Lasix gtt
 will increase to 15mg/hr
   - F/u UOP later and may have to increase.
   9. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Likely a chronic renal insufficiency
   with Cr
s in the 2
s on admission. Lasix diuresis at OSH was also
   limited by renal failure. Of note, UA came back positive for urine
   eosinophils, concerning for acute interstitial nephritis.
   - Will get repeat UA, lytes, and urine eos to re-evaluate. If positive,
   would ask renal if they would treat for this AIN
   - Cr is chronically elevated, but will continue to trend.  Is 2.5 this
   morning, was 2.7 yesterday.
   - renally dose meds
   - Watch UOP through today
   10. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147
   - Have increased free water boluses via G tube to 250cc q4
   - Measure pm Na
   11. Agitation / delirium: Have started seroquel and appears to be well
   tolerating
   -increase dose of seroquel today if needed.
   12. S/P CABG: Elevated troponins likely rate/renal function related.
   - ASA
   - Statin has been d/c
   13. Depression:
   - Continue Paxil
   14. ""Funny Carotids"" No signs of stroke, neuro exam WNL. Not an active
   issue.
   - carotid dopplers with <40% stenosis
   - not active issue
   15. DM: ISS, no standing for now
   16. G-tube malfunction: functioning per surgery, Radiology and nursing.
   Surgery has signed off. Not an active issue

","The patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with signs of urosepsis in supraventricular tachycardia presenting for g-tube evaluation. He has a history of cirrhosis and ascites, as well as positive anti-smooth muscle Ab and elevated IgG, consistent with autoimmune hepatitis etiology. The patient is also being managed for atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs, and tracheostomy/ventilator dependence.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Liver failure: The patient has cirrhosis and ascites, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.

2. Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and there is a need to manage and monitor his heart rhythm.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has sputum with pansensitive pseudomonas, indicating a potential infection. This could lead to worsening respiratory failure or sepsis.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's prolonged immobility and bedridden state may increase the risk of pressure ulcers.

5. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and further deterioration may require dialysis.

6. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive on admission, and there is a need to monitor and manage his blood pressure.

   Assessment and Plan
   73-year-old man with persistent respiratory failure following cardiac
   surgery now returns with septic shock.  Shock has resolved under
   treatment.  Cirrhosis is a new finding, and evaluation suggests
   autoimmune hepatitis.  There is also some suggestion that acute renal
   failure could be related to AIN.
   Respiratory failure
   Now tolerating SBT.  Consider TC trial later.
   PMV trial today for communication.
   Diuresis with Lasix gtt goal -1000
 [**2112**] today, though free water may
   limit success in total nets.
   CT chest to exclude loculated effusion.
   Cirrhosis
   Appreciate hepatology
s help
   Etiologic evaluation underway.  Labs are concerning for autoimmune
   disease.
   Will discuss with hepatology regarding whether repeat paracentesis
   would be helpful.
   Acute renal failure
   Initially felt to be related to shock and possible UTI.
   However, pyuria and urine eosinophils raise the possibility of AIN.
   Repeat UA, lytes, and eos today.
   Sepsis
   Shock now resolved under treatment
   Sources appear to be pneumonia (Pseudomonal) and urine (GNR).
   On cefepime.
   CT chest to exclude complicated parapneumonic effusion.
   Atrial tachycardia
   On digoxin with good results so far.  No amiodarone given liver and
   lung issues.
   Add beta blockade.
   HIT
   On argatroban
   Lines
   PICC if feasible today.  Art line out today or tomorrow if ABG and VBG
   correlating.
   Goals of care
   Meeting scheduled for tomorrow with daughter (HCP) and (if possible)
   patient. Palliative care consulted. Currently DNR.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with persistent respiratory failure following cardiac surgery who has now returned with septic shock, which has resolved under treatment. The patient also has cirrhosis, a new finding, and evaluation suggests autoimmune hepatitis. There is some suggestion that acute renal failure could be related to AIN (Acute Interstitial Nephritis). 

The patient's respiratory failure is now tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and may consider tracheostomy (TC) trial later. A PMV (Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation) trial is planned for communication. Diuresis with Lasix is being given with a goal of -1000 mL today, though free water may limit success in total nets. A CT chest is ordered to exclude loculated effusion.

Regarding cirrhosis, the patient needs hepatology help and an etiologic evaluation is underway. Labs are concerning for autoimmune disease. Whether to repeat paracentesis would be helpful will be discussed with hepatology.

Acute renal failure is initially felt to be related to shock and possible UTI (Urinary Tract Infection), but pyuria and urine eosinophils raise the possibility of AIN. Repeat UA (Urine Analysis), lytes (Electrolytes), and eos are ordered today.

Sepsis and shock have resolved under treatment, with sources appearing to be pneumonia (Pseudomonal) and urine (GNR - Gram-Negative Rod). The patient"

   A 73 year old gentleman who presented with signs of urosepsis with
   atrial tachycardia/AFib presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube
   appears to be properly functioning and is no longer an active issue.
   His urine has grown out <[**2112**] GNR
s, so unlikely a true infection and
   no longer and active issue. He also has sputum with Pseudomonas,
   currently being treated, which likely is a true infection. In his
   workup at this hospital it was learned that he has a cirrhotic liver,
   with positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth muscle, and elevated IgG, and had
   significant ascites that has been 9L tapped, and now s/p a second tap
   to assess for resolution. Current active issues are the
   etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis, managing the
   arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in sinus),
   managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy), and
   managing his trach/vent dependence, Pseudomonas pneumonia, and now most
   currently, a positive UA with eosinophils and CT chest showing
   loculated effusions.
   1. Liver failure: Patient was found to have cirrhosis and ascites on
   imaging.  He had a paracentesis a couple days ago and 9L was removed
   and had a second [**Doctor First Name **] yesterday to assess for resolution, which showed
   less PMN's. Cx's from last [**Doctor First Name **] and Gstain from yesterday's [**Doctor First Name **] have
   been negative. Also with positive [**Doctor First Name **], positive anti-smooth muscle Ab
   and elevated IgG, consistent with autoimmune hepatitis etiology. Pt
   received some albumin with [**Doctor First Name **] yesterday.
   - F/u albumin this morning to calculate SAAG, but according to albumin
   from 4 days ago, would have SAAG <1.1 (0.5), differential including:
   peritonitis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, pancreatitis, vasculitides,
   hypoalbumin states, bowel obstruction, post-operative lymph leak
   note, pt received albumin yesterday after [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this mornings add-on
   albumin will reflect this and his calculated SAAG using this will not
   be correct.
   - Added on amylase and lipase to this am's labs
   - F/u Cx's from most recent [**First Name3 (LF) **] yesterday
   - F/u with Hepatology today
   - Invite Hepatology to family meeting tomorrow at Wednesday 2pm
   2. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus. Have consulted Cards who rec an
   Amiodarone load then maintenance, which the pt was on in the past and
   stopped due to liver/lung issues. We have elected not to restart the
   Amiodarone due to this history of issues, but have started him on Dig
   instead.
   - Dig level is not elevated, will continue dosage as is.
   - Will get Dig level tomorrow morning
   - Received some IV Labatelol yesterday
   3. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt was on Cefepime/[**Name (NI) **], but yesterday d/c'd [**Name (NI) **]
   - Today is day 6 of Cefepime of 15 day course
   4. Fluid status--CXR with mild-mod pulm edema yesterday
   - Currently on Lasix gtt, will continue, now at 15mg / hr with goals
   150 cc/hr and 1-2L off per day.
   - Still about 5L positive today through LOS, but this may not reflect
   the 9L taken off during first [**Name (NI) **].
   5. Positive UA--Yesterday. On admission, concern for urosepsis but UCx
   only grow out <[**2112**] GNR's. Now with UA conerning for infxn yesterday,
   and have sent off UCx this am. Having low grade 100 temps for a couple
   days. WBC's at 9
   - F/u UCx.
   - Continues on Cefepime.
   - Hold off on starting new ABx for now but will consider broadening if
   urine Cx grows out
   6. Loculated pleural effusions, R > L.
   - Unsure what to do with this result in face of overall goals of care.
   Will be addressed at family meeting today whether to be aggressive with
   this or not.
   - Will need f/u of final CT read
   - Consult IP about draining them today, and if we proceed, will need to
   have Argatroban stopped for procedure.
   7. UA with persistent eosinophils, concerning for acute interstitial
   nephritis, in setting of persistently elevated Cr. DDx includes
   allergic rxn to drugs, infxns including pyelonephritis, and
   infiltrative diseases like sarcoid, lymphoma, leukemia.
   - Renal consult this am about eosinophilia.
   - Consider CT abdomen to assess for pyelonephritis, although was not
   seen on last CT abdomen/pelvis done recently
   8. Drifting down Hct: Has been slowly going down through admission and
   likely a consequence of phlebotomizing with q4 coag checks due to
   argatroban. No obvious source of bleeding and no hemodynamic changes.
   Had iron studies this admission showing low level iron and labs
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Also, had hematuria on most
   recent UA, but urine is clear and blood loss in urine unlikely to be
   hemodynamically relevant, but will need to watch and consider if
   continued drop in Hct.
   - As PTT is stabilizing, can space q4 coags to q6 and if continued
   stable PTT, likely just [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guiac all stools
   - Watch vitals signs
   - Will get pm Hct
   - Has triple lumen subclavian and L PIV
   - Type and screen this morning, transfuse for <21
   9. Persistent respiratory failure: Reportedly on vent for the last 6
   mos.  Failure to wean could be both pneumonia as well as component of
   weakness, echo findings of RV dysfunction suggesting possible PE
   (unable to anticoagulate d/t persistent GI bleed) or pulmonary HTN, or
   persistent pleural effusions due to persistent ascites.
   - Had SBT yesterday but got tachy and sweaty after several hours so put
   back on PS 8/5
   - Had good RSBI this morning at 74
   - Will have SBT with Passy Muir valve this morning
   - ABG and VBG yesterday correlated well
   10. H/o HIT with need to be anticoagulated. LENI's are negative
   - Started on Argatroban gtt for PE prophylaxis per Heme recs with goal
   PTT 40-60
   - Currently within range at 0.2 mcg/kg/hr with PTT 50 so will continue
   as is
   11. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147
   - Will increase free water via G tube to 300 q4hrs, but is a delicate
   balance between lowering pt

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical conditions and complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient presented with signs of urosepsis and atrial tachycardia/AFib. The g-tube evaluation showed proper functioning, and there is no longer an active issue with it. However, the patient has sputum with Pseudomonas, which is being treated.

2. The patient has cirrhotic liver disease with positive anti-smooth muscle antibody and elevated IgG, consistent with autoimmune hepatitis etiology. He had significant ascites that was tapped twice, and the second tap showed less PMNs. Cx's from the last paracentesis and the recent urine culture have been negative.

3. The patient's respiratory status remains a concern. He is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tracheostomy tube. There is moderate bilateral pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. The patient has failed extubation trials multiple times due to persistent respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia, RV dysfunction, PE, pulmonary HTN, or persistent pleural effusions.

4. The patient has an elevated serum creatinine level, indicating acute renal failure. There is also a concern for acute interstitial nephritis due to the presence of eosinophils in the urine.

5. The patient has a history of HIT ("

   A 73 year old gentleman who presented with signs of urosepsis with
   atrial tachycardia/AFib presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube
   appears to be properly functioning and is no longer an active issue.
   His urine has grown out <[**2112**] GNR
s, so unlikely a true infection and
   no longer and active issue. He also has sputum with Pseudomonas,
   currently being treated, which likely is a true infection. In his
   workup at this hospital it was learned that he has a cirrhotic liver,
   with positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth muscle, and elevated IgG, and had
   significant ascites that has been 9L tapped, and now s/p a second tap
   to assess for resolution. Current active issues are the
   etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis, managing the
   arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in sinus),
   managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy), and
   managing his trach/vent dependence, Pseudomonas pneumonia, and now most
   currently, a positive UA with eosinophils.
   1. Liver failure: Patient was found to have cirrhosis and ascites on
   imaging.  He had a paracentesis a couple days ago and 9L was removed
   and had a second para yesterday to assess for resolution, which showed
   less PMN's. Cx's from last para and Gstain from yesterday's para have
   been negative. Also with positive [**Doctor First Name **], positive anti-smooth muscle Ab
   and elevated IgG, consistent with autoimmune hepatitis etiology. Pt
   received some albumin with para yesterday.
   - F/u albumin this morning to calculate SAAG, but according to albumin
   from 4 days ago, would have SAAG <1.1 (0.5), differential including:
   peritonitis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, pancreatitis, vasculitides,
   hypoalbumin states, bowel obstruction, post-operative lymph leak
   - Added on amylase and lipase to this am's labs
   - F/u Cx's from most recent para yesterday
   - F/u with Hepatology today
   - Invite Hepatology to family meeting tomorrow at Wednesday 2pm
   2. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus. Have consulted Cards who rec an
   Amiodarone load then maintenance, which the pt was on in the past and
   stopped due to liver/lung issues. We have elected not to restart the
   Amiodarone due to this history of issues, but have started him on Dig
   instead.
   - Dig level is not elevated, will continue dosage as is.
   - Received some IV Labatelol yesterday
   - Increase Metoprolol to 37.5 PO bid today
   3. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt was on Cefepime/[**Name (NI) **], but yesterday d/c'd [**Name (NI) **]
   - Today is day 6 of Cefepime
   4. Fluid status--CXR with mild-mod pulm edema yesterday
   - Currently on Lasix gtt, will continue, now at 15mg / hr with goals
   150 cc/hr and 1-2L off per day.
   - Still about 5L positive today through LOS, but this may not reflect
   the 9L taken off during first para.
   5. Positive UA--Yesterday. On admission, concern for urosepsis but UCx
   only grow out <[**2112**] GNR's. Now with UA conerning for infxn yesterday,
   and have sent off UCx this am. Having low grade 100 temps for a couple
   days. WBC's at 9
   - F/u UCx.
   - Continues on Cefepime.
   - Hold off on starting new ABx for now but will consider broadening if
   urine Cx grows out
   6. Loculated pleural effusions, R > L.
   - Unsure what to do with this result in face of overall goals of care.
   Will be addressed at family meeting today whether to be aggressive with
   this or not.
   - Will need f/u of final CT read
   7. UA with persistent eosinophils, concerning for acute interstitial
   nephritis, in setting of persistently elevated Cr. DDx includes
   allergic rxn to drugs, infxns including pyelonephritis, and
   infiltrative diseases like sarcoid, lymphoma, leukemia.
   - Renal consult this am about eosinophilia.
   - Consider CT abdomen to assess for pyelonephritis
   8. Drifting down Hct: Has been slowly going down through admission and
   likely a consequence of phlebotomizing with q4 coag checks due to
   argatroban. No obvious source of bleeding and no hemodynamic changes.
   - As PTT is stabilizing, can space q4 coags to q6 and if continued
   stable PTT, likely just [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guiac all stools
   - Watch vitals signs
   - Will get pm Hct
   - Has triple lumen subclavian and L PIV
   - Type and screen this morning, transfuse for <21
   8. Persistent respiratory failure: Reportedly on vent for the last 6
   mos.  Failure to wean could be both pneumonia as well as component of
   weakness, echo findings of RV dysfunction suggesting possible PE
   (unable to anticoagulate d/t persistent GI bleed) or pulmonary HTN, or
   persistent pleural effusions due to persistent ascites.
   - Had SBT yesterday but got tachy and sweaty after several hours so put
   back on PS 8/5
   - Had good RSBI this morning at 74
   - Will have SBT with Passy Muir valve this morning
   - ABG and VBG yesterday correlated well
   5. H/o HIT with need to be anticoagulated. LENI's are negative
   - Started on Argatroban gtt for PE prophylaxis per Heme recs with goal
   PTT 40-60
   - Currently within range at 0.2 mcg/kg/hr with PTT 50 so will continue
   as is
   10. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147
   - Have increased free water boluses via G tube to 250cc q4
   - Measure pm Na
   NON ACTIVE:
   7. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been weaned.
   No longer an active issue
   - Watch hemodynamics through the day
   - Control tachycardia as above with BBlockade, as tolerated by bp
   - Cefipime for Pulm (pseudomonas) infectious sources
   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn
   9. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Likely a chronic renal insufficiency
   with Cr
s in the 2
s on admission. Lasix diuresis at OSH was also
   limited by renal failure. Of note, UA came back positive for urine
   eosinophils, concerning for acute interstitial nephritis.
   - Will get repeat UA, lytes, and urine eos to re-evaluate. If positive,
   would ask renal if they would treat for this AIN
   - Cr is chronically elevated, but will continue to trend.  Is 2.5 this
   morning, was 2.7 yesterday.
   - renally dose meds
   - Watch UOP through today
   11. Agitation / delirium: Have started seroquel and appears to be well
   tolerating
   -increase dose of seroquel today if needed.
   12. S/P CABG: Elevated troponins likely rate/renal function related.
   - ASA
   - Statin has been d/c
   13. Depression:
   - Continue Paxil
   14. ""Funny Carotids"" No signs of stroke, neuro exam WNL. Not an active
   issue.
   - carotid dopplers with <40% stenosis
   - not active issue
   15. DM: ISS, no standing for now
   16. G-tube malfunction: functioning per surgery, Radiology and nursing.
   Surgery has signed off. Not an active issue

","The patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia (Pseudomonas), and chronic respiratory failure. He presented with signs of urosepsis but is currently stable and in sinus rhythm. The patient's current active issues include the etiology and management of cirrhosis, management of arrhythmia, anticoagulation needs due to a history of HIT, and tracheal ventilation dependence.

The patient's recent medical interventions include a paracentesis that showed less PMNs, negative cultures, and a second para with albumin administration. He also received treatment for Pseudomonas pneumonia and has been on Lasix for fluid management. The patient's urine culture grew <[**2112**] GNRs, which are unlikely to be the true infection. His sputum culture grew Pseudomonas, which is being treated with Cefepime. The patient's recent lab results show elevated eosinophils in the urine, persistent renal failure, and mild hypernatremia.

The patient's imaging studies reveal moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, a large amount of ascites, and no evidence of pneumoperitoneum. The patient's physical examination shows an inability to assess peripheral pulses and skin due to the presence of tubes and lines.

The patient's assessment and plan include anxiety, pain control (acute and chronic), atrial fibrillation, asc"

   A 73 year old gentleman who presented with signs of urosepsis with
   atrial tachycardia/AFib presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube
   appears to be properly functioning and is no longer an active issue.
   His urine has grown out <[**2112**] GNR
s, so unlikely a true infection and
   no longer and active issue. He also has sputum with Pseudomonas,
   currently being treated, which likely is a true infection. In his
   workup at this hospital it was learned that he has a cirrhotic liver,
   with positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth muscle, and elevated IgG, and had
   significant ascites that has been 9L tapped, and now s/p a second tap
   to assess for resolution. Current active issues are the
   etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis, managing the
   arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in sinus),
   managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy), and
   managing his trach/vent dependence, Pseudomonas pneumonia, and now most
   currently, a positive UA with eosinophils and CT chest showing
   loculated effusions.
   #. Liver failure:  Patient
s SAAG>1.1, making differential once again
   cirrhosis vs right heart failure.  Amylase and lipase negative.  ?
   mental status could be due to ammonia levels?
   - continue cefepime.
   - given hepatohydrothorax, need to consider [**Last Name (un) 3024**] per hepatology.
   Patient was found to have cirrhosis and ascites on imaging.  Positive
   [**Doctor First Name **], positive anti-smooth muscle Ab and elevated IgG, consistent with
   autoimmune hepatitis etiology.
   - F/u Cx's from most recent para yesterday
   - F/u with Hepatology today
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Seen by renal yesterday.  Thought
   etiology ATN and AIN given elevated FENa off of diuretics.  Recommended
   bladder pressure and renal USG.  UA with persistent eosinophils,
   concerning for acute interstitial nephritis, in setting of persistently
   elevated Cr. DDx includes allergic rxn to drugs, infxns including
   pyelonephritis, and infiltrative diseases like sarcoid, lymphoma,
   leukemia.
   - Continue diuresis but give free water for
   - f/u bladder pressure
   #. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus and dig loaded.  Dig level this
   morning is reassuring.
   - Dig level is not elevated, will continue dosage as is.
   - Will get Dig level tomorrow morning
   - Received some IV Labatelol yesterday
   #. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt was on Cefepime/[**Name (NI) **], but yesterday d/c'd [**Name (NI) **]
   - Today is day 7 of Cefepime of 15 day course
   #. Positive UA--Yesterday. On admission, concern for urosepsis but UCx
   only grow out <[**2112**] GNR's. Now with UA conerning for infxn yesterday,
   and have sent off UCx this am. Having low grade 100 temps for a couple
   days. WBC's at 9
   - F/u UCx.
   - Continues on Cefepime.
   - Hold off on starting new ABx for now but will consider broadening if
   urine Cx grows out
   #. Persistent respiratory failure: IP will do a thoracentesis today.
   Patient changed to argatroban in preparation.
   Reportedly on vent for the last 6 mos.  Failure to wean could be both
   pneumonia as well as component of weakness, echo findings of RV
   dysfunction suggesting possible PE (unable to anticoagulate d/t
   persistent GI bleed) or pulmonary HTN, or persistent pleural effusions
   due to persistent ascites.
   - Had SBT yesterday but got tachy and sweaty after several hours so put
   back on PS 8/5
   - Had good RSBI this morning at 74
   - Will have SBT with Passy Muir valve this morning
   - ABG and VBG yesterday correlated well
   #. Loculated pleural effusions, R > L.
   - Unsure what to do with this result in face of overall goals of care.
   Will be addressed at family meeting today whether to be aggressive with
   this or not.
   - Will need f/u of final CT read
   - Consult IP about draining them today, and if we proceed, will need to
   have Argatroban stopped for procedure.
   #. Anemia: Has been slowly going down through admission and likely a
   consequence of phlebotomizing with q4 coag checks due to argatroban. No
   obvious source of bleeding and no hemodynamic changes. Had iron studies
   this admission showing low level iron and labs consistent with anemia
   of chronic disease. Also, had hematuria on most recent UA, but urine is
   clear and blood loss in urine unlikely to be hemodynamically relevant,
   but will need to watch and consider if continued drop in Hct.
   - As PTT is stabilizing, can space q4 coags to q6 and if continued
   stable PTT, likely just [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guiac all stools
   - Watch vitals signs
   - Will get pm Hct
   - Has triple lumen subclavian and L PIV
   - Type and screen this morning, transfuse for <21
   #. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147
   - Will increase free water via G tube to 300 q4hrs, but is a delicate
   balance between lowering pt
s hypernatremia and trying to get fluids
   off him with Lasix gtt
   - Measure pm Na
   #. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been weaned.
   No longer an active issue
   - Watch hemodynamics through the day
   - Control tachycardia as above with BBlockade, as tolerated by bp
   - Cefipime for Pulm (pseudomonas) infectious sources
   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn
   #. Agitation / delirium: Have started seroquel and appears to be well
   tolerating
   -increase dose of seroquel today if needed.
   #. S/P CABG: Concerned about dehiscence of sternotomy wound.
   Elevated troponins likely rate/renal function related.
   - ASA
   - Statin has been d/c
   #. Depression:
   - Continue Paxil

   A 73 year old gentleman who presented with signs of urosepsis with
   atrial tachycardia/AFib presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube
   appears to be properly functioning and is no longer an active issue.
   His urine has grown out <[**2112**] GNR
s, so unlikely a true infection and
   no longer and active issue. He also has sputum with Pseudomonas,
   currently being treated, which likely is a true infection. In his
   workup at this hospital it was learned that he has a cirrhotic liver,
   with positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth muscle, and elevated IgG, and had
   significant ascites w/ 9L tapped and apparent SBP, and now s/p a second
   tap to assess for resolution. Current active issues are the
   etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis, managing the
   arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in sinus),
   managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy), and
   managing his trach/vent dependence, Pseudomonas pneumonia, and now most
   currently, a positive UA with eosinophils and CT chest showing
   loculated effusions.
   #. Liver failure:  Patient
s SAAG>1.1, making differential once again
   cirrhosis vs right heart failure.  Amylase and lipase negative.  His
   altered mental status may in part be to
   - continue cefepime.  Consider changing to aztreonam because of AIN,
   but we will wait to check sensitivities before making that change.
   - given hepatohydrothorax, need to consider [**Last Name (un) 3024**] per hepatology.
   - f/u hepatology recs.
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Seen by renal yesterday.  Thought
   etiology ATN and AIN given elevated FENa off of diuretics.  Recommended
   bladder pressure and renal USG.  UA with persistent eosinophils, DDx
   includes allergic rxn to drugs, infxns including pyelonephritis, and
   infiltrative diseases like sarcoid, lymphoma, leukemia.
   - Continue diuresis but give free water for hypernatremia.
   - f/u bladder pressure
   #. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus and dig loaded.  Dig level this
   morning is reassuring.
   - Dig level is not elevated, will continue dosage as is.
   - Will get Dig level tomorrow morning
   - Received some IV Labatelol yesterday
   #. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt was on Cefepime/[**Name (NI) **], but yesterday d/c'd [**Name (NI) **]
   - Today is day 7 of Cefepime of 15 day course
   #. Positive UA--Yesterday. On admission, concern for urosepsis but UCx
   only grow out <[**2112**] GNR's. Now with UA conerning for infxn yesterday,
   and have sent off UCx this am. Having low grade 100 temps for a couple
   days. WBC's at 9
   - F/u UCx.
   - Continues on Cefepime.
   - Hold off on starting new ABx for now but will consider broadening if
   urine Cx grows out
   #. Persistent respiratory failure: IP will do a thoracentesis today.
   Patient changed to argatroban in preparation.
   Reportedly on vent for the last 6 mos.  Failure to wean could be both
   pneumonia as well as component of weakness, echo findings of RV
   dysfunction suggesting possible PE (unable to anticoagulate d/t
   persistent GI bleed) or pulmonary HTN, or persistent pleural effusions
   due to persistent ascites.
   - Had SBT yesterday but got tachy and sweaty after several hours so put
   back on PS 8/5
   - Had good RSBI this morning at 74
   - Will have SBT with Passy Muir valve this morning
   - ABG and VBG yesterday correlated well
   #. Loculated pleural effusions, R > L.
   - Unsure what to do with this result in face of overall goals of care.
   Will be addressed at family meeting today whether to be aggressive with
   this or not.
   - Will need f/u of final CT read
   - Consult IP about draining them today, and if we proceed, will need to
   have Argatroban stopped for procedure.
   #. Anemia: Has been slowly going down through admission and likely a
   consequence of phlebotomizing with q4 coag checks due to argatroban. No
   obvious source of bleeding and no hemodynamic changes. Had iron studies
   this admission showing low level iron and labs consistent with anemia
   of chronic disease. Also, had hematuria on most recent UA, but urine is
   clear and blood loss in urine unlikely to be hemodynamically relevant,
   but will need to watch and consider if continued drop in Hct.
   - As PTT is stabilizing, can space q4 coags to q6 and if continued
   stable PTT, likely just [**Hospital1 **]

   - Has triple lumen subclavian and L PIV
   - Type and screen this morning, transfuse for <21
   #. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147
   - Will increase free water via G tube to 300 q4hrs, but is a delicate
   balance between lowering pt
s hypernatremia and trying to get fluids
   off him with Lasix gtt
   - Measure pm Na
   #. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive with poor urine output on
   admission, and thought to be distributive shock from urosepsis or PNA
   and started on ABx. Was started on pressors which have now been weaned.
   No longer an active issue
   - Watch hemodynamics through the day
   - Control tachycardia as above with BBlockade, as tolerated by bp
   - Cefipime for Pulm (pseudomonas) infectious sources
   - NS bolus to improve urine output prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of urosepsis, atrial tachycardia, cirrhosis, and chronic renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for evaluation and treatment. The patient's current conditions include liver failure, acute on chronic renal failure, arrhythmia, Pseudomonas pneumonia, positive urine analysis with eosinophils, and loculated pleural effusions. He is also experiencing agitation and delirium, hypernatremia, hypotension, and possible depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is compromised due to cirrhosis, leading to impaired metabolism of drugs and potential hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicating an acute exacerbation of his pre-existing chronic renal failure. This may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and increased risk of infection.
3. Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial tachycardia and requires management to maintain sinus rhythm. Failure to control the arrhythmia could lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or thromboembolism.
4. Pseudomonas Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, which can be difficult to treat and may require extended duration of antibiotic therapy. If not appropriately managed, this"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who presented with signs of urosepsis and atrial tachycardia. He has a history of cirrhosis, positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies, elevated IgG, and significant ascites with a previous spinal fluid puncture. He also has a tracheostomy and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current active issues include the etiology/workup/management plan of cirrhosis, managing the arrhythmia, HIT with anticoagulation needs, and managing tracheal/ventilator dependence, Pseudomonas pneumonia, and a positive urine analysis with eosinophils. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Liver failure: The patient's SAAG is greater than 1.1, making it difficult to differentiate between cirrhosis and right heart failure. Further evaluation and management are required.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has impaired renal function, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity (AIN). Recommended bladder pressure and renal ultrasound, as well as continuing diuresis with free water for hypernatremia.
3. Arrhythmia: The patient was in atrial fibrillation on admission but is now in sinus rhythm. He is on digoxin, and the levels are reassuring. Continue with current dosing.
4. Pneumonia: Pseudomonas aeruginosa"

   A 73 year old gentleman who presented with signs of urosepsis with
   atrial tachycardia/AFib presenting for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube
   appears to be properly functioning and is no longer an active issue.
   His urine has grown out <[**2112**] GNR
s, so unlikely a true infection and
   no longer and active issue. He also has sputum with Pseudomonas,
   currently being treated, which likely is a true infection. In his
   workup at this hospital it was learned that he has a cirrhotic liver,
   with positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth muscle, and elevated IgG, and had
   significant ascites w/ 9L tapped and apparent SBP, and now s/p a second
   tap to assess for resolution. Current active issues are the
   etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis, managing the
   arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in sinus),
   managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy), and
   managing his trach/vent dependence, Pseudomonas pneumonia, and now most
   currently, a positive UA with eosinophils and CT chest showing
   loculated effusions.
   #. Liver failure:  Patient
s SAAG>1.1, making differential once again
   cirrhosis vs right heart failure.  Amylase and lipase negative.  His
   altered mental status may in part be to
   - continue cefepime.  Consider changing to aztreonam because of AIN,
   but we will wait to check sensitivities before making that change.
   - given hepatohydrothorax, need to consider [**Last Name (un) 3024**] per hepatology.
   - f/u hepatology recs.
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Seen by renal yesterday.  Thought
   etiology ATN and AIN given elevated FENa off of diuretics.  Recommended
   bladder pressure and renal USG.  UA with persistent eosinophils, DDx
   includes allergic rxn to drugs (esp. PCNs and H2B), infxns including
   pyelonephritis, and infiltrative diseases like sarcoid, lymphoma,
   leukemia.
   - if pseudomonas is aztreonam sensitive will switch from cefepime as
   that could be causing her AIN.
   - Continue diuresis but give free water for hypernatremia.
   - f/u bladder pressure
   #. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus and dig loaded.  Dig level this
   morning is reassuring.  Will continue with current dosing.
   #. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to [**Last Name (un) **].  Will check sensitivities to Aztreonam for possible switch.
   - Today is day 7 of 15 day course of antibiotics.
   #. Persistent respiratory failure: Likely a combination of pneumonia,
   pleural effusions and fluid overload.  IP will do a thoracentesis today
   which will hopefully provide some symptomatic relief.  If the tap helps
   and the effusion is recurrent, hepatology would like us to consider a
   TIPS procedure.  Patient changed to argatroban in preparation.
   - continue diuresis
   - Continue daily SBT/trach mask trials
   - ABG and VBG yesterday correlated well, if stabilized we could maybe
   take A-line out tomorrow.
   #. Anemia: Has a stable microcytic anemia. Had iron studies this
   admission showing low level iron and labs consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease.
   - Guiac all stools
   - Type and screen this morning, transfuse for <21
   #. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147.  We are currently holding free water as we await
   thoracocentesis.  If his PM Na is increased, can consider giving D5W.
   - Measure pm Na
   #. Agitation / delirium: Have started seroquel and appears to be well
   tolerating
   - Continue PRN Seroquel 25mg
   #. S/P CABG: Concerned about dehiscence of sternotomy wound on CT.
   This finding was also seen on previous CT, when cardiac surgery was
   consulted.  They were not concerned.
   - ASA

","The patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, presenting with signs of urosepsis and atrial tachycardia. He has been evaluated for g-tube placement and has a functioning g-tube. His urine culture grew gram-negative rods, but this is likely a contaminant and not an active infection. However, his sputum culture showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is being treated.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis with positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies and elevated IgG levels. He also has significant ascites, and a diagnostic tap revealed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He underwent a second tap to assess for resolution. The current issues include the etiology and management plan for his cirrhosis, managing his atrial arrhythmia (currently in sinus rhythm), managing his history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophylaxis), and managing his tracheostomy/ventilator dependence, Pseudomonas pneumonia, and positive urinalysis with eosinophils.

The patient's liver function tests indicate liver failure, with a serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) greater than 1.1, suggesting that the differential diagnosis is between cirrhosis and right heart failure. Amylase and lipase levels are negative, ruling out acute pancreatitis.

The patient also has acute"

   A 73 year old gentleman who presented with urosepsis and atrial
   tachycardia/AFib for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning.  Being treated for Pseudomonas pneumonia based on
   sputum cultures with cefepime. In his workup at this hospital it was
   learned that he has a cirrhotic liver, with positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth
   muscle, and elevated IgG, and had significant ascites w/ 9L tapped and
   apparent SBP, and now s/p a second tap with improvement. Current active
   issues are the etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis,
   managing the arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in
   sinus), managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy),
   and managing his trach/vent dependence w/ diuresis and thoracocentesis,
   Pseudomonas pneumonia Rx w/ cefepime, and a new leukocytosis.
   #. Leukocytosis: Today patient had abrupt rise in WBC of unclear
   source.  Not on steroids, w/o clear stressor and no clinically apparent
   infectious source.  We had been treating a pseudomonas pneumonia with
   cefepime.  He is not being treated for MRSA or VRE, and pseudomonas has
   high rates of developing resistance.
   - pan-culture and send for c.diff.
   - CXR for possible pneumonia
   #. Liver failure:  Patient
s SAAG>1.1, making differential once again
   cirrhosis vs right heart failure.  Amylase and lipase negative.  His
   altered mental status may in part be due to ammonia/decreased hepatic
   clearance, so we are giving lactulose.  His positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth
   muscle, and elevated IgG are all suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis.
   - continue cefepime.  Consider changing to aztreonam because of AIN,
   but we will wait to check sensitivities before making that change.
   - given hepatohydrothorax, need to consider [**Last Name (un) 3024**] per hepatology.
   - we will consider a liver biopsy prior to discharge to better
   determine etiology of liver failure and ? autoimmune hepatitis.
   - f/u hepatology recs.
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Thought etiology ATN and AIN given
   elevated FENa off of diuretics.  Recommended bladder pressure and renal
   USG.  UA with persistent eosinophils, and eosinophilia on differential.
    Renal U/S normal.
   - if pseudomonas is aztreonam sensitive will switch from cefepime as
   that could be causing her AIN.
   - Continue diuresis but give free water for hypernatremia.
   - f/u renal recs.
   #. Persistent respiratory failure: Has improved with combination of
   diuresis and thoracocentesis and today is tolerating trach mask trial
   longer than previously.  If the effusion is recurrent, hepatology would
   like us to consider a TIPS procedure.
   - continue diuresis
   - restart argatroban for DVT prophylaxis.
   - Continue daily SBT/trach mask trials
   - ABG and VBG yesterday correlated well so no need to replace A-line.
   #. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Now back up,
   which may be contributing to his altered mental status.  We will be
   more aggressive in our correction, giving a 500cc D5W bolus.  We can
   also resume 300cc free water flushes Q4hrs with tube feeds.
   - Measure pm Na
   #. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus and dig loaded.  Dig level this
   morning is reassuring.  Will continue with current dosing.
   #. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to Cipro.  Will check sensitivities to Aztreonam for possible switch.
   - Today is day 8 of 15 day course of antibiotics.
   #. Anemia: Has a stable microcytic anemia. Had iron studies this
   admission showing low level iron and labs consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease.
   - Guiac all stools
   - Type and screen this morning, transfuse for <21
   #. Agitation / delirium: Have started seroquel and appears to be well
   tolerating
   - Continue PRN Seroquel 25mg
   #. S/P CABG: Concerned about dehiscence of sternotomy wound on CT.
   This finding was also seen on previous CT, when cardiac surgery was
   consulted.  They were not concerned.
   - continue ASA, stopped statin given elevated LFTs.
   #. Depression: - Continue Paxil
   #. DM: ISS, no standing for now

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient had an abrupt rise in WBC of unclear source. This could be due to a secondary infection or an inflammatory response.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's SAAG > 1.1, making it difficult to differentiate between cirrhosis and right heart failure. Altered mental status may be due to ammonia/decreased hepatic clearance, so lactulose is being given. Positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies and elevated IgG are suggestive of autoimmune"

   A 73 year old gentleman who presented with urosepsis and atrial
   tachycardia/AFib for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning. His urine has grown out <[**2112**] GNR
s, so unlikely
   a true infection and no longer and active issue. He also has sputum
   with Pseudomonas, currently being treated, which likely is a true
   infection. In his workup at this hospital it was learned that he has a
   cirrhotic liver, with positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth muscle, and elevated
   IgG, and had significant ascites w/ 9L tapped and apparent SBP, and now
   s/p a second tap to assess for resolution. Current active issues are
   the etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis, managing the
   arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in sinus),
   managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy), and
   managing his trach/vent dependence, Pseudomonas pneumonia, and now most
   currently, a positive UA with eosinophils and CT chest showing
   loculated effusions.
   #. Liver failure:  Patient
s SAAG>1.1, making differential once again
   cirrhosis vs right heart failure.  Amylase and lipase negative.  His
   altered mental status may in part be to
   - continue cefepime.  Consider changing to aztreonam because of AIN,
   but we will wait to check sensitivities before making that change.
   - given hepatohydrothorax, need to consider [**Last Name (un) 3024**] per hepatology.
   - f/u hepatology recs.
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Seen by renal yesterday.  Thought
   etiology ATN and AIN given elevated FENa off of diuretics.  Recommended
   bladder pressure and renal USG.  UA with persistent eosinophils, DDx
   includes allergic rxn to drugs (esp. PCNs and H2B), infxns including
   pyelonephritis, and infiltrative diseases like sarcoid, lymphoma,
   leukemia.
   - if pseudomonas is aztreonam sensitive will switch from cefepime as
   that could be causing her AIN.
   - Continue diuresis but give free water for hypernatremia.
   - f/u bladder pressure
   #. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus and dig loaded.  Dig level this
   morning is reassuring.  Will continue with current dosing.
   #. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to Cipro.  Will check sensitivities to Aztreonam for possible switch.
   - Today is day 7 of 15 day course of antibiotics.
   #. Persistent respiratory failure: Likely a combination of pneumonia,
   pleural effusions and fluid overload.  IP will do a thoracentesis today
   which will hopefully provide some symptomatic relief.  If the tap helps
   and the effusion is recurrent, hepatology would like us to consider a
   TIPS procedure.  Patient changed to argatroban in preparation.
   - continue diuresis
   - Continue daily SBT/trach mask trials
   - ABG and VBG yesterday correlated well, if stabilized we could maybe
   take A-line out tomorrow.
   #. Anemia: Has a stable microcytic anemia. Had iron studies this
   admission showing low level iron and labs consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease.
   - Guiac all stools
   - Type and screen this morning, transfuse for <21
   #. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Back up this
   morning to 147.  We are currently holding free water as we await
   thoracocentesis.  If his PM Na is increased, can consider giving D5W.
   - Measure pm Na
   #. Agitation / delirium: Have started seroquel and appears to be well
   tolerating
   - Continue PRN Seroquel 25mg

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical complications, including cirrhosis, acute kidney injury, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of g-tube evaluation and has sputum culture positive for Pseudomonas. The patient's current issues include the etiology and management of cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation needs due to a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, tracheostomy/ventilator dependence, and positive urinalysis with eosinophils. The patient also has loculated pleural effusions on CT chest.

The patient's liver function tests show a SAAG greater than 1.1, indicating portal hypertension rather than right heart failure. The patient's mental status may be due to continued cefepime use, and there is a consideration for changing antibiotics to aztreonam due to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Hepatohydrothorax needs to be considered, and hepatology recommendations should be followed.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely due to ATN and AIN. Renal USG and bladder pressure monitoring are recommended. The patient's urine culture grew gram-negative rods, so it is unlikely to be a true infection. However, sputum culture is positive for Pseudomonas, which is being treated.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 73 year old gentleman who presented with urosepsis and atrial
   tachycardia/AFib for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning.  Being treated for Pseudomonas pneumonia based on
   sputum cultures with cefepime. In his workup at this hospital it was
   learned that he has a cirrhotic liver, with positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth
   muscle, and elevated IgG, and had significant ascites w/ 9L tapped and
   apparent SBP, and now s/p a second tap with improvement. Current active
   issues are the etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis,
   managing the arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in
   sinus), managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy),
   and managing his trach/vent dependence w/ diuresis and thoracocentesis,
   Pseudomonas pneumonia Rx w/ cefepime, and a new leukocytosis.
    .
   #. Leukocytosis: Today patient had abrupt rise in WBC of unclear
   source.  Not on steroids, w/o clear stressor and no clinically apparent
   infectious source.  We had been treating a pseudomonas pneumonia with
   cefepime.  He is not being treated for MRSA or VRE, and pseudomonas has
   high rates of developing resistance. Sent for pan culture and all has
   been NTD. WBC count improving today.
   - CTM WBC and fevers
   - Continue cefipime, consider changing abio if not improving.  Also,
   consider changing if has [**Last Name (un) 270**] to aztreonam d/t AIN
   .
   #. Liver failure:  Patient
s SAAG>1.1, making differential once again
   cirrhosis vs right heart failure.  Amylase and lipase negative.  His
   altered mental status may in part be due to ammonia/decreased hepatic
   clearance, so we are giving lactulose.  His positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth
   muscle, and elevated IgG are all suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis.
   - continue cefepime.  Consider changing to aztreonam because of AIN,
   but we will wait to check sensitivities before making that change.
   - given hepatohydrothorax, need to consider [**Last Name (un) 3024**] per hepatology.
   - liver biopsy prior to discharge to better determine etiology of liver
   failure and ? autoimmune hepatitis.
   - hepatology recommends neostigmine if remains distended
   - f/u hepatology recs.
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Thought etiology ATN and AIN given
   elevated FENa off of diuretics.  Recommended bladder pressure and renal
   USG.  UA with persistent eosinophils, and eosinophilia on
   differential.  Renal U/S normal.
   - if pseudomonas is aztreonam sensitive will switch from cefepime as
   that could be causing her AIN.
   - Continue diuresis but give free water for hypernatremia.
   - f/u renal recs.
    .
   #. Persistent respiratory failure: Has improved with combination of
   diuresis and thoracocentesis and today is tolerating trach mask trial
   longer than previously.  If the effusion is recurrent, hepatology would
   like us to consider a TIPS procedure.   On trach mask for >24hours and
   tolerating well.
   - continue diuresis PRN
   - restarted argatroban for DVT prophylaxis.
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Now back up
   to 146, which may be contributing to his altered mental status.  We
   will be more aggressive in our correction, giving a 500cc D5W bolus.
   We can also resume 300cc free water flushes Q4hrs with tube feeds.
   - Give d5W to repair
   - Measure Na in aft.
   .
   #. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus and dig loaded.    Will continue
   with current dosing.
   .
   #. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to Cipro.  Will check sensitivities to Aztreonam for possible switch.
   - Today is day 9 of 15 day course of antibiotics.
   .
   #. Anemia: Has a stable microcytic anemia. Had iron studies this
   admission showing low level iron and labs consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease.  Hct improving.  Has known GI bleed
   - Continue to monitor Hct daily
   - Transfuse for <21
   .
   #. Agitation / delirium: Have started seroquel and appears to be well
   tolerating
   - Continue PRN Seroquel 25mg
   .
   #. S/P CABG: Concerned about dehiscence of sternotomy wound on CT.
   This finding was also seen on previous CT, when cardiac surgery was
   consulted.  They were not concerned.
   - continue ASA, stopped statin given elevated LFTs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of urosepsis, atrial tachycardia, cirrhotic liver, positive anti-smooth muscle antibody, elevated IgG, significant ascites with 9L tapped, apparent SBP, and a tracheostomy/vent dependence. The patient's current issues include the etiology/workup/management plan of cirrhosis, managing atrial fibrillation, HIT with anticoagulation needs, tracheostomy/vent dependence, pseudomonas pneumonia treatment with cefepime, and new leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an abrupt rise in WBC count of unclear source. It is essential to identify the cause of leukocytosis as it could indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying condition.
2. Liver failure: The patient has cirrhosis, positive anti-smooth muscle antibody, elevated IgG, and significant ascites. These findings suggest autoimmune hepatitis, and further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology of liver failure. The patient may require lactulose for ammonia control and should be monitored for hepatohydrothorax.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has persistent eosinophils in the urine and eosinophilia on differential. Renal USG shows normal findings. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and if pseudomonas is az"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 73 year old gentleman who presented with urosepsis and atrial
   tachycardia/AFib for g-tube evaluation.  His g-tube appears to be
   properly functioning.  Being treated for Pseudomonas pneumonia based on
   sputum cultures with cefepime. In his workup at this hospital it was
   learned that he has a cirrhotic liver, with positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth
   muscle, and elevated IgG, and had significant ascites w/ 9L tapped and
   apparent SBP, and now s/p a second tap with improvement. Current active
   issues are the etiology/workup/management plan of this cirrhosis,
   managing the arrhythmia that he presented with (currently continues in
   sinus), managing his h/o HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophy),
   and managing his trach/vent dependence w/ diuresis and thoracocentesis,
   Pseudomonas pneumonia Rx w/ cefepime, and a new leukocytosis.
    .
   #. Leukocytosis: Today patient had abrupt rise in WBC of unclear
   source.  Not on steroids, w/o clear stressor and no clinically apparent
   infectious source.  We had been treating a pseudomonas pneumonia with
   cefepime.  He is not being treated for MRSA or VRE, and pseudomonas has
   high rates of developing resistance. Sent for pan culture and all has
   been NTD. WBC count improving today.
   - CTM WBC and fevers
   - Continue cefipime, consider changing abio if not improving
   .
   #. Liver failure:  Patient
s SAAG>1.1, making differential once again
   cirrhosis vs right heart failure.  Amylase and lipase negative.  His
   altered mental status may in part be due to ammonia/decreased hepatic
   clearance, so we are giving lactulose.  His positive [**Doctor First Name **], anti smooth
   muscle, and elevated IgG are all suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis.
   - continue cefepime.  Consider changing to aztreonam because of AIN,
   but we will wait to check sensitivities before making that change.
   - given hepatohydrothorax, need to consider [**Last Name (un) 3024**] per hepatology.
   - we will consider a liver biopsy prior to discharge to better
   determine etiology of liver failure and ? autoimmune hepatitis.
   - hepatology recommends neostigmine if remains distended
   - f/u hepatology recs.
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Thought etiology ATN and AIN given
   elevated FENa off of diuretics.  Recommended bladder pressure and renal
   USG.  UA with persistent eosinophils, and eosinophilia on
   differential.  Renal U/S normal.
   - if pseudomonas is aztreonam sensitive will switch from cefepime as
   that could be causing her AIN.
   - Continue diuresis but give free water for hypernatremia.
   - f/u renal recs.
    .
   #. Persistent respiratory failure: Has improved with combination of
   diuresis and thoracocentesis and today is tolerating trach mask trial
   longer than previously.  If the effusion is recurrent, hepatology would
   like us to consider a TIPS procedure.
   - continue diuresis
   - restart argatroban for DVT prophylaxis.
   - Continue daily SBT/trach mask trials
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Hypovolemic hypernatremia on admission. Now back up
   to 146, which may be contributing to his altered mental status.  We
   will be more aggressive in our correction, giving a 500cc D5W bolus.
   We can also resume 300cc free water flushes Q4hrs with tube feeds.
   - Give d5W 1000ml
   - Measure pm Na
   .
   #. Arrhythmia: Per cards, pt was in Atach, Afib on admission, was given
   Adenosine and BBlocker. Now in sinus and dig loaded.  Dig level this
   morning is reassuring.  Will continue with current dosing.
   .
   #. PNA: Pseudomonas cultured, is sensitive to Cefipime, but resistant
   to Cipro.  Will check sensitivities to Aztreonam for possible switch.
   - Today is day 9 of 15 day course of antibiotics.
   .
   #. Anemia: Has a stable microcytic anemia. Had iron studies this
   admission showing low level iron and labs consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease.  Hct improving.  Has known GI bleed
   - Continue to monitor Hct daily
   - Transfuse for <21
   .
   #. Agitation / delirium: Have started seroquel and appears to be well
   tolerating
   - Continue PRN Seroquel 25mg
   .
   #. S/P CABG: Concerned about dehiscence of sternotomy wound on CT.
   This finding was also seen on previous CT, when cardiac surgery was
   consulted.  They were not concerned.
   - continue ASA, stopped statin given elevated LFTs.
   .
   #. Depression: - Continue Paxil

","The patient is a 73-year-old male who presented with urosepsis and atrial tachycardia/fibrillation for g-tube evaluation. He is currently being treated for Pseudomonas pneumonia based on sputum cultures with cefepime. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, positive anti-smooth muscle antibody, and elevated IgG, along with significant ascites with 9 liters tapped and apparent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He also has a history of HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophylaxis), tracheostomy/ventilator dependence with diuresis and thoracocentesis, and hypernatremia.

The patient's current active issues include the etiology/workup/management plan of his cirrhosis, managing the arrhythmia that he presented with (currently in sinus rhythm), managing his history of HIT with anticoagulation needs (DVT prophylaxis), and managing his tracheostomy/ventilator dependence with diuresis and thoracocentesis, Pseudomonas pneumonia treatment with cefepime, and a new leukocytosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Leukocytosis: The patient had an abrupt rise in WBC count of unclear source. This could indicate an ongoing infection or a reaction to medication.
2. Liver failure: The patient's SAAG is greater than 1."

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Pseudomonas pneumonia: The patient is being treated for Pseudomonas pneumonia with cefepime. However, the organism has high rates of developing resistance, so it is important to monitor for any signs of treatment failure or worsening infection.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has had an abrupt rise in white blood cell (WBC) count of unclear source. This could be due to an ongoing infection or other inflammatory processes. It is necessary to evaluate and treat the underlying cause of leukocytosis.

3. Liver failure: The patient's SAAG (Serum-Ascites Albumin Gradient) is greater than 1.1, indicating that the differential diagnosis between cirrhosis and right heart failure should be considered. The patient also has positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies and elevated IgG, which are suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis. Further evaluation, including a liver biopsy, is needed to determine the etiology of liver failure.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Renal USG and bladder pressure measurements are recommended. If pseudomonas is aztreonam sensitive, switching from cefepime may be considered to avoid AIN.
