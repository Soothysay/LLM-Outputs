   73 year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma with h/o
   gastric outlet obstruction s/p stenting p/w hypotension, fever/chills,
   increased ascites and poor po intake.
   #  Hypotension: Ddx includes dehydration (s/p large volume paracentesis
   with likely associated fluid shifts), decreased venous return in
   setting of malignancy/venous obstruction, sepsis, decompensated CHF,
   GIB in setting of guaiac positive stool, PE.  Has received 3-3.5L IVF
   with persistent hypotension. Reassuringly lactate improved from 2.7
   -->2.1-->1.3 with IVF.
   -continue to treat infection with IV Zosyn
   -surveillance blood cultures
   -giving 1U blood this morning, could give NS boluses PRN for MAP >65
   -liver u/s with dopppler to evaluate for venous thrombosis
   -hold antihypertensives

   appeared hemoconcentrated, dropped from 34-28 with hydration, this is
   low normal for him. Today 23 is very low for him, although this is in
   the setting of IV hydration. Likely this is upper GI source, as bowel
   movements are not grossly bloody; cholangioCA is likely source.

","The patient is a 73-year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma, who presented with hypotension, tachycardia, abdominal pain, and fever/chills. The patient has a history of gastric outlet obstruction, for which he underwent stenting. He is also known to have coronary artery disease, diabetes, and liver metastases.

Upon admission, the patient received 3-3.5 liters of intravenous fluids but continued to be hypotensive. His lactate levels improved from 2.7 to 1.3 with IVF. The patient's blood cultures from admission grew gram-negative rods (GNR), most likely from a biliary source. He is currently being treated with IV Zosyn, and surveillance blood cultures are being done.

The patient's ascites fluid is transudative and does not meet the criteria for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Given his history of gastrointestinal (GI) source peritonitis and resistant Escherichia coli bacteremia, it is suspected that the fevers and chills are due to a GI source, especially with normal chest X-ray and oxygenation, and normal urinalysis.

The patient's poor oral intake is being addressed by slowly advancing his diet and providing nutrition recommendations. His atrial fibrillation (AF) is not anticoagulated, and he is on beta-blockers (BB), digoxin, and amiodarone at home. His"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma, gastric outlet obstruction, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and chronic liver disease. He presents with hypotension, tachycardia, fever/chills, increased ascites, and poor oral intake. The patient has received IV fluids and antibiotics for infection, but continues to be hypotensive. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and resistant E. coli bacteremia. His current vital signs include a temperature of 98.6°F, blood pressure of 85/52 mmHg, pulse rate of 114 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Physical examination reveals a thin elderly man who is fatigued but pleasant, with no signs of pain or confusion. His abdomen is distended with ascites, and he has a well-healed scar in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoalbuminemia, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures grew Gram-negative rods, likely from a biliary source. The assessment includes hypotension, fevers/chills, poor oral intake, atrial fibrillation, cholangiocarcinoma, ascites, coronary artery disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The plan includes continuing treatment for infection, monitoring"

 ASCITES
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Patient is a 73 yo male with history of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma
   now admitted to the ICU with significant findings of fatigue, chills,
   increased ascites and fever all consistent with sepsis.  Of note
   patient does have history of gastric outlet obstruction but active
   obstruction did not appear to be present. Admitted with evidence of
   hyptension/septic shock in the setting of recent paracentesis. He also
   appeared hypovolemic.
   IMP
   1) GNR septicemia/ hypotension - likely from biliary source exacerbated
   from impaired venous return/intravascular vol depletion.
   -Empiric Abx to continue
will need to follow culture results as Zosyn
   given intially
   -IVF/albumin bolus as needed
   -Will need to track CVP and CvO2
   -Check FeNa
   -check bladder pressure (may have hemodynamic effect on BP)
   2) Ascites - likely from underlying malignancy with liver mets
   -Follow abdominal exam
   -No need for pressors at this time
   -consider therapeutic para
   3) Acute Anemia/thrombocytopenia
   -likely dilutional but has some GI bleeding which will need to be
   followed - will likely require GI evaluation
   -Will need to trend HCT for concern of possible GI blood losses
   -PE unlikely and risk of GI bleed significant and will hold on further
   Rx
   4)Cholangiocarcinoma-
   -Will need to discuss ongoing Xeloda with primary oncology team in the
   setting of possible active infection
   Additional Issues to be addressed as defined in the note above. Patient
   remains full code. Goals of care will eventually need to be reassessed.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma with h/o
   gastric outlet obstruction s/p stenting p/w hypotension, fever/chills,
   increased ascites and poor po intake.
   # Fevers/Chills: Pt had low grade temps with chills with prior history
   of GPR peritonitis and resistant E. coli bacteremia. Ascites fluid
   transudative and does not meet criteria for SBP.  Given history and
   abnormal abdominal anatomy, suspect GI source most likely, especially
   given normal CXR and oxygenation, normal UA.  Blood cultures from
   admission growing pansensitive GNR with most likely source being
   biliary.
   -Will verify sensitivities with micro lab given h/o of cipro resistant
   E. coli but will likely switch pt to cipro for tx of pansensitive GNR
   given h/o cephalosporin allergy. Plan for total 14 day-course from
   first negative cultures.
   -F/u final cx data
   #  Hypotension: Ddx includes dehydration (s/p large volume paracentesis
   with likely associated fluid shifts), sepsis. Less likely are decreased
   venous return in setting of malignancy/venous obstruction (patent
   hepatic vasculature on U/S), decompensated CHF, GIB in setting of
   guaiac positive stool, PE.  Resolved over course of day yesterday.
   -Treat infection as above
   -Monitor Hct, active T&S as below
   -Restart home beta blocker today
   # AF: Not anticoagulated - on BB, digoxin (therapeutic level) and
   amiodarone at home. Initial RVR likely compensatory in setting of
   hypotension but resolved with fluids.
   -Continue dig and amio
   -Restart BB with strict holding parameters given improved BP
   # Cholangiocarcinoma: Inoperable.  Per report, though not in [**Name (NI) 179**], pt
   received oral chemotherapy [**4-13**]. Plan for resumption of chemotherapy per
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1183**].
   # Ascites: Likely related to portal hypertension (transudative) given
   diffuse liver metastases; cx NGTD. Last para was five days prior to
   admission for 5L fluid removal; pt with some discomfort.
   -F/u peritoneal fluid culture
   -Consider therapeutic paracentesis today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma, gastric outlet obstruction status post stenting, hypotension, fever/chills, increased ascites, and poor oral intake. 

The patient had heme-positive stools, a drop in hematocrit (Hct), and was transfused with blood products. There is concern for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, possibly from the cholangiocarcinoma. The patient's platelet count decreased by more than 50% within 24 hours, but this was likely due to dilutional effects rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), as repeat labs improved.

The patient is experiencing abdominal discomfort and increased ascites. His ascites fluid is transudative and does not meet the criteria for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). However, given the patient's history and abnormal abdominal anatomy, a GI source for the fever/chills is suspected, especially with normal chest X-ray (CXR) and urine analysis (UA). Blood cultures from admission are growing pan-sensitive Gram-negative rods (GNR), likely from a biliary source.

The patient's low-grade temperature with chills could be attributed to his prior history of gastrointestinal peritonitis and resistant E. coli bacteremia. Blood cultures from admission are growing pansensitive G"

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has several medical complications. These include fevers/chills, hypotension, low platelets, and coronary artery disease. The patient's blood cultures from admission grew pansensitive Gram-negative rods, most likely originating from the biliary tract. 

The patient was started on ciprofloxacin for the infection, and IV Zosyn was continued with follow-up cultures. The hypotension was likely due to dehydration following a large volume paracentesis or sepsis. Other potential causes like decreased venous return, decompensated congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, or pulmonary embolism were considered but less likely.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is not anticoagulated, and he is on beta blockers and digoxin. The plan is to continue with digoxin and amiodarone and restart the beta blocker with strict holding parameters due to improved blood pressure.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma with h/o
   gastric outlet obstruction s/p stenting p/w hypotension, fever/chills,
   increased ascites and poor po intake.
   # Fevers/Chills: Pt had low grade temps with chills with prior history
   of GPR peritonitis and resistant E. coli bacteremia. Ascites fluid
   transudative and does not meet criteria for SBP.  Given history and
   abnormal abdominal anatomy, suspect GI source most likely, especially
   given normal CXR and oxygenation, normal UA.  Blood cultures from
   admission growing pansensitive GNR with most likely source being
   biliary.
   -Continue Zosyn pending cx data
   -Surveillance cx x 48 h?
   #  Hypotension: Ddx includes dehydration (s/p large volume paracentesis
   with likely associated fluid shifts), sepsis. Less likely are decreased
   venous return in setting of malignancy/venous obstruction (patent
   hepatic vasculature on U/S), decompensated CHF, GIB in setting of
   guaiac positive stool, PE.  Resolved over course of day yesterday.
   -Continue to treat infection with IV Zosyn and f/u cultures
   -Monitor hct, active T&S as below -liver u/s with dopppler to evaluate
   for venous thrombosis
   -Restart home beta blocker today
   # Poor PO intake:
   -Slowly advance diet
   -Nutrition consult, supplements per recs
   # AF: Not anticoagulated - on BB, digoxin (therapeutic level) and
   amiodarone at home. Initial RVR likely compensatory in setting of
   hypotension but resolved with fluids.
   -Continue dig and amio
   -Restart BB with strict holding parameters given improved BP
   # Cholangiocarcinoma: Inoperable.  Per report, though not in [**Name (NI) 179**], pt
   received oral chemotherapy [**4-13**]. Plan for resumption of chemotherapy per
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1183**].
   # Ascites: Likely related to portal hypertension (transudative) given
   diffuse liver metastases; cx NGTD. Last para was five days prior to
   admission for 5L fluid removal; pt with some discomfort.
   -f/u peritoneal fluid culture
   -consider therapeutic paracentesis today
   -pain meds prn
   # Guaiac positive stool: Hematocrit initially slightly above baseline,
   likely hemoconcentrated. Concern for bleed in setting of drop yesterday
   but Hct remained stable after transfusion despite guaiac positive stool
   (?UGI source, likely cholangiocarcinoma); no evidence of hemolysis/DIC
   -continue ASA, plavix given significant CAD
   -[**Hospital1 **] hematocrits
   -keep active T&S
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI
   # Low platelets: Concern given >50% drop within 24 hours yesterday but
   likely dilutional rather than DIC (labs neg), HIT as improved on repeat
   labs.
   -Continue to trend
   # Coronary artery disease:
   -Continue ASA, plavix
   -Restart beta blocker today
   # Diabetes
   -Hold glipizide
   -HISS, diabetic diet

","The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma, gastric outlet obstruction post stenting, hypotension, fever/chills, increased ascites, and poor oral intake. He had low-grade temperatures with chills and a prior history of gastrointestinal peritonitis and resistant E. coli bacteremia. The ascites fluid is transudative and does not meet the criteria for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Blood cultures from admission are growing pan-sensitive Gram-negative rods, with the most likely source being biliary. 

The patient's hypotension could be due to dehydration after a large volume paracentesis or sepsis. Other less likely causes include decreased venous return in the setting of malignancy/venous obstruction, decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with guaiac positive stool, and pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient's poor oral intake may be related to his increased ascites and discomfort. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) but is not currently anticoagulated. His blood pressure has improved, so it may be appropriate to restart beta-blockers. 

The patient's cholangiocarcinoma is inoperable, and he has diffuse liver metastases. He received oral chemotherapy previously and will resume chemotherapy per Dr. [Last Name].

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma admitted to the ICU. He presented with symptoms of fatigue, chills, increased ascites, and fever, consistent with sepsis. The patient also had evidence of hypotension/septic shock, likely due to biliary source infection exacerbated by impaired venous return and intravascular volume depletion. The patient was hypovolemic and required aggressive fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR bacteremia/hypotension: The patient has a likely bacterial infection from a biliary source, which may lead to further complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
2. Ascites: The patient has significant ascites likely secondary to underlying malignancy with liver metastases. This can lead to complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or hepatic hydrothorax.
3. Acute anemia/thrombocytopenia: The patient may have acute anemia and thrombocytopenia due to dilutional effects from fluid resuscitation or possible GI bleeding. Close monitoring of hematocrit and platelet count is necessary.
4. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient's underlying malignancy can progress and lead to further complications such as jaundice, bile duct obstruction, or liver failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his sepsis, fluid balance, GI bleeding, and"
