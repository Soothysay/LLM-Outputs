   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 85 yo female with recent admission for C. diff
   colitis, admitted with sepsis in the setting of recurrent diarrhea.
   .
   #. Sepsis/Fevers/Leukocytosis: source most likely GI and from recurrent
   C. diff given severely elevated WBC.  UA weakly c/w infection but pt
   asymptomatic; CXR with possible b/l infiltrates but more likely
   atalectasis given small-ish lung volumes and lack of [**Last Name (un) **] sx.  Ischemic
   bowel with possible gut translocation also a consideration, though less
   likely given lack of pain/cramping and gross blood loss PR.
   -- f/u urine, blood cultures
   -- will obtain C. diff assay and will place on precautions
   -- will cover broadly with vanco/flagyl IV and cipro
   --Will add PO Vanco.
   --patient seems hypovolemic on exam
 will bolus 2L NS now and then try
   to wean levofed again.
   -- goal CVP 10 - 12; goal MAPs > 65 per sepsis protocol (note: pateint
   hypertensive at baseline)
   -- monitor lactate
   -- will hold home lasix and HTN meds for now
   -- CT A/P for ischemic bowel.
   -- compazine for nausea control

   #. ? ARF: no clear recent baseline in computer, but likely some
   prerenal ARF.  (one note documented baseline Cr at 1.4, but not
   certain).  UOP poor currently
   -- will monitor with administration of IVF
   -- will pre-hydrate for CT scan and treat with mucomist prior to scan.
   .
   #. Elevated INR: likely [**1-7**] diarrhea and possibly poor PO intake
   (though patient denied poor PO intake).
   -- monitor; will reverse if bleeding begins or INR worsens
   -- hold coumadin
   #. Hypertension: chronically on lisinopril and metoprolol
   -- will hold for now while septic
   #. FEN: IVF per sepsis protocol as above; NPO except meds due to
   continued abdominal pain and concern for bowel ischemia.
   #Patient on coumadin as outpatient for AFIb (confusing med rec b/c not
   listed in OMR or on med list on last d/c summary b/c was held on
   discharge).   INR supratherapeutic on admission in light of
   diarrhea/poor PO intake.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old female admitted with sepsis in the setting of recurrent diarrhea. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and central venous pressure (CVP) above 10. The patient's white blood cell count is significantly elevated at 22.3 K/uL, indicating an infection. The source of infection is likely gastrointestinal due to the recurrent C. diff colitis. There are also concerns for ischemic bowel and possible gut translocation, although these are less likely given the absence of pain or cramping and gross blood loss per rectum.

The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by a creatinine level of 1.2 and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 34.4. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal with an INR of 3.6, which may be due to diarrhea and poor oral intake. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 3 liters of supplemental oxygen. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis and recurrent diarrhea. She has a history of C. diff colitis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 93/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on multiple medications, including norepinephrine, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 22.3 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 117 mg/dL, and elevated INR at 3.6. The patient's urine output is 465 mL over the past 24 hours. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has been treated for sepsis with antibiotics, but the source of infection is still suspected to be gastrointestinal due to recurrent C. diff colitis. Further evaluation is needed to identify the exact source and complete treatment.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient may have prerenal AKI due to sepsis and dehydration. Monitoring with administration of IV fluids is recommended.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which could be related to hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, presenting with septic shock in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a SpO2 of 93%. Imaging reveals pancolitis with a dilated transverse colon, raising concerns for toxic megacolon. The patient has been receiving aggressive volume repletion but still requires substantial pressor support. Worsening lactatemia and leukocytosis indicate ongoing ischemic bowel/megacolon. The patient has been consented for colectomy with ileostomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Toxic Megacolon: This is a potential complication of C. diff colitis, characterized by severe inflammation and swelling of the colon, leading to impaired bowel function.
2. Ischemic Bowel: The patient's worsening lactatemia and leukocytosis suggest ischemic bowel, which can occur due to reduced blood flow to the intestines, potentially leading to necrosis and perforation.
3. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation indicates septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection leading to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and history of taking Coumadin suggest coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who presented with septic shock in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She has been admitted to the ICU and has had several interventions including changing vasopressor medications, placing a radial arterial line, and preparing for surgery. Her vital signs are unstable with tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has a high white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and evidence of ischemic bowel and toxic megacolon on CT scan. She is currently on contact precautions and will undergo a colectomy with ileostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock due to C. diff infection. If not managed appropriately, this condition can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and potentially death.
2. Ischemic Bowel: The CT scan shows evidence of ischemic bowel, which means there may be inadequate blood flow to the intestines. If left untreated, this can progress to bowel necrosis and perforation.
3. Toxic Megacolon: The CT scan also reveals toxic megacolon, a severe complication of C. diff colitis characterized by colon dilatation. If not promptly addressed, toxic megacolon can lead to perforation, peritonitis, and septic shock.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and hypertension. She presented with septic shock in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient underwent a colectomy on [**2141-6-10**] and required nearly 15 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) to maintain blood pressure and urine output. She responded well to 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) postoperatively with an increase in hemoglobin from 27 to 32.9%. The patient was successfully weaned off levophed and started on low-dose lopressor for tachycardia. She was also transitioned from assisted ventilation to pressure support ventilation (PSV).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypokalemia: The patient has a history of hypokalemia, which is currently stable. It is important to continue monitoring and managing potassium levels as per surgical recommendations.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has a persistent tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 110 to 130 beats per minute. Sedation and pain management with versed and fentanyl have been initiated, but if not responsive, it is recommended to start lopressor IV at 2.5 mg every 4 hours as needed for tachycardia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, who presented with septic shock secondary to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She required substantial pressor support despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and showed signs of ischemic bowel/megacolon on computed tomography (CT) scan. Her lactate levels were elevated, indicating worsening tissue perfusion. The patient's condition remained unstable, with persistent hypotension and inadequate urine output. She required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute kidney injury (AKI) and was placed on contact precautions for C. diff infection. The patient underwent an emergent colectomy/ileostomy and was continued on vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole. Her coagulopathy was managed with intravenous vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). She was also on cardiac monitoring due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). The patient's blood pressure remained unstable, and she required aggressive volume repletion. Her nutritional support involved withholding oral intake for surgery. The patient had multiple lines, including a right internal jugular (IJ) central line, two peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, and an arterial line. The patient's code status was full code."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, who is currently admitted to the ICU due to septic shock secondary to recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient underwent a colectomy on [**2141-6-10**] and required nearly 15 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) to maintain blood pressure and urine output peri and postoperatively. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 125 beats per minute with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 118/54 mmHg to 136/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 66%. The patient is receiving pressure support ventilation and has been weaned off levophed. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 34.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 32.9%, platelet count of 23.2, creatinine of 1.2, blood glucose of 154, and lactic acid level of 1.8 mmol/L. The patient's coagulation profile shows an INR of 1.4, PT of 15.3, and PTT of 32.6.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and hypertension, who presented with septic shock secondary to recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She underwent a colectomy and required aggressive volume repletion to maintain blood pressure and urine output. The patient's hemoglobin concentration responded well to a unit of packed red blood cells. She was successfully weaned off levophed and started on low-dose lopressor for tachycardia. The patient was also transitioned to pressure support ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been requiring substantial pressor support despite aggressive volume repletion, indicating a risk for persistent hypotension.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's inadequate urine output since midnight suggests the possibility of AKI, likely due to third-spacing of fluid and underperfusion.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR pre-operatively and post-operatively indicates a risk for bleeding complications.
4. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient has evidence of hyperdynamic left ventricular function with dystolic dysfunction, which may contribute to cardiac complications.
5. Infection: Given the patient's recent history of C. diff colitis and ongoing contact precautions, there is a risk for additional infections.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's current respiratory support on pressure support ventilation may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who presented with septic shock secondary to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient underwent colectomy on [**2141-6-10**] and required significant fluid resuscitation due to hypotension and inadequate urine output. The patient's hemodynamic status improved with the use of vasopressors and pressure support ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and signs of coagulopathy. Repeat coagulation studies have been ordered.

Assessment and Plan:
1. C. diff septic shock - The patient continues to require aggressive volume repletion and higher preload due to hyperdynamic left ventricular function with dystolic dysfunction.
2. Tachycardia - Continue sedation and pain management with versed and fentanyl; consider starting low-dose lopressor.
3. Coagulopathy - Administered 2 mg IV vit K and 3 U FFP followed by repeat coagulation studies.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response - Consider amiodarone load if hemodynamically stable post-op.
5. Acute Renal Failure - Continue aggressive volume repletion and monitor urine output. Maintain urine output >20 ml/hr as per surgical recommendations.
6. Hypertension - Hold antihypert"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension. She presented with septic shock in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She underwent a colectomy for definitive treatment of C. diff septic shock. Post-operatively, she required several liters of intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure and urine output. Currently, her blood pressure is stable without the use of pressors, but she has a higher preload requirement due to hyperdynamic left ventricular function with systolic dysfunction. 

She is receiving intravenous vancomycin, flagyl, and ciprofloxacin. Her potassium levels are stable, but she has ongoing hypokalemia, which will be managed with a sliding scale of potassium as per surgery recommendations. Her heart rate remains elevated, ranging from 110 to 130 beats per minute. She is currently sedated with versed and fentanyl, and her pain management will be increased. If she does not respond to increased fentanyl, she will be started on lopressor IV at a dose of 2.5 mg every four hours as needed for tachycardia.

The patient has a coagulopathy and was on outpatient coumadin. Her initial INR was 6.0 pre-operatively, and she received 2 mg of IV vitamin K and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma. Her post-operative INR is now 1.2, and her hematocrit is 32.9%. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and amiodarone may be considered if she remains hemodynamically stable and tachycardia persists post-operatively.

She experienced respiratory distress and was switched from assist-control ventilation to pressure support ventilation this morning. However, due to recent large-volume resuscitation, she will not be extubated today, so she was placed back on assist-control ventilation with a tidal volume of 4-6 cc/kg and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O.

The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.1 post large fluid resuscitation. Her urine output has been ranging from 20 to 30 cc/hr despite large-volume resuscitation. Efforts will be made to maintain urine output greater than 20 cc/hr per surgery recommendations. Bladder pressure will be monitored to determine the extent of third spacing in the abdomen. Large intravenous fluid boluses will be avoided unless necessary to maintain blood pressure, and attempts will be made to refrain from large IVF boluses unless needed.

Other assessments and plans include hypertension, which is controlled; fluid/electrolyte/nutrition management; lines and access; prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia; and code status. The patient is on full code status."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and recent septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy and is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 96/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 228.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has required massive volume repletion, resulting in an additional 30 liters of fluid intake. She remains on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to ongoing third-space fluid loss post-operatively. The chest X-ray shows mild pulmonary edema, indicating potential fluid overload. The patient may need to continue on mechanical ventilation until she starts auto-diuresis. Further volume repletion should be limited, and PR"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has received massive volume repletion but remains at risk for volume overload due to ongoing third-space fluid loss post-operatively. She also has pulmonary edema as shown on a chest X-ray and will need to remain on mechanical ventilation until she can auto-diurese. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, leading to concerns of volume overload. This can result in pulmonary edema, increased central venous pressure, and potential heart failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if she does not improve or if there are any complications related to the ventilator.
3. Infection: Given the patient's history of recurrent C. diff colitis, there is a risk of ongoing infection or the development of new infections while in the ICU.
4. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PT/INR indicates a potential bleeding risk, especially considering her history of taking Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (BP) readings indicate potential hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has been clinically stable without the need for vasopressors for over 24 hours. However, she has experienced massive volume overload and requires ongoing fluid restriction. The patient also has mild pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and should remain on mechanical ventilation until she begins to auto-diurese. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume overload: The patient has required massive volume repletion, leading to an excess of fluid accumulation. This can result in pulmonary edema and potentially cardiac issues.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff colitis, which can lead to severe diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infection.
3. Ischemic colitis: The patient's condition involves ischemic colitis, which can cause inflammation and damage to the colon. This may lead to perforation, peritonitis, or sepsis.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's pre-existing atrial fibrillation requires rate control, and there is a risk of thromboembolic events if anticoagulation is not managed appropriately.
5. Paralytic ileus: The patient has developed a paralytic ileus, characterized by the absence of bowel sounds and potential obstruction. This can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
6. Respiratory issues: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which carries its own risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy and is currently in the ICU. The patient is intubated and sedated. She has been diagnosed with volume overload and remains on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). She also has atrial fibrillation, for which she is being given metoprolol for rate control. Pain and sedation are managed with fentanyl and midazolam. The patient has a paralytic ileus and is being kept NPO. She has multiple lines and catheters in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
2. Bleeding: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a potential risk for bleeding, especially considering her use of Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's massive volume repletion has resulted in volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis, and underwent colectomy and ileostomy. She is currently intubated and sedated. The patient's current condition includes ischemic colitis/C. diff, volume overload, atrial fibrillation, pain control/sedation, feeding/enteral nutrition, post-procedure care, and access.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ischemic colitis/C. diff: The patient's recurrent C. diff infection and history of ischemic colitis pose a risk for further complications such as severe diarrhea, dehydration, and sepsis.
2. Volume overload: The patient has received massive volume repletion, leading to pulmonary edema as seen on chest X-ray. This can lead to respiratory distress and heart failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AFib needs to be closely monitored for potential complications like stroke or heart failure.
4. Pain control/sedation: The patient's pain management and sedation should be carefully monitored to avoid oversedation or inadequate pain control.
5. Feeding/enteral nutrition: Starting TPN is necessary, but there is a risk of complications such as infections or malnutrition.
6. Post-procedure care: The patient's surgical site needs to be monitored for any"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, presenting with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy and is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient has been receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation due to volume overload, with a total of 30 liters infused so far. She remains on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). Her vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and slightly elevated respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, distant heart sounds, and warm, dry extremities with 2+ pedal edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 74 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia (sodium 117 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (potassium 7.4 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (magnesium 1.7 mg/dL), and hypocalcemia (calcium 8.3 mg"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient is massively volume overloaded and shows signs of leukocytosis. She has been treated with IV antibiotics for C. diff and her blood pressure is currently stable without the need for pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff sepsis: The patient has recurrent C. diff infection, which can lead to severe colitis and potentially progress to sepsis.
2. Volume overload: The patient is massively volume overloaded, which increases the risk of congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and fluid accumulation in other organs.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypoperfusion and increased risk of organ damage. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid and vasopressor management are necessary.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to irregular heart rhythm and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.
5. Ischemic colitis: The patient has ischemic colitis, which can result in bowel necrosis and perforation if not managed promptly.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing other"

   24 Hour Events:
   TTE [**6-14**] - The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac index is
   borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. Cannot exclude mild aortic stenosis, but this does not
   appear to be severe. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-5-15**], the
   findings are similar.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has been volume overloaded, but is improving and no longer in shock. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff sepsis: The patient has a positive C. diff toxin and previous blood cultures were negative. She is receiving IV Flagyl for coverage and PR Vancomycin to treat the rectal mucosa.
2. Volume overload: The patient has a massive volume overload of approximately +25L and is beginning to autodiurese in response to lasix gtt. Aggressive diuresis is being continued prior to weaning off the ventilator.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to intravascular depletion and systemic inflammation. Lasix gtt should be down-titrated if the systolic blood pressure (SBP) is below 90 mmHg, and restarting pressors should be avoided.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient's heart rate is uncontrolled and needs rate control with lopressor 2.5 IV BID. Avoiding cardioversion is necessary due to the risk of holding ant"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient is massively volume overloaded and has leukocytosis. She is off pressors and afebrile, showing gradual improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. C. diff sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff infection, which can lead to severe colitis and potentially sepsis. She is being treated with IV Flagyl and PR vancomycin to address this.

2. Volume overload: The patient is massively volume overloaded, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. She is being treated with diuretics to manage this.

3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, likely due to intravascular volume depletion and systemic inflammation. She is being managed with aggressive diuresis and careful titration of medications such as lasix and versed.

4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient had a low-stim test, which does not suggest adrenal insufficiency. However, it should be considered if the patient has persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient is volume overloaded but improving, with leukocytosis likely due to rectal disease. She has been started on IV flagyl for C. diff coverage, IV cipro for coverage of gram-negative bacteria, and PR vancomycin to treat the rectal mucosa. The patient is also on contact precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff infection and is currently being treated with IV flagyl, cipro, and PR vancomycin. Close monitoring for signs of worsening sepsis is important.
2. Volume overload: The patient is massively volume overloaded, requiring aggressive diuresis with lasix. Continuous monitoring of fluid balance and vital signs is necessary to prevent further fluid overload.
3. Hypotension: The patient may experience hypotension due to intravascular depletion and systemic inflammation. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with lasix and pressors as needed are essential.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and rate control is important. Lopressor has been started IV q6 for rate control, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She presented with C. diff colitis following a colectomy and ileostomy. She is currently in the ICU for septic shock, likely due to C. diff infection. The patient's main concerns include volume overload, electrolyte imbalances (particularly hyponatremia), and atrial fibrillation. She is being treated with IV flagyl for C. diff coverage, IV vancomycin for rectal mucosa treatment, and IV cipro for gram-negative coverage. The patient is also on contact precautions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock due to the C. diff infection. It is crucial to continue aggressive treatment and monitoring.
2. Volume overload: The patient has been volume overloaded, resulting in a positive fluid balance. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent further fluid overload.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hyponatremia, which needs to be corrected carefully to avoid complications such as seizures or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which requires rate control and anticoagulation. It is important to avoid cardioversion due to the recent surgery.
5. C. diff recurrence: Although the patient is currently improving, there is a risk of"

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and has been massively volume overloaded. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff sepsis: The patient has recurrent C. diff infection, which can lead to colitis and sepsis. She is being treated with IV Flagyl for C. diff coverage and PR vancomycin to treat the rectal mucosa. Contact precautions have also been implemented.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be due to rectal disease. Blood and urine cultures should be recultured, and antibiotic changes should be held at this time.

3. Volume overload: The patient has a significant volume overload, with an estimated +25L loss of fluid. She is beginning to autodiurese and respond well to lasix gtt. Aggressive diuresis should continue prior to weaning, and lasix gtt should be titrated based on blood pressure.

4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to intravascular volume depletion secondary to systemic inflammation. Lasix gtt should be down-titrated if systolic"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy, is intubated and sedated, and is massively volume overloaded.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff sepsis: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and may still be at risk for complications related to C. diff infection, such as sepsis or bowel perforation.
2. Volume overload: The patient has been volume overloaded by approximately +25L. This can lead to respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and cardiac complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient may experience hypotension due to intravascular volume depletion from ongoing fluid losses and systemic inflammation. Close monitoring and careful management of fluid and vasopressor therapy will be necessary.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on coumadin for rate control. Close monitoring of heart rate and consideration for rate control medications will be needed.
5. Pain control/sedation: The patient requires ongoing pain management and sedation support to maintain comfort and prevent agitation while intubated.
6. Fever: The patient had low-grade fevers overnight, indicating possible ongoing infection or inflammation.
7. Antibiotic resistance: The patient's recent antibiotic"

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and hypertension, presenting with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, status post colectomy and ileostomy. She is currently intubated and sedated, and massively volume overloaded.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. C. diff sepsis: The patient has recurrent C. diff infection, which can lead to sepsis and potentially worsen her condition.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent leukocytosis, which could be due to an ongoing infection or inflammation. This needs to be monitored and further investigation may be required.

3. Volume overload: The patient is massively volume overloaded, with an estimated +25L loss of sodium. This can lead to fluid retention and potential complications such as heart failure or pulmonary edema.

4. Hypotension: The patient is at risk for hypotension, likely due to intravascular depletion and systemic inflammation. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management is necessary.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and her heart rate is currently uncontrolled. Rate control measures need to be implemented, and anticoagulation should be continued.

6. Pain control/sedation: The patient requires ongoing pain management and sedation due"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient is massively volume overloaded and has leukocytosis without fevers. Her blood cultures are negative, and she is being treated for C. diff sepsis with IV Flagyl, PR vancomycin, and IV ciprofloxacin. She also has leukocytosis that may be due to rectal disease, and her volume overload is being managed with aggressive diuresis using Lasix. The patient's hypotension is likely due to intravascular volume depletion secondary to systemic inflammation. She has atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 80-120 beats per minute, for which she will be started on low-dose ASA and have her lopressor dosage adjusted. Pain control and sedation are being provided through fentanyl and versed infusions. The patient's nutritional needs will be met through TPN, and she will have R ISS. She has a right internal jugular triple-lumen catheter and a left radial arterial line. Contact information for the healthcare provider is provided. The patient's code status is full code."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension, presenting with septic shock, ischemic colitis in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and subsequent colectomy and ileostomy. The patient is intubated and sedated, massively volume overloaded, and has been diagnosed with C. diff sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff Sepsis: The patient's current condition of C. diff sepsis poses a significant risk for complications such as multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. It is essential to continue with the prescribed treatment plan, which includes IV Flagyl for C. diff coverage, PR Vancomycin to treat rectal mucosa, and IV Cipro for coverage of gram-negative bacteria in the setting of gut translocation.

2. Volume Overload: The patient is massively volume overloaded, with a net loss of 2464 mL in 24 hours. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix gtt is recommended to achieve the goal of -2 to -2.5 L x 24 hours. Monitoring electrolytes and repleting as needed is crucial during diuresis.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, currently with a heart rate between 80-120 beats per minute. Rate control should be maintained with Lopid"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension. She was admitted with septic shock, ischemic colitis in the setting of recurrent C. diff, and underwent colectomy and ileostomy. The patient is intubated and sedated, and is described as massively volume overloaded.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. C. diff sepsis: The patient has recurrent C. diff, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent leukocytosis, which could be due to developing cellulitis around the wound or rectal disease. It is important to closely monitor the wound exam and reculture blood and urine to determine the cause of leukocytosis.

3. Volume overload: The patient is described as massively volume overloaded, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema and heart failure. Aggressive diuresis with lasix is being used to address this issue.

4. Hypotension: The patient has episodes of hypotension, which may be due to intravascular volume depletion secondary to systemic inflammation. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with fluids and vasopressors is necessary.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which needs to be rate-controlled. A change in medication"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to C. diff colitis post colectomy, respiratory failure secondary to volume overload, and septic shock. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has received multiple antibiotics for her conditions. She is also on medications for pain control, sedation, and rate control for her AFib. The patient has shown improvement in her volume overload with the use of Lasix and is expected to continue diuresing. Her leukocytosis has resolved, and she is no longer in shock. The patient's current goals include advancing her to tube feeds, discontinuing TPN when she reaches goal without residuals, monitoring her electrolytes, and repleting them as needed while diuresing. She will be closely monitored for any potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff sepsis: The patient has a history of C. diff colitis, which can lead to recurrent infections and sepsis. Close monitoring of her symptoms and continued treatment with appropriate antibiotics are necessary to prevent complications.
2. Volume overload: The patient has been volume overloaded, which can lead to respiratory distress and further complications. Monitoring her fluid balance and continuing with diuretic therapy will help prevent volume overload.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which can affect her overall health and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She presented with C. diff colitis post colectomy and ileostomy, respiratory failure secondary to volume overload, and septic shock. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, massively volume overloaded, but no longer in shock. She is afebrile and resolving leukocytosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff sepsis: The patient has a history of C. diff colitis and is currently on IV Flagyl for coverage. There is a risk of recurrent C. diff infection.
2. Volume overload: The patient has been diagnosed with volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
3. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypertension but is currently on hold due to sepsis. There is a risk of hypotension, especially if the patient is weaned off pressors.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of AFib and is on coumadin. There is a risk of recurrent AFib or worsening heart rate control.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is on medication for it. There is a risk of worsening symptoms or abnormal thyroid function.
6. Ischemic colitis: The patient has a history of ischem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and hypertension, presenting with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has been massively volume overloaded. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 101 F, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 96/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff sepsis and is being treated with IV Flagyl, PR vancomycin, and IV ciprofloxacin for gram-negative coverage. She is also on contact precautions. The patient's volume overload is being managed with Lasix gtt. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring daily chest X-rays and following up with blood, urine, and sputum cultures are important to detect early signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and volume overload can increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or subcutaneous heparin should be considered.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently low, and careful monitoring of fluid balance and medication adjustments are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's serum potassium, sodium, and chloride levels need to be monitored closely due to ongoing diuresis and fluid resuscitation.
5. Infection: The patient has multiple risk factors for infection, including prolonged immobility, invasive lines, and recent surgery. Regular assessment of vital signs, wound healing, and surveillance cultures will help identify any new infections promptly.
6. Delirium: Prolonged sedation and critical illness can lead to delirium. Frequent reassessment of mental status and appropriate pain and agitation management are important.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's current fluid overload needs to be carefully managed to prevent further complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure.
8. C. diff recurrence: The patient's recent history of C. diff infection increases the risk of recurrence. Proper hand hygiene, antibiotic stewardship, and use of probiotics can help reduce the risk of future episodes.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted with Clostridium difficile colitis and required a colectomy. She is now experiencing significant volume overload and ongoing respiratory failure, which is reversible with the management of the volume overload. The patient has had an endotracheal tube (ETT) in place for 11 days and needs to be weaned off mechanical ventilation as soon as possible. She also has atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, hypotension, and hyponatremia, which are being managed accordingly. The patient's mental status and agitation are also a concern, and minimal sedating medications will be used.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing ongoing respiratory failure due to volume overload. This needs to be managed promptly to improve oxygenation and prevent further complications.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock from C. diff infection, as indicated by the use of antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Flagyl) to treat the infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient has chronic hypertension but is currently holding medications while in sepsis. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent hypotension and its associated complications.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which requires ongoing management with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She was admitted with septic shock likely due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, ischemic colitis, and recurrent C. diff after undergoing colectomy and ileostomy. The patient is intubated and sedated, with poor diuresis despite receiving IV fluids. Possible postural systolic variation (PSV) trial today. The patient denies pain, fevers, or chills. Allergies include penicillins and Benadryl. She has received antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/60 mmHg to 131/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH 7.33, PaCO2 40 mmHg, PaO2 95 mmHg, HCO3- 29 mEq/L, and BE 0.8 mg/dL. Physical examination reveals bilateral breath sounds, regular heart rhythm with S1 and S2 sounds, and no murmurs or gallops. The abdomen is tender to palpation with staples intact, minimal erythema surrounding the staples, and patent ostomy with gas/stool in the bag. Extremities show warm, dry skin with edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count of 291 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 107 and 141 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia (sodium of 115 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (potassium of 3.7 mEq/L). Imaging reveals increased haziness in the right lower lobe of the lung, and microbiology tests confirm the presence of C. diff in the stool. The patient is diagnosed with sepsis likely from C. diff, diarrhea, hyponatremia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and recent septic shock due to C. diff infection. She is currently intubated and sedated, massively volume overloaded, and receiving IV fluids. The patient has been started on IV flagyl for C. diff coverage, PR vancomycin to treat the rectal mucosa, and IV ciprofloxacin for coverage of gram-negative bacteria. Contact precautions have been implemented. The patient's volume overload is being addressed with aggressive diuresis using furosemide. The goal is to achieve a daily fluid intake of 4-4.5 L and maintain a urine output of 200-250 mL/day. Low-grade fevers are being monitored, and daily chest X-rays will be compared to assess for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be obtained to determine the etiology of the low-grade fevers. The patient's atrial fibrillation will be managed with rate control using metoprolol, and she will be evaluated for restarting coumadin. Pain and sedation will be controlled using fentanyl and versed. The patient's nutrition will be provided through tube feeding at a rate of 35 mL/hour."

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension, who presented with septic shock secondary to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy for ischemic colitis. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and has been experiencing massive volume overload.

24-hour events include a positive spontaneous breathing trial (PSV trial) and fevers. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/60 mmHg to 131/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a weight gain of 25.5 kg since admission.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,437 mL including 697 mL through the oral route, 1,545 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 1,466 mL through intravenous fluids. The total output includes 5,280 mL of blood products, 2,210 mL of urine, and 1,513 mL of drainage. The patient has a negative fluid balance of 843 mL.

The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain control, respectively. Furosemide (Lasix) is being administered"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female who underwent a colectomy due to severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She is currently in the ICU on day 11 post-operation and is experiencing respiratory failure, fever, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support, aggressive diuretics, and antibiotics for C. diff. She has a history of allergies to penicillins and is unable to provide her own medical history as she is sedated. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/54-81/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her current weight is 120.5 kg, and she has been receiving tube feeds and IV fluids. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range, but she has a slightly low albumin level. The patient has been experiencing recurrent fevers, fluid overload, and has shown improvement in her white blood cell count with current antibiotic treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. It is crucial to monitor her RSBI ("

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension. She was admitted with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient underwent colectomy and ileostomy, and is now on day 11 in the ICU. She is intubated and sedated, and has been massively volume overloaded. Her vital signs are currently stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/35-156/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient is being treated for C. diff sepsis with IV flagyl, vancomycin for rectal mucosa, and ciprofloxacin for gram-negative coverage. She is also on contact precautions. The volume overload is being managed with lasix gtt, and the goal is to achieve a daily fluid balance of -4 to -4.5 liters. Low-grade fevers have been present, but there is no evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) at this time.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with lopressor 12.5 po BID for rate control, and she will be followed up with surgery regarding restarting coumadin. Pain control and sedation are being"

Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension. She was admitted with septic shock, ischemic colitis in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and underwent a colectomy and ileostomy. The patient has been intubated and sedated since POD #11 and is massively volume overloaded.

Assessment and Plan:
1. C. diff sepsis: The patient is no longer in shock, off pressors, afebrile, and resolving leukocytosis. Treatment includes IV flagyl for C. diff coverage, PR vancomycin to treat rectal mucosa, and IV cipro for coverage of gram-negative bacteria in the setting of gut translocation.
2. Volume overload: The patient has a significant volume overload with approximately +16L lost. Treatment involves continuous volume control ventilation, aggressive diuresis prior to weaning, and lasix gtt as tolerated. The goal is to maintain a daily fluid intake of 4-4.5L.
3. Low-grade fevers: The patient had low-grade fevers, but none were recorded overnight. There is no evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) at this time. Further evaluation includes following blood, urine, sputum cultures"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure. She has been tolerating diuresis and partial support ventilation (PSV) well. Her creatinine levels are stable, indicating successful fluid removal. She is currently receiving antibiotics for Clostridium difficile infection, and her blood culture results are pending. The plan is to continue diuresis as tolerated, with a trial of PSV weaning today. If well tolerated, she will be moved to extubation. Diuretics may need to be managed carefully due to metabolic alkalosis, which can impair respiratory drive. The patient's sodium levels have improved with intravenous fluids. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin. Her blood pressure is under control, and she has chronic hypertension but is currently not on medication. She also has hypothyroidism. In terms of ICU care, she is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and regular insulin for glycemic control. She has a urinary catheter and is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Her code status is full code, and she will remain in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial condition was respiratory failure, which has been managed with PSV support. However, there is a potential complication of weaning off the ventilator successfully without any adverse events"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy on POD #11 and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been experiencing volume overload, which has been managed with lasix gtt. Her respiratory support has been weaned to PSV with a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 69. The patient is also receiving sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab values, including kidney and liver function tests, are within normal ranges.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Volume overload: The patient has been responding well to lasix gtt, and her sedation will be lightened to improve respiratory drive. She will continue on PSV mode with a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg. The goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of 2-2.5 liters over the next 24 hours, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be considered in the morning.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: Aggressive loop diuretics have"

The patient is a critically ill 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, who is currently in the ICU. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy due to ischemic colitis in the setting of recurrent C. difficile infection. The patient's chief complaints include volume overload with subsequent ventilator dependence, C. difficile colitis, and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/48 to 152/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.2 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 108 mg/dL, elevated creatinine at 0.8 mg/dL, and an elevated lactate level of 0.8 mmol/L.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including C. diff colitis, volume overload, septic shock, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient underwent a colectomy and ileostomy 11 days ago and has been on mechanical ventilation since then. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 105/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is expected to undergo extubation today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has been diagnosed with volume overload, which is a common complication in critically ill patients. This condition can lead to pulmonary edema, worsening heart failure, and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. The patient is currently being treated with diuretics to manage this condition.

2. C. diff Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff sepsis, a severe infection caused by Clostridium difficile bacteria. This infection can lead to colitis and systemic complications, including septic shock. The patient is receiving antibiotics (flagyl and vancomycin) to treat the infection.

3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are C. diff colitis post colectomy, volume overload with subsequent vent dependence, and held tube feeds at midnight for possible extubation today. The patient has allergies to penicillins and experiences hives as a reaction. The patient has been on various antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), a heart rate of 85 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 105/48 to 152/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 120.5 kg, which is an increase from their admission weight of 95 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,618 mL of fluids, with 416 mL being given through the tube feeds, 1,447 mL through IV fluids, and 820 mL through other sources. The total output includes 5,290 mL of blood products and 1,115 mL of urine. The patient has a negative fluid balance of -2,672 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 94, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 15 cmH2O, and the spontaneous tidal volume is 396 mL.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 24.2 K/uL, slightly elevated hematocrit (Hct) of 30.9%, and platelet count (Plt) of 487 K/uL. Other lab results include blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 108 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.8 mg/dL, glucose of 132 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances such as low sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-). The patient also has elevated levels of lactate acid, LDH, and liver enzymes.

Microbiology tests indicate the presence of yeast in the urine and a rare gram-negative rod (GNR) in the sputum. Blood cultures are pending.

The patient's medical conditions include shock, sepsis likely from C. diff, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and volume overload. The patient is also on medication for atrial fibrillation, pain control, and sedation.

The plan includes continuing IV flagyl for C. diff coverage, PR vancomycin to treat rectal mucosa, and discontinuing central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. The patient's sedation will be light"

","Summary:
The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU due to C. diff colitis post colectomy and ileostomy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to volume overload. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/48 to 152/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, obesity, soft abdomen with bowel sounds, and peripheral edema. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 24.2, elevated creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 122 mEq/L. The patient's blood cultures are pending. The assessment and plan include shock and sepsis likely from C. diff, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient's current goals include weaning off mechanical ventilation, correcting volume overload, managing electrolyte imbalances, and treating C. diff infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis ("

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with C. Diff and now s/p colectomy and has reasonable
   diuresis in the setting of clinical improvement and has had good
   tolerance of PSV weaning to date.  Her tachypnea and tachycardia during
   the SBT may well be a manifestation of some evidence of centralization
   of fluid with PEEP removal and this may suggest ongoing diuresis if
   possible would be of interest.  She has had some significant
   improvement in her metabolic state and what may well have been a
   metabolic alkalosis impairing respiratory drive has largely improved.
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
   -likely from C. diff--Flagyl IV, vanco PR
   -Cipro to D/C tomorrow
   -Hemodynamics now notable for tachycardia
   Respiratory Failure-
   She has persistent volume overload (CXR and SBT failure) which may be
   driving of the compromised respiratory status.  SBT failure was defined
   by tachycardia/hypertension.  In addition she has some component of
   anxiety which is driving some of the tachypnea but the extent to which
   this is a complete answer is unclear.
   [**Name2 (NI) **]
   -diurese 2 liters today
   -Fentanyl PRN for pain
   -Haldol [**Hospital1 **] for anxiety/agitation
   -She has had reasonable stability with PSV and hope to move towards
   optimal fluid status and trial of extubation tomorrow.
   -Lasix for diuresis after second day of diamox.
   -Will repeat SBT this afternoon after further optimization of above
   -Trach and PEG on Monday if not successful in extubation this
   week/weekend

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, sepsis, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She underwent a colectomy and has shown reasonable diuresis with clinical improvement. The patient has been tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) weaning well but experiences tachypnea and tachycardia during spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). These symptoms may indicate ongoing fluid overload and compromise respiratory status.

The patient has a history of shock and septicemia, likely due to C. diff infection, for which she has been receiving Flagyl IV and vancomycin. Her hemodynamics are notable for tachycardia. She also has persistent volume overload as evidenced by chest X-ray and SBT failure, which may be driving her compromised respiratory status. Additionally, there is a component of anxiety contributing to the tachypnea.

The plan includes continuing diuretic therapy, providing pain relief with fentanyl PRN, and managing anxiety with Haldol. The goal is to optimize fluid status and attempt extubation tomorrow. If extubation is unsuccessful, tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may be considered on Monday.

The patient also has other medical conditions such as diarrhea, hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension, and hypothy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy and has been in the ICU for POD #13. Her volume status has improved with diuresis but she remains unable to wean off the ventilator. She is currently experiencing agitation and fever, along with leukocytosis. Potential sources of fever/leukocytosis include line infection, recurrent colitis, abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, urinary tract infection, and sinusitis. A CT torso with contrast is planned to evaluate these possibilities.

The patient has been on aggressive loop diuresis due to metabolic alkalosis. Her potassium levels are being monitored and she is receiving potassium chloride as needed. She is also receiving IV flagyl for Clostridium difficile coverage and PR vancomycin to treat the rectal mucosa. Contact precautions have been implemented.

The patient's heart rate is reasonably well-controlled and she is being started on lopressor 12.5 po BID for rate control. She will be monitored for any signs of tracheal irritation before considering systemic anticoagulation.

Pain control and sedation have been managed with fentanyl and versed gtt, but these will be stopped and fentanyl boluses will be used for pain control"

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, and had undergone colectomy and ileostomy. The patient's current condition includes failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, fever, leukocytosis, volume overload, metabolic alkalosis, and Clostridium difficile colitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Line infection: The patient has multiple lines, including a central venous catheter that needs to be replaced on day 15. This raises concern for a line infection as a possible source of fever and leukocytosis.

2. Recurrent colitis: The patient has a history of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, which can lead to complications such as severe colitis and toxic megacolon.

3. Abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal status should be closely monitored for any signs of abscess formation due to the previous surgery and ongoing infection.

4. Acalculous cholecystitis: This condition is a potential complication in critically ill patients, especially those receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation. It is characterized by gallbladder stasis and inflammation without the presence of gallstones.

5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urinary catheter needs to be monitored for signs of infection, which can cause fever and leukoc"

   85 y/o female h/o AFib and HTN a/w septic shock, ischemic colitis in
   the setting of recurrent C. diff, POD #12 s/p colectomy & ileostomy,
   clinically improved but volume overload remaining a barrier to
   extubation.
   #Volume overload - +9L  LOS, responding well to lasix gtt
   -defer extubation today due to failed SBT; continue on PSV.  Lighten
   sedation as best as possible and correct underlying alkalosis to
   improve resp. drive f/b repeat ABG

   #Met alkalosis - [**1-7**] aggressive loop diuresis, likely chloride
   responsive
   -stop lasix gtt, give diamox 250 IV x 1
   -give KCl prn, goal KCL > 4.5
   -repeat ABG when K at goal

   #C. diff sepsis
 Clinically no longer in shock, off pressors,
   afebrile, resolving leukocytosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy on POD #12 and has been improving clinically. However, the patient still has volume overload, which is hindering extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient's current condition indicates volume overload, as evidenced by a positive fluid balance of +9L. This can lead to pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further compromise respiratory function.

2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to aggressive loop diuresis. This condition can cause neuromuscular irritability, tetany, and even seizures if not corrected promptly.

3. Clostridium difficile Sepsis: Although the patient is no longer in shock and is off pressors, there is still a risk of recurrent C. diff infection. This can lead to worsening sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke. Rate control measures are in place, but the patient may require anticoagulation after extubation.

5. Pain Control/Sedation: The patient's pain is"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female admit with C. Diff colitis and now s/p colectomy who has
   had ongoing management of respiratory failure and is complicated by
   some volume overload, some significant atrial tachycardia and now with
   recurrent fevers overnight.

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
   likely from C. diff; post-op
   Patient now with recurrent fevers noted and source of infection not
   clear
   -Will pursue
   -Cipro/Flagyl with Cipro planned to be discontinued today
   -Vanco PR and Flagyl IV to continue
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   She has ongoing issues of altered mental status but the most concerning
   acute issue is the evolution of new fever.  Will move to continue full
   support and the patient will likely need trach and PEG based upon
   current clinical course and compromised status.
   -Maintain full ventilatory support today
   -Metabolic alkalosis resolved
   -Will continue with Haldol titration and consider propofol appropriate
   for short term support but should prolonged course be expected will
   move to Versed/Fentanyl
   FEVER-
   -Will need CT torso
   -Will add CT head for sinusitis in the setting of NGT
   -Will change CVL with new site if alternative source not clearly
   defined
   -Will consider antibiotic choice based upon review of studies and
   consideration of bandemia
   -Will pursue bronchoscopy with BAL if infiltrates persist or are
   evolving for possible VAP
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   on coumadin as out-pt; waiting to restart until extubated
   Will need persistent and improved rated control--Lopressor
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   chronic; on low dose metoprolol post-op; will ptitrate

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) colitis and subsequently underwent a colectomy. The patient continues to experience respiratory failure and has developed recurrent fevers overnight.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's recurrent fevers and ongoing management of respiratory failure may indicate a possible septic shock, likely from C. diff infection. Immediate intervention is required to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ongoing issues with altered mental status and compromised respiratory function. It is recommended to maintain full ventilatory support and consider tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for long-term support.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's recurrent fevers overnight require further investigation to determine the source of infection. A CT torso and CT head should be performed to assess for any potential infections such as sinusitis. Additionally, changing the central venous line (CVL) with a new site may be necessary if an alternative source of infection is not clearly defined.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is on coumadin as an outpatient and will need restarting once extubated. Improved rate control can be achieved with Lopressor.

5. Hypertension: The patient has chronic hypertension and is on low-dose metop"

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy on POD #13 and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's recent progress includes improved volume status with diuresis but failure to wean from mechanical ventilation and new-onset fever and leukocytosis. Her current vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 94/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has multiple medical complications and potential sources of infection, including line infection, recurrent colitis, abdominal abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), sinusitis, and fever of unknown origin (FUO) with possible pulmonary embolism (PE) or drug reaction. Empirical vancomycin was started for a presumed line infection, and the central line was changed. Blood and urine cultures are pending.

The patient's failure to wean from mechanical ventilation may be attributed to agitation, volume overload, and respiratory acidosis. She is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, which improved with potassium"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient underwent a colectomy and ileostomy on POD #14. Despite improvements in volume status with diuresis, the patient remains unable to wean from mechanical ventilation and has developed a fever and leukocytosis, suggesting a possible central line infection. The patient's C. diff colitis has been treated with surgical therapy and antibiotic therapy, including IV flagyl and oral vancomycin. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with rate control medications, and low-dose aspirin is being given for her history of coronary artery disease. The patient's pain and sedation needs are being addressed with fentanyl and versed infusions. The patient's potassium levels are being monitored and repleted as necessary. The patient's family has been involved in care discussions, and the patient's code status remains as full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central line infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate a central line infection. The current treatment plan includes changing the central line and continuing empiric coverage for presumed line infection.
2. Failure to wean: The patient's inability to wean from mechanical ventilation may be due to several factors, including agitation, volume overload,"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and hypertension, who underwent a colectomy and ileostomy due to recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload. The patient was previously intubated but has been extubated and is now on high-flow facemask oxygen. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/46 mmHg to 140/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 95 kg at admission to 120.5 kg currently. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,830 mL and output of 2,840 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,010 mL. The patient's lungs are described as having mild labored breathing with coarse breath sounds diffusely. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.4 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, low albumin level of 1.7 g/dL, and elevated lactate level of 0.8 mmol/L. The patient's potassium, sodium, and magnesium levels are within normal range. 

The patient has multiple pending lab tests including blood culture, urine culture, and yeast culture. 

Potential medical complications:

1. Shock, septic: The patient is suspected to have septic shock, likely from C. diff infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib and is currently on coumadin. Restarting anticoagulation may be considered after extubation.
3. Hypertension: The patient has chronic hypertension, which is currently being managed with low-dose metoprolol.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a noted problem of hypothyroidism but lacks detailed information regarding this condition.
5. Fluid overload: The patient is volume overloaded, as indicated by the negative fluid balance and increased weight. This can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
6. Failure to wean: The patient has difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation, which can be due to several factors such as agitation, volume overload, or unresolved metabolic alkalosis.
7. C. diff colitis: The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff infection, and appropriate antibiotics and contact precautions are being implemented to manage this condition.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who underwent a colectomy and ileostomy. She has been experiencing respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload and is currently on high-flow facemask ventilation. The patient has a past medical history of ischemic colitis and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She is also experiencing volume overload with a positive fluid balance of +6L. The patient's leukocyte count has been elevated, indicating a possible infection. She has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis and is being treated with antibiotics. The patient is also being closely monitored for line infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia. She is still tachycardic with an irregular rhythm and her blood pressure is within the normal range. The patient's pain is well-controlled, and she is receiving appropriate nutrition and glycemic control. She has multiple lines inserted, including a central line, and is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload indicates a high risk for further respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia.
2. Infection: The elevated leukocyte count suggests an ongoing infection, possibly related to the central line or urinary tract. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who was admitted with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She underwent colectomy and ileostomy on post-operative day (POD) #14. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload, and despite being extubated yesterday, she is still on non-invasive ventilation support.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 109 bpm with an irregular rhythm, blood pressure of 113/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent. Her weight has increased from 95 kg at admission to 120.5 kg currently. The fluid balance shows an intake of 1,830 mL and output of 2,840 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,010 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and decreased hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL. The blood cultures are pending, and the urine culture shows yeast >100,000. Imaging studies, such as a CT torso, have not revealed any significant findings.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) colitis who has undergone a colectomy. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure and fluid overload, as well as atrial tachycardia. The patient had recurrent fevers and leukocytosis but these resolved after the removal of a central line and administration of vancomycin. She was extubated yesterday and is now on minimal nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's primary issues include shock and sepsis, which have been resolved, respiratory failure, effusions, fever, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She also has a yeast urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still at risk for respiratory failure due to ongoing fluid overload and effusions. Close monitoring of respiratory status and continued use of diuretics to manage fluid balance is essential.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed with appropriate antiarrhythmic medication. The patient's medication regimen includes metoprolol and potentially restarting Coumadin for stroke prevention.

3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that may require adjustment of her medication regimen, particularly considering the potential for IV administration due to swallow assessment.

4. Yeast UTI: The patient has a yeast urinary tract infection, which requires prompt management with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted with Clostridium difficile colitis and subsequently underwent colectomy. The patient developed respiratory failure and fluid overload, leading to extubation yesterday. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, a history of AMS (acute mental status changes), and atrial tachycardia.

24-hour events include the extubation of the patient, administration of Lasix, and changes in medication infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/52 to 104/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases, warm skin without jaundice, and purposeful movement.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient is recovering from colectomy for C. diff colitis and has developed respiratory failure.
2. The patient had recurrent fevers and leukocytosis but resolved after line removal and administration of vancomycin.
3. The patient was extubated yesterday"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, who is currently in the ICU for septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy on POD #14. The patient's volume status has improved with diuretics but is still experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator and has developed a fever. The patient also has leukocytosis, indicating an elevated white blood cell count. The patient's current medications include captopril, metronidazole, vancomycin, lisinopril, aspirin, and coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has been diagnosed with volume overload, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and other organs. This can result in pulmonary edema, decreased cardiac output, and respiratory distress.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to C. diff infection. This condition can cause low blood pressure, inadequate tissue perfusion, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not promptly treated.
3. Ischemic Colitis: The patient has ischemic colitis, which is inflammation of the colon caused by inadequate blood flow. This condition can lead to abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and infection.
4. Recurrent C. diff Infection: The patient has a recurrent C. diff infection,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, presenting with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy on POD #16 and has been experiencing volume overload and leukocytosis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 161/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Physical examination reveals end-expiratory rhonchi, rapid heart rate, regular rhythm, and minimal erythema at the surgical incision site. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and decreased hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL. The patient has been on various medications including vancomycin, metronidazole, captopril, and lisinopril. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume overload: The patient is experiencing volume overload as indicated by the increased weight and fluid balance. This can lead to congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which indicates an increased white blood cell count. This may suggest an ongoing infection or inflammatory"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female admit with C.Diff and s/p colectomy now has had
   improvement in volume overload and respiratory failure now has
   tolerated extubation over this past weekend.  She has not had recurrent
   fevers in the setting of line change and antibiotic changes.
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
   likely from C. diff; post-op and improved hemodynamics
   -Patient currently on Flagyl/Vanco PR and Vanco IV
   -Recurrent fever, WBC count may well have been related to CVL
would
   favor 7d treatment in setting of line change
   -Improved hemodynamics at this time
   -Keep even or positive volume status in setting of resolving sepsis
   Respiratory Failure-
   -Successful extubation, will need to get OOB to chair and begin PT
   program to mobilize and optimize respiratory status.
   -Supervised feeds as aspiration risk is probably primary barrier
   -Volume status is near euvolemic and would not favor further diruesis
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   on coumadin as out-pt; waiting to restart until extubated
   Lopressor and ASA
   Hold anti-coagulation until extubation successful
will have to be a

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and post-colectomy status. She has shown improvement in volume overload and respiratory failure, tolerating extubation over the past weekend. There are no recurrent fevers after line and antibiotic changes. The patient is currently on Flagyl/Vanco PR and Vanco IV. Her hemodynamics have improved, indicating likely resolution of septic shock. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure, which could have been life-threatening if not appropriately managed through mechanical ventilation and subsequent extubation.
3. C. diff Infection: The patient had an active C. diff infection, which can cause severe diarrhea, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of complications such as sepsis.
4. Volume Overload: The patient was initially volume overloaded, which can lead to pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular instability.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has AF, which increases the risk of stroke and the need for anticoagulation management.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, requiring lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
7. Hypertension: The patient has chronic hypertension, which needs to"

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who presented with septic shock, ischemic colitis, and recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She underwent a colectomy and ileostomy on POD #16 and has been in the ICU since then. The patient's current complaints include volume overload and tachycardia.

Upon reviewing the patient's vital signs, it is noted that her temperature is within normal range, but her heart rate is elevated at 101 beats per minute. Her blood pressure is 139/54 mmHg, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1020 mL, indicating volume overload. Her weight has increased from 95 kg at admission to 120.5 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.5 K/uL. Her hemoglobin level is 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count is 840 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal ranges.

Imaging studies reveal a 7 mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe, an angiomyolipoma of the right kidney, and fibroid uterus with extensive calcification.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who experienced septic shock, ischemic colitis in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and underwent colectomy and ileostomy on post-operative day (POD) #16. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.

The patient's current chief complaint is volume overload after the colectomy. The 24-hour events include the collection of blood cultures, tachycardia that responded minimally to fluid bolus and increased lopressor (metoprolol), and being out of bed to a chair.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and hives, and has received vancomycin and metronidazole recently. She is currently on several medications, including lorazepam (Ativan), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (Lasix), and others.

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 139/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation.

   85 y/o female h/o AFib and HTN a/w septic shock, ischemic colitis in
   the setting of recurrent C. diff, POD #16 s/p colectomy & ileostomy,
   volume status improved with diuresis but failure to wean and new fever,
   leukocytosis.
   #Fever/leukocytosis
 WBC down, has not been febrile since AM [**6-23**];
   suspect transient bacteremia from central line; CT torso unrevealing;
   also consider sinusitis, UTI; fever also invokes PE, drug rxn (but
   should not cause leukocytosis)
   -cont. vanco IV for presumed line infection until culture data avail.
   but will decrease dose to 750 mg Q12 due to 2 high vanco trough levels
   in a row.
   -IV flagyl on board for c. diff; consider broading ABX for cov
g gram
   neg (and re-culture) if fever recurs
   -central line changed [**6-23**]; old line tip Cx pending
   -blood, urine Cx pending
   #Volume overload - +4L  [**Location 3741**] actually appears a little dry on exam today
   -goal even for today.
   #Tachycardia
 most likely due to volume depletion.
   - IVF bolus to see HR responsive to fluids.
   - increase dose of lopressor to 37.5 mg today.
   #C. diff colitis
 s/p definitive surgical therapy
   -IV flagyl (day 15) for c. diff cov

   -lopressor tritrate to 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] today.
   -low-dose ASA for h/o CAD
   -surgery does not wish to restart coumadin.  Patient should have
   coumadin restarted prior to d/c.
   - pt on lisinopril at home; will titrate low dose captopril to
   determine lisinopril dosage

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who experienced septic shock, ischemic colitis in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and underwent a colectomy and ileostomy. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications and conditions.

The patient's chief complaint is volume overload after the colectomy. The note mentions increased use of Lopressor, a medication used to lower blood pressure and control heart rate. The patient also has allergies to penicillins and has received vancomycin and metronidazole, which are antibiotics commonly used for treating C. diff infections.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/54 mmHg to 164/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient's weight has increased from 95 kg at admission to 120.5 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,440 mL with 255 mL coming from IV fluids, 90 mL through enteral nutrition (PO), and 10 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TF). The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, who underwent a colectomy and ileostomy due to recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and ischemic colitis. She is currently in the ICU for septic shock, which may be related to C. diff, and has been experiencing volume overload post-operation. She also has hypertension and hypothyroidism. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medication. Her current medications include lorazepam, heparin sodium, and metoprolol. The patient is also experiencing tremors and has difficulty with fine motor movements in her hands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's symptoms of fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible ongoing infection, which can lead to septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Volume overload: The patient's weight gain and fluid balance indicate that she is likely experiencing volume overload, which can be dangerous and require immediate attention.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient's history of AFib and the persistent tachycardia despite medication adjustments indicate that her heart rhythm may continue to be unstable.
4. Ischemic colitis: The patient's initial condition of ischemic colitis could potentially lead to further complications if not adequately treated.
5. C. diff infection: Although the patient has undergone definitive surgical therapy for C."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female now with improved hemodynamic stability and improved
   respiratory status with diuresis.
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
   likely from C. diff; post-op
   -Vanco(IV)/Flagyl(IV)
   Tachypnea-
   -Patient with some baseline tachypnea now--this is likely related to
   some component of volume overload and persistence of some significant
   respiratory secretions.
   -Lasix to maintain negative fluid balance
   -Chest PT and will have to remain with supplmental O2 in place.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   on coumadin as out-pt; waiting to restart until extubated
   -Will need continued rate control
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   chronic; on low dose metoprolol post-op; will ptitrate

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been in the ICU and has shown improvement in hemodynamic stability and respiratory status with diuresis. The patient is suspected to have C. diff infection as a likely cause of post-operative shock.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis and is suspected to have a C. diff infection. There is a risk of developing further infections due to the immunocompromised state caused by sepsis and antibiotic usage.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is mentioned as 165/72 mmHg, which is high. There is a risk of hypertensive emergency or uncontrolled hypertension leading to organ damage.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient is on supplemental oxygen and has diminished breath sounds. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or failure due to volume overload, respiratory secretions, or underlying lung pathology.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is diagnosed with AFib and is on coumadin. There is a risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke if not adequately anticoagulated or rate-controlled.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is reported to have hypothyroidism, but no further details are provided. It is important to monitor thyroid function and manage it appropriately"
