","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD presenting with feeling unwell, chest pain, and shock. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires emergent dialysis.

The patient has been started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to renal failure. There is a concern for a possible biliary source of sepsis, and an abdominal ultrasound is planned to evaluate this further. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, and the source of infection remains unclear.

The patient's hemodynamics are unstable, with low blood pressure and a need for vasopressor support using Levophed. The patient's oxygenation is good, but there are concerns about potential complications such as ARDS or a cardiac event like a heart attack or valvular disease.

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, with prolonged PT and PTT.

The plan is to continue aggressive hemodynamic management, including fluid boluses and close monitoring of cardiac output. The patient will undergo various diagnostic tests, including blood cultures, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, echocardiogram, and CT scans. Medications such as antibiotics, vasopressors, and dialysis will be continued.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, septic shock, pneumonia complications, cardiac events,"

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow and agree
   substantially with the assessment and plan as above with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   Overnight, remains vasopressor-dependent but perfusion improved.
   T: 95    P:  104    BP: 102/52     Oxygen Saturation:  100   %  on
   mechanical ventilation with Fio2 of  .4  and PEEP of 5
   General: Intubated, sedated
   Chest: CTA bilaterally
   Heart: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: Soft NT ND
   Ext: Mottling has improved, no edema
   Labs: reviewed and as above
   CXR: Endotracheal tube is in good position, upper lobe infiltrate and
   likely RML infiltrate
   Assessment:
   1)      Shock
 Physiology plus hypothermia/elevated WBC most
   consistent with septic shock.  In terms of source, the most likely is
   pneumonia but the chest radiograph is not overly impressive and given
   the severity of his illness, I believe that evaluating other sources
   with a CT of the torso is necessary.
   2)      Acute Respiratory Failure
   3)      Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   4)
   Plan:
   1)      Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   2)      ECHO for function, evaluation of right heart but also to rule
   out endocarditis
   3)      Bedside ultrasound of the kidneys and gallbladder
   4)      If ECHO and ultrasound unrevealing in terms of source of
   sepsis, will check CT scan of torso
   5)      Continue resuscitation as dictated by perfusion endpoints
   6)      Check cortisol level
   Addendum: ECHO with no vegetations and mildly depressed LV, US
   negative, and CT scan consistent with pneumonia and no other sources of
   sepsis identified.  Cortisol level 12.  Will provide hydrocortisone and

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD, presenting with feeling unwell, chest pain, and shock. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely related to pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with excellent oxygenation. He is vasopressor-dependent but showing improved perfusion. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he is experiencing acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical intervention. Continued monitoring and management of hemodynamics, fluid balance, and organ perfusion are essential.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to mental status depression associated with shock. Monitoring of oxygenation and peak pressures is necessary to assess for the development of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, possibly exacerbated by the current shock state. Close monitoring of urine output and continued aggressive hemodynamic management are necessary. Renal replacement therapy may be required.

4. Pneumonia: The patient's chest radiograph shows signs of pneumonia, which is the most likely source of sepsis. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on culture results, and additional imaging studies may be needed to evaluate the extent of lung involvement.

5. Missed STEMI and resulting VSD:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD, presenting with symptoms of feeling unwell, chest pain, and shock. He has been admitted to the ICU for emergent dialysis and is currently on multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, calcium gluconate (CRRT), norepinephrine, meperidine, and lorazepam. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and a low respiratory rate. His oxygen saturation is 100% on endotracheal tube ventilation. The patient has been placed on CRRT, and various lines and catheters have been inserted for monitoring and treatment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of feeling unwell, chest pain, and shock, along with leukocytosis and rigors, suggests a possible infection leading to sepsis. This is supported by the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and blood cultures being obtained.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's mental status depression and need for mechanical ventilation indicate respiratory failure. The ARDS net ventilation suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can occur as a complication of sepsis.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's anterior Q waves and STE (ST-segment elevation) raise concern for a possible myocardial infarction leading to cardiogenic shock. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram is planned to rule out right"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with feeling unwell, chest pain, and shock. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, possibly related to pneumonia, and is currently being treated with aggressive hemodynamic management. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ dysfunction. Prompt identification and treatment are crucial.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Due to the patient's respiratory failure and shock, there is a risk of developing ARDS, a condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and impaired oxygenation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has exacerbation of renal failure in the setting of shock. Aggressive hemodynamic management and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) are being continued to support kidney function.
4. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has anterior Q waves and STE, indicating a possible missed STEMI. This increases the risk of complications such as heart failure, ventricular septal defect (VSD), or cardiogenic shock.
5. Biliary Sepsis: An abdominal ultrasound is planned to evaluate for biliary source of sepsis. Biliary sepsis can lead to"

   3)      Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   4)      Relative Adrenal Insufficiency
   Plan:
   1)      Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia
   2)      Will discontinue standing fluids and follow perfusion endpoints
   with regards to more fluids or consideration of diuresis
   3)      Continue hydrocortisone
   4)      Change to pressure support ventilation
   Addendum: Required cardioversion twice during rounds for SVT.  Patient
   cardioverted without complication.
   Time Spent: 90 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD, who presented with chest pain and developed septic shock. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring multiple interventions including the administration of adenosine for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and transition from levophed to neosynephrine for blood pressure support. The patient also received hydrocortisone for suspected relative adrenal insufficiency. Imaging studies revealed right upper lobe consolidation and left upper lobe ground glass opacity, consistent with pneumonia. The patient's renal function has worsened, leading to acute on chronic renal failure. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 112/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and a sinus bradycardia rhythm. The patient remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation, hypotension, and organ dysfunction. It is caused by a severe infection, in this case, pneumonia.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation. Respiratory failure can occur due to pneumonia-related"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD who presented with chest pain and developed septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, indicated by right upper lobe consolidation and left upper lobe ground glass opacity on a CT scan. Echocardiogram did not show vegetations. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable on neosynephrine. The patient's sputum gram stain revealed 2+ GNRs and GPCs, indicating a gram-negative bacterial infection. The patient is receiving empirical antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam, azithromycin, and vancomycin. Hydrocortisone has been initiated for adrenal insufficiency and will be tapered off tomorrow. The patient remains stable on current ventilator settings. There is a concern for renal failure, exacerbated by shock, and the patient's baseline creatinine level was 2.0. CVVH has been discontinued, and the patient's renal function will continue to be monitored. The patient's respiratory status is stable on FiO2 40 and PEEP 5. Consideration for extubation will be made when the patient is hemodynamically stable."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with chest pain and developed septic shock. The patient had a CT torso indicating right upper lobe consolidation and left upper lobe ground glass opacity. An echocardiogram was negative for vegetations. The patient has been hemodynamically stable on neo-synephrine overnight.

The patient's sputum gram stain showed 2+ Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci, suggesting a possible bacterial infection. Empiric antibiotic therapy has been initiated with piperacillin-tazobactam, azithromycin, and vancomycin.

The patient also has pneumonia, renal failure, and respiratory failure. The renal failure is likely an exacerbation of the patient's underlying chronic kidney disease due to the shock. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) was discontinued as the patient's creatinine level improved and urine output increased.

The respiratory failure is related to mental status depression caused by the shock. The patient's respiratory status is currently stable on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and slightly low calcium levels.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD who presented with chest pain and developed septic shock. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to mental status depression with shock. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not respond to treatment or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Renal failure: The patient has an unclear history of chronic kidney disease and is now experiencing an exacerbation in the setting of shock. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease.
3. Cardiovascular complications: Given the patient's septic shock and the use of vasopressors, there is a risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient is already infected with GNRs and GPCs, as indicated by the sputum gram stain. There is a risk of secondary infections, including VAP, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobilization and bed rest in the ICU can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
6. Ventilator-associated events: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated events such as VAP,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple health issues. They have experienced episodes of cardiac dysrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and supraventricular tachycardia. The patient required cardioversion on multiple occasions to restore normal sinus rhythm. They also underwent invasive ventilation but were extubated as they showed improvement. The patient's mental status remains altered, but they are conversant and oriented.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is being treated with medications such as pantoprazole and piperacillin. There is a concern for sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and supraventricular tachycardia indicates an ongoing risk of arrhythmias. This can lead to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and potentially cardiac arrest.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleed suggests a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing bleeding. This can lead to hypotension, anemia, and potential organ dysfunction.

3. Sepsis: The presence of multiple infections (sputum and stool cultures) and the patient's altered mental status indicate a high possibility of sepsis. Sepsis can progress to septic shock, organ dysfunction, and potentially death"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presenting with chest pain and developed septic shock. The patient had a CT torso indicating right upper lobe consolidation and left upper lobe ground glass opacity. An echocardiogram was negative for vegetations. The patient was hemodynamically stable on neosynephrine overnight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/71 mmHg to 68/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and elevated platelet count. Kidney function tests indicate elevated creatinine levels, and liver function tests show elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab results include normal potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, as well as elevated lactic acid levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status, cardiac dysrhythmia, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are delirium, arrhythmias, gastrointestinal bleeding, septic shock, respiratory distress, and acute kidney injury."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD who presented with chest pain and developed septic shock. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, cardiac dysrhythmia, gastrointestinal bleed, severe sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and tuberculosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis and pneumonia, indicating a systemic infection. There is also suspicion of tuberculosis due to the presence of cavitary lung lesions on CT chest. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory symptoms is essential.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has experienced episodes of tachycardia and required cardioversion multiple times. This suggests possible cardiac dysrhythmia. Monitoring the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and any symptoms of chest pain or palpitations is important.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be related to the previous use of CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). Monitoring urine output, electrolyte levels, and creatinine levels is crucial in managing renal function.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient had respiratory failure requiring intubation but has since been extubated. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels, ability to protect the airway, and respiratory effort is essential.

5. Gastrointestinal bleed: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD who presented with chest pain and developed septic shock. The patient had CT torso indicating right upper lobe consolidation and left upper lobe ground glass opacity. An ECHO was negative for vegetations. The patient has been hemodynamically stable on neosynephrine overnight. 

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated with empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics (Pip-Tazo/Azithro/Vanco) due to suspected pneumonia caused by Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci. The patient remains afebrile, but further monitoring is required.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has an unclear history of chronic kidney disease and has now developed an exacerbation in the setting of shock. CVVH was discontinued, and the patient's renal function should be closely monitored with ongoing assessment of input/output balance and follow-up with an outpatient nephrologist.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously intubated but has been successfully extubated and is doing well on a nasal cannula with 5 liters of oxygen. The patient is able to protect his airway and maintain oxygenation. Nebulizer treatments will continue as scheduled.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is awake, alert, and conversant but has persistent confusion. 

5. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient has experienced recurrent supraventricular"

   at cath (had regional STE on ECG), extubated yesterday and doing well,
   though several episodes of SVT requiring cardioversion yesterday, now
   started on amio by cards recommendations.
   For his hypotension and sepsis, he will continue to receive IV
   antibiotics for PNA. Start rapid taper of steroids. Pressor requirement
   is resolving.
   The abdominal pain is puzzling. Will monitor for now and check urine
   culture and c.diff, esp in light of leukocytosis.
   Need to remove the groin line if HD is no longer needed.
   For delirium, will continued antipsychotics.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of COPD and CKD (baseline creatinine level of 2.0) who was admitted with septic shock and respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The patient also had suspected left anterior descending (LAD) coronary vasospasm at the other hospital (OSH) during catheterization, which showed regional ST elevation on ECG.

The patient has been extubated and is currently doing well, although there have been several episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that required cardioversion yesterday. The patient has been started on amiodarone by cardiology recommendations.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), current temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate ranging from 67 to 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/40 to 145/94 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 8 to 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient has received various medications and treatments, including IV fluids, antibiotics for pneumonia, phenylephrine as a pressor, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, fentanyl, and others. The patient's pain level is reported as mild and located in the abdomen.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematoc"

   73M with COPD, CKD (baseline cr 2.0), admitted w/ septic shock and resp
   failure due to pneumonia, with LAD coronary vasospasm suspected at OSH
   at cath (had regional STE on ECG), extubated yesterday and doing well,
   though several episodes of SVT requiring cardioversion yesterday, now
   started on amio by cards recommendations.
   For his hypotension and sepsis, he will continue to receive IV
   antibiotics for PNA. Start rapid taper of steroids. Pressor requirement
   is resolving.
   The abdominal pain is puzzling. Will monitor for now and check urine
   culture and c.diff, esp in light of leukocytosis.
   Need to remove the groin line if HD is no longer needed.
   For delirium, will continued antipsychotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD and CKD, who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock and respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The patient also had suspected left anterior descending coronary vasospasm during cardiac catheterization. He was extubated yesterday and is currently experiencing several episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), for which he is being treated with amiodarone. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 145/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's mental status is improving after extubation, but he has episodes of agitation and confusion. He has mild abdominal pain and is experiencing leukocytosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is still receiving IV antibiotics, indicating an ongoing risk of infection.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has experienced episodes of SVT, which may require further monitoring and management.
3. Delirium: The patient shows signs of agitation and confusion, which could be related to delirium, especially in the context of being critically ill and recently extubated.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain needs further evaluation to determine the cause, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD who presented with chest pain and developed septic shock. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and delirium. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines and tubes. He is receiving treatment with antibiotics (zosyn and azithromycin), vasopressors, diuretics, and sedatives. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and there are concerns about hypoxia and fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock likely related to pneumonia. It is important to continue aggressive treatment with antibiotics to prevent further complications.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing intermittent hypoxia with agitation, which may be due to acute respiratory failure. Supplemental oxygen and diuretics may be necessary to manage this condition.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level has risen from 2.0 to 3.9, indicating acute renal failure. Diuretics and further plans for hemodialysis should be considered to manage fluid overload and prevent worsening of renal function.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing severe agitation and visual hallucinations, likely due to delirium. Managing pain, treating infections, discontinuing hydrocortisone, and providing sedation as needed with valium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with chest pain and developed septic shock. He was found to have right upper lobe (RUL) consolidation and left upper lobe (LUL) ground glass opacity on computed tomography (CT) scan. An echocardiogram did not show vegetations. The patient was hemodynamically stable on neosynephrine overnight but remained afebrile with leukocytosis. The patient has been treated empirically with piperacillin-tazobactam, azithromycin, and vancomycin for pneumonia, as well as airborne precautions until three negative sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears. A steroid taper has been started, and the patient's central venous pressure (CVP) line has been discontinued. The patient's condition remains stable, but he requires close monitoring for potential medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, as he is still on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and may require reintubation if there is a deterioration in his oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Sepsis/Severe Sepsis/Sepsis Shock: Despite initial improvement, the patient's condition remains critical, and there is a risk of recurrent sepsis or progression to septic"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with chest pain and developed septic shock. The patient had an elevated temperature, increased heart rate, and low blood pressure. The initial CT torso showed right upper lobe consolidation and left upper lobe ground glass opacity. An echocardiogram was negative for vegetations. The patient remained hemodynamically stable on neosynephrine overnight.

The patient's leukocytosis continued to increase, and repeat sputum cultures were done to check for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear. Airborne precautions were continued until three negative sputum AFB smears were obtained. Empiric antibiotics were started for pneumonia, including piperacillin-tazobactam, azithromycin, and vancomycin. A steroid taper was also initiated.

The patient's platelet count and creatinine levels were monitored. The patient's cardiac index decreased, and fluid administration was decreased accordingly. The patient remained afebrile, and his respiratory status improved, allowing for extubation yesterday.

Renal failure was noted, with an unclear history of chronic kidney disease. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) was discontinued, and the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels were monitored. The patient's respiratory failure improved, and he was successfully extubated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD who presented with chest pain and developed septic shock. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis with organ dysfunction.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Delirium: The patient has experienced acute delirium and visual hallucinations. This could be a result of sepsis or other underlying conditions.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has intermittent hypoxia with agitation, which can be severe at times. This may be due to respiratory failure or pneumonia.

3. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 2.0, but it has now risen to 3.9. Oliguria (low urine output) is also present. This indicates acute renal failure, and further plans for dialysis should be considered.

4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has orthopnea, low normal ejection fraction (EF), and bibasilar rales on lung examination. These findings suggest CHF as a possible complication.

5. Infection: The patient has been treated for various infections, including pneumonia, and is currently on antibiotics. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection is crucial.

6. Fluid overload: The patient has non-pitting edema and an increased fluid balance. This may be related"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with COPD and CKD who presented with possible coronary vasospasm, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He was previously on HD, PNA, shock, and is now much improved off pressors, extubated, with intermittent delirium and psychosis, possible steroid psychosis. The patient's oxygen requirement has slightly increased this morning and overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to the previous respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if the patient's delirium and agitation persist, leading to inadequate oxygenation.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's CKD puts him at risk for further renal deterioration. Monitoring kidney function and maintaining fluid balance will be crucial to prevent worsening renal failure.
3. Infection: Despite the negative microbiology results, there is still a possibility of an undiagnosed infection, especially since the patient is still on antibiotics. Close monitoring for signs of infection and completing appropriate antibiotic therapy is important.
4. Delirium and Psychosis: The patient's intermittent delirium and psychosis require careful management. If not properly addressed, it can lead to increased agitation, disorientation, and potential complications such as falls or self-harm.
5. Steroid Psychosis: The patient's possible steroid psychosis should be considered, and the use of steroids should be carefully evaluated and monitored.

   Assessment and Plan
   73M with COPD, CKD, presented with possible coronary vasospasm,
   resporatory failure and renal failure previoiusly on HD, PNA, shock,
   now much improved off pressors, extubated, with intermittent delirium
   and psychosis, possible steroid psychosis. This morning and overnight
   the O2 requirement is slightly higher.
   Will continue antibiotics for pneumonia and stop TB precautions.
   Leukocytosis improving now off steroids. UCx is pending but no new
   infection has been identified.
   To help with oxygenation and effusions, will try furosemide boluses.
   Because he may required HD again, will keep the HD catheter in place.
   Delirium and agitation with psychosis likely multifactorial with
   possibility of etoh withdrawal, tobacco cravings, disorientation. Will
   continue with prn benzos and standing as well as prn haloperidol and
   reassess.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD, CKD, presenting with possible coronary vasospasm, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He was previously on HD, PNA, shock, and is now much improved off pressors, extubated, with intermittent delirium and psychosis, possibly due to steroid psychosis. The patient's O2 requirement is slightly higher this morning and overnight. He will continue with antibiotics for pneumonia and stop TB precautions. Leukocytosis is improving now off steroids. UCx is pending but no new infection has been identified. Furosemide boluses will be tried to help with oxygenation and effusions. The HD catheter will be kept in place as the patient may require HD again. Delirium and agitation with psychosis are likely multifactorial, possibly including etoh withdrawal, tobacco cravings, disorientation. Prn benzos and standing, as well as prn haloperidol, will be reassessed. The patient is critically ill."
