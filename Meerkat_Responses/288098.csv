   IMAGING:
   [**2148-11-29**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is borderline dilated. There is severe regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral
   akinesis. There is moderate to severe hypokinesis of the remaining
   segments (LVEF <20%). The estimated cardiac index is depressed
   (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
   The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global
   free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal
   motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload, as
   well as a conduction abnormality or RV apical pacing. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is at
   least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, athough this may be
   underestimated given severity of TR. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and global
   systolic dysfunction, c/w prior extensive inferior myocardial
   infarction and a superimposed process (or multivessel CAD). Markedly
   dilated right ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction. Mild
   aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
   Depressed cardiac index and at least mild pulmonary hypertension.
   CXR: ETT balloon hyperinflated. Low lung volumes, with possible mild
   vascular congestion. Moderate cardiomegaly.
   CT head: No acute intracranial abnormality. No intracranial hemorrhage
   or loss of [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation.
   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M with PMH significant for CHF (EF: 20-25%), CAD s/p CABG, CKD,
   a-fib on coumadin, s/p ICD, presents after VF arrest.
   .
   #. VF Arrest: ?PEA arrest. Defibrillator interrogated and showed no VF.
   Several episodes of VT over the last several weeks.
   - re-warm today
   - sedation with fentanyl and versed, wean today
   - continue EEG monitoring
   - continue home mexiletine
   - monitor neuro status, call neuro to examine when pt is awake
   - holding coumadin for a-fib
   - cont home amio
   - head CT negative for acute intracranial abnormality
   - f/u EP recs
   -
   # CORONARIES: Pt with CABG and recent cath 3 months prior that showed
   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.
   - ASA 325mg and lipitor 20mg (hold high dose given LFT abnormality)
   - monitor tele
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   .
   # PUMP: Pt with severe CHF. Patient appears to be overloaded on exam.
   Although JVP difficult to assess. Pt with lower ext edema evidence of
   pulm edema on CXR.
   - dobutamine 5mcg/min to improve CI
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   - Lasix bolus with gtt
   .
   #. Resp Distress: Pt was intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of VF arrest. Patient likely volume overloaded from CHF and pulm edema
   on CXR.
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated
   - Lasix bolus, followed by gtt
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely cardiogenic shock in the setting of VF arrest and
   cardiomyopathy with low EF. Pt with leukocytosis, but likely reactive.
   Pt afebrile and no clear source of infection. CXR no infiltrate. Pt was
   started on neo and levo in the ED.
   - dobutamine, as above
   - maintain MAPS >60
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   .
   # Gap Acidosis: Pt gap was 20 on admission. Lactate 2.4. Likely
   combination of lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion and uremia given Cr
   5.3.
   - sodium bicarb in D5
   - management of underlying cause as above
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with Cr 5.3. No baseline for
   comparison, but per family patient has severe kidney disease. Pt
   potassium wnl. Poor UOP per family
   - renal recs appr, no HD at this time
   - sodium bicarb, as above
   - check PTH
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely reactive in the setting of VF arrest. No clear
   source of infection.
   - management as above
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Likely due to poor forward flow. Bili is wnl making
   obstruction unlikely.
   - cont to trend
   .
   #. Gout: holding meds for now
   .
   FEN: NPO, novasource TF

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Pt remains sedated and intubated. No spontaneous movements yet but he
   remains on Fentanyl and Versed. EEG and post-arrest study drug
   continue. He is now warming as cooling has completed. Volume status is
   + 4.7L per 24 hours and CXR shows CHF. Fio2 has increased to 50% as
   well. WBC improving, creat fluctuating around 4.8. CK peak is 520 with
   MB 13. LFTs are slightly lower than yesterday. Echo shows global hypo
   with EF 20% (down from 35% from outside cardiologist). ICD
   interrogation demonstrates multiple episodes of VT treated by ATP and
   no shocks but no events to corrospond to 7pm Friday when the patient
   arrested per his family. Today we will lighten or discontinue the
   sedation and assess underlying neuro function. Continue amio and
   mexilitine per neuro for VT. Increase Dobuta to 5 mcg/kg/min to augment
   CI (1.1 by echo) as well as lasix drip.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7045**] and [**Doctor Last Name 2351**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation on coumadin.
- The patient presented after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, likely due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The defibrillator did not show VF, and several episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were documented over the last several weeks.
- The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
- The patient is sedated and intubated for airway protection. He remains on dobutamine, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl (concentrate), and norepinephrine infusions.
- The patient has a history of severe CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. His recent echocardiogram showed severe regional and global systolic dysfunction, dilated left and right ventricles, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and depressed cardiac index.

   IMAGING:
   [**2148-11-29**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is borderline dilated. There is severe regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral
   akinesis. There is moderate to severe hypokinesis of the remaining
   segments (LVEF <20%). The estimated cardiac index is depressed
   (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
   The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global
   free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal
   motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload, as
   well as a conduction abnormality or RV apical pacing. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is at
   least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, athough this may be
   underestimated given severity of TR. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and global
   systolic dysfunction, c/w prior extensive inferior myocardial
   infarction and a superimposed process (or multivessel CAD). Markedly
   dilated right ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction. Mild
   aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
   Depressed cardiac index and at least mild pulmonary hypertension.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. The patient presented after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. He has had episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the past and has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) that did not fire. The patient was started on lidocaine and cooling protocol.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and sedated. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 30/20 mmHg with a cardiac index of 2.0 L/min/m2, and a mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 67%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), troponin-T, and lactate, indicating myocardial injury and ischemia. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. Imaging studies"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Pt remains sedated and intubated. No spontaneous movements yet but he
   remains on Fentanyl and Versed. EEG and post-arrest study drug
   continue. He is now warming as cooling has completed. Volume status is
   + 4.7L per 24 hours and CXR shows CHF. Fio2 has increased to 50% as
   well. WBC improving, creat fluctuating around 4.8. CK peak is 520 with
   MB 13. LFTs are slightly lower than yesterday. Echo shows global hypo
   with EF 20% (down from 35% from outside cardiologist). ICD
   interrogation demonstrates multiple episodes of VT treated by ATP and
   no shocks but no events to corrospond to 7pm Friday when the patient
   arrested per his family. Today we will lighten or discontinue the
   sedation and assess underlying neuro function. Continue amio and
   mexilitine per neuro for VT. Increase Dobuta to 5 mcg/kg/min to augment
   CI (1.1 by echo) as well as lasix drip.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7045**] and [**Doctor Last Name 2351**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and was resuscitated successfully. The patient has severe systolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient also has markedly dilated right ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction. 

The patient's current medications include dobutamine, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, norepinephrine, famotidine (Pepcid), and lasix. The patient is sedated and intubated, and the plan is to lighten or discontinue the sedation to assess underlying neuro function. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine (Cr), and lactate levels. The patient's potassium levels are within normal limits. 

The patient's imaging studies reveal moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and mild aortic regurgitation. The patient's chest X-ray shows evidence of CHF and pulmonary edema. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 101/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a moderately dilated left atrium, moderately dilated right atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, borderline dilated left ventricular cavity size, severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis, moderate to severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments, depressed cardiac index, no masses or thrombi in the left ventricle, markedly dilated right ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction, abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload, conduction abnormality or RV apical pacing, structurally normal aortic valve leaflets with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis, mild (1+) aortic regurgitation, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets, moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation, moderate (2+) tricuspid regurgitation, at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, no pericardial effusion, and no acute intracranial abnormality on computed tomography (CT) head. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for VF arrest. The patient's allergies include gout. The patient's social history is significant for smoking. 

The patient's family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. 

The patient's medical history includes CHF, CAD, CKD, atrial fibrillation, and an ICD. 

The patient's current medications include aspirin, lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and clopidogrel. 

The patient's home medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, lisinopril, aspirin, simvastatin, and allopurinol. 

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on [**Date**]. 

The patient's physical activity level is moderate. 

The patient's functional status is poor. 

The patient's occupation is retired. 

The patient's marital status is married."

   a-fib on coumadin, s/p ICD, presents after VF arrest.
   .
   #. VF Arrest: ?PEA arrest. Defibrillator interrogated and showed no VF.
   Several episodes of VT over the last several weeks. Pt had persistent
   runs of VT overnight
 given Amio bolus and gtt increased from 0.5
   1mg/min. Dobutamine d/c
 no further VT afterwards.
   - sedation with fentanyl and versed, wean today
   - continue EEG monitoring
   - continue home mexiletine
   - f/u neuro recs
   - holding coumadin for a-fib
   - amio gtt at 1mg/min
   - head CT negative for acute intracranial abnormality
   - f/u EP recs
   # CORONARIES: Pt with CABG and recent cath 3 months prior that showed
   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.
   - ASA 325mg and lipitor 20mg (hold high dose given LFT abnormality)
   - monitor tele
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   .
   # PUMP: Pt with severe CHF, EF<20%. Patient appears to be overloaded on
   exam. Pt with lower ext edema evidence of pulm edema on CXR. UOP
   improved yesterday on Dobutamine and Lasix gtt. Dobutamine was d/c
   overnight [**1-22**] to VT.
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   - continue Lasix gtt
   .
   #. Resp Distress: Pt was intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of VF arrest. Patient likely volume overloaded from CHF and pulm edema
   on CXR.
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated
   - cont Lasix gtt
   - repeat CXR this AM
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely cardiogenic shock in the setting of VF arrest and
   cardiomyopathy with low EF. Pt with leukocytosis and febrile overnight.
   No clear source of infection, but patient pan-cultured. Previous CXR
   with no infiltrate. Pt on Levophed for pressure support.
   - cont Levophed
   - maintain MAPS >60
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - f/u cultures
   - start broad spectrum Abx
   .
   # Gap Acidosis: Pt gap was 20 on admission. Lactate 2.4. Likely
   combination of lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion and uremia given Cr
   5.3. Pt given sodium bicarb in D5 yesterday, as per renal. pH improved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented after experiencing ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient has had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the past few weeks and continues to experience VT overnight. He was sedated and intubated for airway protection.

Medical Complications:
1. VF arrest: The patient experienced a VF arrest, which required defibrillation. The exact cause of the VF arrest is unclear, but it may be related to his underlying cardiomyopathy with a low ejection fraction (EF).
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is likely in cardiogenic shock due to his severe CHF and low EF. This is indicated by his hypotension and need for pressure support with norepinephrine.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient appears to be volume overloaded and has evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. He is being treated with diuretics to manage this condition.
4. CKD: The patient has chronic kidney disease, as evidenced by his elevated creatinine levels and poor urine output. His potassium levels are within normal limits, but he has a high phosphorus level"

   a-fib on coumadin, s/p ICD, presents after VF arrest.
   .
   #. VF Arrest: ?PEA arrest. Defibrillator interrogated and showed no VF.
   Several episodes of VT over the last several weeks. Pt had persistent
   runs of VT overnight
 given Amio bolus and gtt increased from 0.5
   1mg/min. Dobutamine d/c
 no further VT afterwards.
   - sedation with fentanyl and versed, wean today
   - continue EEG monitoring
   - continue home mexiletine
   - f/u neuro recs
   - holding coumadin for a-fib
   - amio gtt at 1mg/min
   - head CT negative for acute intracranial abnormality
   - f/u EP recs
   # CORONARIES: Pt with CABG and recent cath 3 months prior that showed
   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.
   - ASA 325mg and lipitor 20mg (hold high dose given LFT abnormality)
   - monitor tele
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   .
   # PUMP: Pt with severe CHF, EF<20%. Patient appears to be overloaded on
   exam. Pt with lower ext edema evidence of pulm edema on CXR. UOP
   improved yesterday on Dobutamine and Lasix gtt. Dobutamine was d/c
   overnight [**1-22**] to VT.
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   - continue Lasix gtt
   .
   #. Resp Distress: Pt was intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of VF arrest. Patient likely volume overloaded from CHF and pulm edema
   on CXR.
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated
   - cont Lasix gtt
   - repeat CXR this AM
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely cardiogenic shock in the setting of VF arrest and
   cardiomyopathy with low EF. Pt with leukocytosis and febrile overnight.
   No clear source of infection, but patient pan-cultured. Previous CXR
   with no infiltrate. Pt on Levophed for pressure support.
   - cont Levophed
   - maintain MAPS >60
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - f/u cultures
   - start broad spectrum Abx
 Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Gap Acidosis: Pt gap was 20 on admission. Lactate 2.4. Likely
   combination of lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion and uremia given Cr
   5.3. Pt given sodium bicarb in D5 yesterday, as per renal. pH improved.
   - management of underlying cause as above
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with Cr 5.3. No baseline for
   comparison, but per family patient has severe kidney disease. Pt
   potassium wnl. Poor UOP per family. Cr trending down to 4.5. PTH 303.

   #. Leukocytosis: Thought to be reactive in the setting of VF arrest,
   but pt was febrile overnight. No clear source of infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- He presented after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and had persistent runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT) overnight.
- The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is sedated with fentanyl and versed.
- He is receiving amiodarone through a continuous infusion at 1 mg/min and has been weaned off dobutamine.
- The patient's temperature is 102.1°F, blood pressure is 109/59 mmHg, heart rate is 84 bpm, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98%.
- His general appearance is intubated and sedated, with sclera anicteric and pink conjunctiva. The neck is supple, and the cardiac examination reveals a point of maximum impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
- Lung sounds are transmitted well, and there are no chest wall deformities or abdominal bruits.
- The patient has 2+ edema in the lower extremities, and pulses are 2+ bilaterally in the carotid and femoral arteries.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 181 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin-T levels.
- Imaging reveals development of pulmonary edema and left basilar atelectasis or consolidation.
- The patient is being managed with multiple medications including aspirin, atorvastatin, lasix, amiodarone, dobutamine, fentanyl, versed, and levophed.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started due to the presence of fever and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of severe CHF and low ejection fraction puts him at risk for cardiogenic shock, which is likely given his hypotension and need for vasopressor support.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis raise concerns for an infection. The presence of pulmonary edema and atelectasis on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. The combination of lactic acidosis and uremia suggests the possibility of acute kidney injury.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk for developing VAP.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of VT and a-fib, and he experienced multiple episodes of VT overnight."

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and a history of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented after experiencing ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. 

During the ICU stay, the patient experienced several episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and was treated with amiodarone bolus and continuous infusion. Dobutamine was discontinued due to VT but resumed later. Sedation was administered to help with agitation. The patient's fever was managed with Tylenol, and a pan-culture was obtained. 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and tidal volume (VT) set at 550 mL. The respiratory support has been adjusted as needed based on the patient's condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 109/59 mmHg, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's central"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2351**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 9992**] is now following commands and tracks voices with his eyes.
   Multiple episodes of slow VT initially responded to IV Amio X two
   boluses and drip but then VT broke through and responded to stopping
   Dobutamine. He had remained without VT this am. ICD reprogrammed to
   sense and ATP slow VT at 120 and above. Temp spikes to 102 and thick
   purulent sputum is treated with Vanco and Zosyn.  WBC continue to
   decline to 8.3. Will continue amio drip as well as antibiotics and
   follow neurological improvement. Creat stable around 4.5. Patient's
   familty has been at the bedside for much of the hopsitalization and is
   aware of his condition.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7045**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], [**Doctor Last Name 575**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (a-fib) on coumadin, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and has had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) since admission. The patient is currently sedated and intubated for airway protection. He is febrile and has leukocytosis, but no clear source of infection has been identified. The patient has a history of poor kidney function and is being managed conservatively. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low ejection fraction (EF<20%) and recent VF arrest suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock. The patient's hypotension and requirement for norepinephrine support indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, as evidenced by his respiratory distress, pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and improvement in urine output with dobutamine and lasix.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of CKD raise concerns about worsening renal function. The patient's urine output is also mentioned as poor"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - cont to have runs of slow VT at 150, pacing out from 11:30-12
   - talked to renal again about HD as urine output has dropped to
   50-60mL/hr on lasix gtt at 10mg/hr.  [**Month (only) 51**] initiate CVVD tomorrow but
   worried about septic physiology and putting in HD line.  Increased
   lasix gtt
   - stopped Mexiletine and started lidocaine gtt
   - started bicarb gtt again but stopped due to concern for volume
   overload
   - gave 100mg lasix bolus and increased gtt to 16mg/hr than 20mg/hr
   - had another episode of frequent VT at 1-2 am. Resolved spontaneously
   but kept amio gtt at 1

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 7045**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9992**] has been off sedation since [**49**] am yesterday and is still
   quite poorly arousable. He does follow commands at times. Creat is
   stable but urinary output is sluggish and so we will add metolozone to
   lasix drip and likely start CVVHD later this afternoon after access is
   placed. He continues to have a retrocardiac opacity on CXR. He
   continues to have breakthrough VT storm despite Amio drip at 1 mg / min
   and Lido drip at 2mg/min. He is off Mexilitine per EP recs. We will
   decrease Lido now to 1 mg/min to avoid toxicity. He remains on Cefipime
   and Vanco for VAP.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7045**] and [**Name (NI) **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and a history of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented after ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and was resuscitated with an advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- The patient is intubated and sedated, with no response to verbal or tactile stimulus.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen.
- The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg, which indicates fluid overload.
- The patient's urine output has decreased to 50-60 mL/hr despite being on furosemide (Lasix) at 10 mg/hr.
- Laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 5.3 mg/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 230 K/uL, and potassium level of"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - cont to have runs of slow VT at 150, pacing out from 11:30-12
   - talked to renal again about HD as urine output has dropped to
   50-60mL/hr on lasix gtt at 10mg/hr.  [**Month (only) 51**] initiate CVVD tomorrow but
   worried about septic physiology and putting in HD line.  Increased
   lasix gtt
   - stopped Mexiletine and started lidocaine gtt
   - started bicarb gtt again but stopped due to concern for volume
   overload
   - gave 100mg lasix bolus and increased gtt to 16mg/hr than 20mg/hr

   - wean down lidocaine prn
   - decrease lidocaine gtt to 0.5mg/hr
   - f/u neuro recs
   - head CT negative for acute intracranial abnormality
   - f/u EP recs, may need intervention once condition stabilize

   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with Cr 5.3. No baseline for
   comparison, but per family patient has severe kidney disease. Pt
   potassium wnl. Poor UOP despite aggressive lasix gtt. Cr trending down
   to 4.5. PTH 303.
   - f/u renal recs
   - plan to initiate CVVH
   - NPO for IR placement of temporary HD line placement today
   - start heparin gtt following line placement for history of afib

   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.

The patient presented after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, which was successfully treated with an ""artic sun"" protocol. However, the patient continues to experience episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) despite increasing antiarrhythmics to lidocaine and amiodarone infusions.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 5.3. There is no baseline for comparison, but the patient has severe kidney disease. The patient's potassium levels are within normal limits, but poor urine output (UOP) persists despite aggressive lasix infusion. The creatinine level is trending down to 4.5, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is elevated at 303.

The patient's coronary arteries are occluded, as shown in a recent catheterization three months prior. No intervention was performed per the patient's wife.

   worsened
   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M with PMH significant for CHF (EF: 20-25%), CAD s/p CABG, CKD,
   a-fib on coumadin, s/p ICD, presents after VF arrest.
   .
   #. VF Arrest: s/p artic sun protocol with no sx of seizure by EEG.
   Still with persistent episodes of VT requiring APT despite increasing
   antiarrhythmics to lidocaine and Amiodarone gtt.
   - continue EEG monitoring
   - wean down lidocaine prn
   - decrease lidocaine gtt to 0.5mg/hr
   - f/u neuro recs
   - head CT negative for acute intracranial abnormality
   - f/u EP recs, may need intervention once condition stabilize
   # CORONARIES: Pt with CABG and recent cath 3 months prior that showed
   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.
   - ASA 325mg and lipitor 20mg (hold high dose given LFT abnormality)
   - monitor tele
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   .
   # PUMP: Pt with severe CHF, EF<20%. Patient appears to be overloaded on
   exam. Pt with lower ext edema evidence of pulm edema on CXR. UOP
   improved yesterday on Dobutamine and Lasix gtt. Dobutamine was d/c
   overnight [**1-22**] to VT.
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   - continue Lasix gtt
   .
   #. Resp Distress: Pt was intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of VF arrest. Patient likely volume overloaded from CHF and pulm edema
   on CXR.
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated
   - cont Lasix gtt
   - repeat CXR this AM
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely cardiogenic shock in the setting of VF arrest and
   cardiomyopathy with low EF. Pt with leukocytosis and febrile overnight.
   No clear source of infection, but patient pan-cultured. Previous CXR
   with no infiltrate. Pt on Levophed for pressure support.
   - cont Levophed
   - maintain MAPS >60
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - f/u cultures
   - start broad spectrum Abx
 Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Gap Acidosis: Pt gap was 20 on admission. Lactate 2.4. Likely
   combination of lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion and uremia given Cr
   5.3. Pt given sodium bicarb in D5 yesterday, as per renal. pH improved.
   - management of underlying cause as above
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with Cr 5.3. No baseline for
   comparison, but per family patient has severe kidney disease. Pt
   potassium wnl. Poor UOP per family. Cr trending down to 4.5. PTH 303.
   - renal recs appr, no HD at this time
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Thought to be reactive in the setting of VF arrest,
   but pt was febrile overnight. No clear source of infection.
   - management as above
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Likely due to poor forward flow.
   - cont to trend

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented after experiencing VF arrest and was resuscitated using an advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol without any seizures as per EEG monitoring.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that are not responding to increasing antiarrhythmics, including lidocaine and amiodarone infusions. The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix) gtt at 20 mg/hr, amiodarone at 1 mg/min, norepinephrine at 0.25 mcg/kg/min, and lidocaine at 2 mg/min.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 110/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and sedated with no purposeful movement.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, lactate levels, and liver enzymes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing runs of slow ventricular tachycardia and has had multiple episodes of fever. The patient's urine output has decreased, leading to concerns about acute kidney injury. The patient's cardiac status is also compromised, with evidence of both systolic and diastolic heart failure. Additionally, there are concerns about impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and a previous cardiac arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of runs of slow VT and recent episode of frequent VT suggests an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. This could potentially lead to hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The decreased urine output and the need for hemodialysis indicate compromised renal function. AKI can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of systolic and diastolic heart failure increases the risk of exacerbation, which can result in fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.
4. Infection/sepsis: The presence of fever and potential skin integrity issues raise concerns about infection. If an infection progresses to sepsis, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Impaired skin integrity:"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M with PMH significant for CHF (EF: 20-25%), CAD s/p CABG, CKD,
   a-fib on coumadin, s/p ICD, presents after VF arrest.
   .
   #. VF Arrest: ?PEA arrest. Defibrillator interrogated and showed no VF.
   Several episodes of VT over the last several weeks. Pt had persistent
   runs of VT overnight
 given Amio bolus and gtt increased from 0.5
   1mg/min. Dobutamine d/c
 no further VT afterwards.
   - sedation with fentanyl and versed, wean today
   - continue EEG monitoring
   - continue home mexiletine
   - f/u neuro recs
   - holding coumadin for a-fib
   - amio gtt at 1mg/min
   - head CT negative for acute intracranial abnormality
   - f/u EP recs
   # CORONARIES: Pt with CABG and recent cath 3 months prior that showed
   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.
   - ASA 325mg and lipitor 20mg (hold high dose given LFT abnormality)
   - monitor tele
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   .
   # PUMP: Pt with severe CHF, EF<20%. Patient appears to be overloaded on
   exam. Pt with lower ext edema evidence of pulm edema on CXR. UOP
   improved yesterday on Dobutamine and Lasix gtt. Dobutamine was d/c
   overnight [**1-22**] to VT.
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   - continue Lasix gtt
   .
   #. Resp Distress: Pt was intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of VF arrest. Patient likely volume overloaded from CHF and pulm edema
   on CXR.
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated
   - cont Lasix gtt
   - repeat CXR this AM
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely cardiogenic shock in the setting of VF arrest and
   cardiomyopathy with low EF. Pt with leukocytosis and febrile overnight.
   No clear source of infection, but patient pan-cultured. Previous CXR
   with no infiltrate. Pt on Levophed for pressure support.
   - cont Levophed
   - maintain MAPS >60
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - f/u cultures
   - start broad spectrum Abx
 Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Gap Acidosis: Pt gap was 20 on admission. Lactate 2.4. Likely
   combination of lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion and uremia given Cr
   5.3. Pt given sodium bicarb in D5 yesterday, as per renal. pH improved.
   - management of underlying cause as above
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with Cr 5.3. No baseline for
   comparison, but per family patient has severe kidney disease. Pt
   potassium wnl. Poor UOP per family. Cr trending down to 4.5. PTH 303.
   - renal recs appr, no HD at this time

   #. Leukocytosis: Thought to be reactive in the setting of VF arrest,
   but pt was febrile overnight. No clear source of infection.
   - management as above

The patient presented after experiencing VF arrest and had several episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the past few weeks.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is intubated for airway protection. He is sedated with fentanyl and versed, and EEG monitoring is continued. The patient is receiving amiodarone (Amio) at a rate of 1 mg/min for VT. Other medications include dobutamine, lasix, ASA, lipitor, and levophed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F), blood pressure ranging from 110/68 to 124/70 mmHg, heart rate between 76 and 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 12-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 4"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M with PMH significant for CHF (EF: 20-25%), CAD s/p CABG, CKD,
   a-fib on coumadin, s/p ICD, presents after VF arrest.
   .
   #. VF Arrest: s/p artic sun protocol with no sx of seizure by EEG.
   Still with persistent episodes of VT requiring APT despite increasing
   antiarrhythmics to lidocaine and Amiodarone gtt.
   - continue EEG monitoring
   - wean down lidocaine prn
   - decrease lidocaine gtt to 0.5mg/hr
   - f/u neuro recs
   - head CT negative for acute intracranial abnormality
   - f/u EP recs, may need intervention once condition stabilize
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with Cr 5.3. No baseline for
   comparison, but per family patient has severe kidney disease. Pt
   potassium wnl. Poor UOP despite aggressive lasix gtt. Cr trending down
   to 4.5. PTH 303.
   - f/u renal recs
   - plan to initiate CVVH
   - NPO for IR placement of temporary HD line placement today
   - start heparin gtt following line placement for history of afib
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with CABG and recent cath 3 months prior that showed
   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.
   - ASA 325mg and lipitor 20mg (hold high dose given LFT abnormality)
   - monitor tele
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   .
   # PUMP: Pt with severe CHF, EF<20%. Patient appears to be overloaded on
   exam. Pt with lower ext edema evidence of pulm edema on CXR. UOP
   improved yesterday on Dobutamine and Lasix gtt. Dobutamine was d/c
   [**1-22**] to VT.
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   - continue Lasix gtt , start metalozone
   -  plan for CVVH for volume overload
   .
   #. Resp Distress: Pt was intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of VF arrest. Evidence of mild
moderate pulmonary edema and PNA on
   CXR.
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated
   - cont Lasix gtt , plan for CVVH for volume removal
   - cont vanc/ cefepime/ clpro for VAP
   - repeat CXR this AM
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely cardiogenic shock in the setting of VF arrest and
   cardiomyopathy with low EF. Pt with leukocytosis and febrile overnight.
   No clear source of infection, but patient pan-cultured. Previous CXR
   with no infiltrate. Pt on Levophed for pressure support.
   - cont Levophed
   - maintain MAPS >60
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - f/u cultures
   - cont broad spectrum Abx
 Vanc/cefepime/ cipro
   .
   # Gap Acidosis: Pt gap was 20 on admission. Lactate 2.4. Likely
   combination of lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion and uremia given Cr
   5.3. Pt given sodium bicarb in D5 yesterday, as per renal. pH improved.
   - management of underlying cause as above
   ..
   #. Transaminitis: Likely due to poor forward flow.
   - cont to trend
   .
   #. Gout: holding meds for now
   .
   FEN: NPO pending IR line placement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing multiple medical complications. 

1. The patient's neurological status is concerning as triphasic waves were noted on the EEG, suggesting metabolic encephalopathy. A head CT was ordered to evaluate for anoxic brain injury.
2. The patient has been experiencing episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were paced out. Despite attempts by the ICD to pace the heart, there was no improvement. The patient's blood pressure was also low at 50 mmHg, leading to cardioversion at 300.
3. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ciprofloxacin, Cefepime, and Vancomycin.
4. The patient is on several infusions, including amiodarone, heparin sodium, calcium gluconate (CRRT), norepinephrine, and lidocaine.
5. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation.
6. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, high potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
7. The patient has been receiving various medications for different conditions, such as metoclopramide, calcium acetate, chlorothiazide, vancom"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU for cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation. The patient has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, and signs of heart failure. He has multiple comorbidities and is currently on several medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and altered mental status may indicate an infection, which could potentially lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, edema, and elevated JVP suggest heart failure. This condition can worsen if not managed appropriately.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, medications, or metabolic imbalances. Proper assessment and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Thromboembolic Events: Given the patient's immobility and risk factors, there is a potential for thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylaxis measures should be implemented to reduce the risk.
5. Medication Reactions/Interactions: With the patient on multiple medications, there is a possibility of drug interactions or adverse reactions. Regular monitoring and adjustment of medications are crucial to avoid complications.
6. Organ Dysfunction: The patient"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient was a bit more responsive yesterday following commands and
   tracking voices. This am he is poorly responsive. He had another
   prolonged episode of VT last night for which he intermittently
   anti-tach paced but much of it was too slow to be detected by his ICD
   and required one shock with 300J with conversion to NSR. This am we
   have decreased his ATP detection zone to 113 beats per min. Lidocaine
   2mg/min without bolus was added to Amio last night after this episode
   and remains on. He is afebrile. CXR and ABG are much improved and we
   would like to extubate if he can protect his airway. Head CT was
   unrevealing. He remains on CVVHD to augment urinary output with
   excellent volume removal. He will continue Vanco, Cipro and Cefipime
   D#4 for VAP.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to airway protection. He has episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and remains on antiarrhythmics.

Assessment and Plan:
1. VF Arrest: The patient had a VF arrest and received an arctic sun protocol without seizure activity detected on EEG. He continues to experience episodes of VT despite being on amiodarone and lidocaine. Increased lidocaine to 2 mg/min and amiodarone to 0.5 mg/min. Continue EEG monitoring, continue antiarrhythmics until weaned off pressors, follow-up neuro recommendations, continue heparin gtt for history of atrial fibrillation, and follow-up electrophysiology (EP) recommendations for possible intervention once condition stabilizes.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 5.3. No baseline available for comparison, but per family, the patient has severe kidney disease"

   - AM Vanco ordered,
   - started on diuril, I/O about even as of 18:00
   - Neuro: Triphasic waves noted on EEG suggests metabolic
   encephalopathy.  Head CT to eval for anoxic brain injury.
   - CT head: No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, large masses, mass effect,
   or large vascular territory infarction. Coiling of NGT in NP.
   - EP: wean lidocaine
   - temp line placed, CVVH started.
   - changed tube feeds per Nutrition recs to Vivonex + reglan
   - successfully weaning levophed.
   - reduced FiO2 to 40, weaning RR
   - lidocaine off
   - had several episodes of Vtach at 4:15, paced out.  One episode, ICD
   tried pacing 4X, without improvement.  SBP 50, cardioverted at 300.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient was a bit more responsive yesterday following commands and
   tracking voices. This am he is poorly responsive. He had another
   prolonged episode of VT last night for which he intermittently
   anti-tach paced but much of it was too slow to be detected by his ICD
   and required one shock with 300J with conversion to NSR. This am we
   have decreased his ATP detection zone to 113 beats per min. Lidocaine
   2mg/min without bolus was added to Amio last night after this episode
   and remains on. He is afebrile. CXR and ABG are much improved and we
   would like to extubate if he can protect his airway. Head CT was
   unrevealing. He remains on CVVHD to augment urinary output with
   excellent volume removal. He will continue Vanco, Cipro and Cefipime
   D#4 for VAP.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation on warfarin, who presented after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He remains in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. VF Arrest: The patient experienced a VF arrest and underwent an ACLS protocol without any seizures as noted on EEG. Despite being on amiodarone and lidocaine, he continues to have episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The threshold for ATP has been decreased to a heart rate of 113, and ongoing EEG monitoring is recommended. Lidocaine will be weaned as tolerated, and amiodarone infusion will be continued at 0.5 mg/min.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is trending down from 5.3 to 2.8 with aggressive diuresis and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). CVVH will be continued, and diuretics will be discontinued while receiving CVVHD.

3. Coronaries: The patient had a CABG three months ago, with occluded grafts. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows left bundle branch block ("

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient was extubated this am during rounds and tolerated it well. Two
   episodes of NSVT overnight were treated with ATP successfully. Per EP,
   lidocaine has been discontinued and the patient remains on Amiodorone
   100 mg QD (off Mexilitine too) and there is discussion among the EP
   service for a potential VT ablation early next week. Neurologically, he
   seems mostly intact responding appropriately to questions. For his real
   failure, he has had aggressive volume depletion with his own renal
   function and with the assistance of the CVVHD. Renal has recommended
   the CVVHD be stopped today and follow his renal function off Lasix and
   diuril. For VAP he remains on Cefipime, Vanco, cipro day #5 of a 10 day
   course. We will wean Levofed today.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 50 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He presented after experiencing a VF arrest and was treated with an artic sun protocol. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is currently on minimal ventilator settings.

Medical Complications:

1. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level was 5.3 upon admission, indicating renal failure. CVVHD was initiated, and the patient's renal function is improving with a decreasing creatinine level. The plan is to discontinue CVVHD for now and trend urine output.

2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD and previous CABG. His recent catheterization showed occluded grafts. Given the patient's comorbidities, including severe CHF, CKD, and poor functional status, medical management is recommended at this time. The patient is on ASA 325 mg and Lipitor 20 mg, with a hold on high-dose Lipitor due to liver function test abnormalities. Monitoring tele is ongoing, and beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are being held due to hypotension.

3. Pump Dysfunction: The patient has severe"

   71 yo M with PMH significant for CHF (EF: 20-25%), CAD s/p CABG, CKD,
   a-fib on coumadin, s/p ICD, presents after VF arrest.
   .
   #. VF Arrest: s/p artic sun protocol with no sx of seizure by EEG.
   Still with persistent episodes of VT storm despite Amiodarone and
   lidocaine gtts.  [**12-1**] had episode of sustained VT at 120 requiring
   manual defibrillation with 300J x 1.  Increased lidocaine gtt back to
   2mg/min and Amiodarone 0.5mg/min
   - decrease threshold for ATP to HR of 113
   - continue EEG monitoring, f/u neuron recs
   - wean lidocaine as tolerated
   - cont heparin gtt for hx of atrial fibnllation
   - f/u EP recs, may need intervention once condition stabilize
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Admitted with Cr 5.3. No baseline
   for comparison, but per family patient has severe kidney disease. Pt
   potassium wnl PTH 303. Poor UOP despite aggressive lasix gtt. Cr
   trending down to 2.8 with aggressive diuresis and CVVH.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont CVVH
   - d/c diuril and Lasix while receiving CVVHD
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with CABG and recent cath 3 months prior that showed
   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented after experiencing ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's current condition includes persistent episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm despite being treated with amiodarone and lidocaine. He also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.8 and poor urine output (UOP). The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and diuresis.

In terms of cardiac management, the patient has occluded grafts from a previous CABG, and recent catheterization showed no intervention was performed. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is less than 20%, indicating severe CHF. Due to these comorbidities and poor functional status, medical management is recommended at this time.

The patient's respiratory status shows evidence of mild to moderate pulmonary edema and pneumonia on chest X-ray. He is on minimal ventilator settings and can likely be extubated if he can protect his airway.

Other assessments include transaminitis, likely due"

   - cont amiodarone 100mg daily
   - cont heparin gtt for hx of atrial fibnllation
   - f/u EP recs, may need intervention once condition stabilize
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Admitted with Cr 5.3. No baseline
   for comparison, but per family, patient has severe kidney disease. Pt
   potassium wnl PTH 303. Cr trending down to 1.7 with CVVHD and good
   urine output: improving renal function vs. Creatinine clearance from
   ultrafiltration
   - d/c CVVHD for now and trend UOP
   - hold off on diuretic use
   - follow pm renal function
   - renally dose all medications

   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.
   - ASA 325mg and lipitor 20mg (hold high dose given LFT abnormality)

   #. Resp Distress: Pt was intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of VF arrest. Evidence of mild
moderate pulmonary edema and PNA on CXR
   which has improved with aggressive volume removal.  On minimal
   ventilator settings and can likely be extubated if can protect airway
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated

- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
- The patient presented after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and underwent advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol without any signs of seizure activity.
- The patient's VF arrest was successfully treated with ATP on the defibrillator, and antiarrhythmics were weaned to amiodarone 100mg daily and lidocaine.
- The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a previous creatinine level of 5.3. Renal function is improving with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and good urine output.
- The patient has a history of CABG, but recent catheterization showed occluded grafts. ECG shows left bundle branch block (LBBB), and cardiac enzymes are elevated with Troponin at 0.16 and CK at 521, MB: 13. Given the patient's comorbidities, medical management is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and was resuscitated. He is currently admitted with acute renal failure, sustained ventricular tachycardia, fever, impaired skin integrity, acute heart failure (systolic and diastolic), and altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 110/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is now extubated and speaking and eating well. He has poor urine output post discontinuation of CVVHD.

The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, lidocaine, famotidine, and other ICU medications. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and low albumin levels. Imaging and microbiology results are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF)
2. Ventricular Tachycardia, Sustained
3. Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia, Not Fever of Unknown Origin)
4. Impaired Skin Integrity
5. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic and Diastolic, Acute
6. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium)
7. Cardiac Arrest

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
2. Continued episodes of ventricular tachycardia may require further antiarrhythmic interventions.
3. Fever could indicate an underlying infection or sepsis, which needs to be investigated.
4. Impaired skin integrity may lead to pressure ulcers or infections.
5. Acute heart failure could worsen, leading to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
6. Altered mental status may progress to delirium or coma if not addressed.
7. Cardiac arrest may recur if arrhythmias are not effectively managed."

   #. VF Arrest: s/p artic sun protocol with no sx of seizure by EEG.
   Antiarrhythmics weaned to amiodarone 100mg daily and lidocaine gtt
   d/ced.  Still with some persistent VT, but successfully ATP with
   reduced threshold on defibrillator (HR = 113).  VT when pt in sinus,
   perhaps can demand pace him to prevent VT/VF.
   - cont amiodarone 100mg daily, dc lido
   - cont heparin gtt for hx of atrial fibnllation
   - start BB 25mg tid to reduce rate of sinus rhthm,
   - f/u EP recs, may need intervention once condition stabilize
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Admitted with Cr 5.3. No baseline
   for comparison, but per family, patient has severe kidney disease. Pt
   potassium wnl PTH 303. Cr trending down to 1.7 with CVVHD and good
   urine output: improving renal function vs. Creatinine clearance from
   ultrafiltration
   - f/u UOP off diuretics
   - follow pm renal function
   - renally dose all medications
   # CORONARIES: Pt with CABG and recent cath 3 months prior that showed
   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.
   - ASA 325mg and lipitor 20mg (hold high dose given LFT abnormality)
   - monitor tele
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   # PUMP: Pt with severe CHF, EF<20%.   Currently -1.1 L LOS with
   aggressive diuresis using CVVHD and diuretics.  Decreasing anasarca on
   exam, CXR with minimal pulmonary edema.  Initially requiring multiple
   pressors, dobutamine was d/c
d [**1-22**] to VT and levophed is being weaned.
   - holding BB and ACEI given hypotension
   - wean down pressors, consider switching to dobutamine if pt
   persistently hypotensive
   - strict I/O
   #. Resp Distress: Pt was intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of VF arrest. Evidence of mild
moderate pulmonary edema and PNA on CXR
   which has improved with aggressive volume removal.  On minimal
   ventilator settings and can likely be extubated if can protect airway

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 568**] and [**Doctor Last Name **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 9992**] is doing well from the respiratory standpoint after
   successful extubation yesterday afternoon. He had more VT last evening
   requiring the re-initiation of Lido at 2 mg/min. His VT has been mostly
   supressed on this although he did have four pace terminated episodes of
   VT overnight. This am he is quite somnolent and confused on Lido. CVVH
   is off and urine output is good. Creat is baseline at 2.2. LFTs remain
   moderately elevated. Sputum has GNR and S aureus.
   Therefore, for his VT, I have spoken to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5152**] and we will add
   back Mexilitine 150 mg TID to Amio 100 QD as Lido is off. Resume
   Metoprolol 25m g TID to slow rate and we will try to keep him paced at
   baseline to avoid VT. Vanco, Cipro, Cefipime for VAP. Creat baseline
   off CVVH. Will watch LFTs.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 568**] and [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has experienced multiple episodes of VT, which is a serious heart rhythm disorder. The patient is currently on antiarrhythmic medications, including amiodarone and lidocaine, to control the VT. It is important to monitor the effectiveness of these medications and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has been deteriorating, with an initial creatinine level of 5.3. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) to support kidney function. Close monitoring of the patient's urine output and renal function is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient initially presented with moderate pulmonary edema, but it has improved with aggressive fluid removal. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is essential to prevent the recurrence of pulmonary edema.

4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient was intubated for airway protection and has developed pneumonia. Antibiotics have been initiated to treat the infection, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. It is important to assess the response to the antibiotic therapy and consider changes if necessary.

5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has moderately elevated liver function tests"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 568**] and [**Doctor Last Name **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 9992**] is doing well from the respiratory standpoint after
   successful extubation yesterday afternoon. He had more VT last evening
   requiring the re-initiation of Lido at 2 mg/min. His VT has been mostly
   supressed on this although he did have four pace terminated episodes of
   VT overnight. This am he is quite somnolent and confused on Lido. CVVH
   is off and urine output is good. Creat is baseline at 2.2. LFTs remain
   moderately elevated. Sputum has GNR and S aureus.
   Therefore, for his VT, I have spoken to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5152**] and we will add
   back Mexilitine 150 mg TID to Amio 100 QD as Lido is off. Resume
   Metoprolol 25m g TID to slow rate and we will try to keep him paced at
   baseline to avoid VT. Vanco, Cipro, Cefipime for VAP. Creat baseline
   off CVVH. Will watch LFTs.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 568**] and [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. He presented after experiencing cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including renal failure, sustained ventricular tachycardia, fever, impaired skin integrity, and acute heart failure.
- The patient has undergone various interventions, such as CVVHD (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), extubation, and management of multiple medications.
- His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 110/62 mmHg and heart rate of 69 bpm. He is still experiencing episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which have been managed with antiarrhythmic medications.
- The patient's renal function is improving, as indicated by decreasing creatinine levels. His urine output is good, and he no longer requires CVVHD.
- His mental status is somnolent and confused, possibly due to the effects of medication.
- The patient's sputum culture shows growth of gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus.
- The plan moving forward includes adding mexilitine to the patient's antiarrhythmic regimen, resuming metoprolol to slow the heart rate, and continuing with appropriate antibiotic coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current clinical presentation, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has experienced multiple episodes of sustained VT, which is a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia. It is essential to continue antiarrhythmic therapy and monitor the patient closely for any further episodes.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute renal failure (ARF). Close monitoring of renal function, including serum creatinine levels, is necessary. Diuretics should be used cautiously due to the patient's impaired renal function.

3. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has severe systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF: 20-25%). Aggressive diuresis and fluid removal are required to manage pulmonary edema and improve cardiac function. Pressors may be needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has altered mental status and impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and proper skin care should be implemented to prevent further complications.

5. Fever and Infection: The patient has a heavy growth of Gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive in the sputum culture. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on culture results to effectively treat the underlying infection.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) who presented with a VT storm. The patient has undergone an Arctic Sun protocol and has nearly full neurological recovery, but remains in persistent VT. The patient's wishes are to refuse amiodarone, despite being aware that it is unlikely to help. The patient's hypotension is a component of his VT, and no pressors are being used. The patient's comfort is being prioritized, and discomfort is being treated with morphine. The patient has a low ejection fraction (<20%) and is receiving 1L of positive inotropic support. Diuretics will not be used due to the patient's poor prognosis. The patient is on a regular diet and does not require peritoneal lavage (PPX). Code status is DNR/DNI, and the patient will be disposed to the floor without telemetry."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male who presented with a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and is currently experiencing a VT storm. Despite receiving cardioversion and being paced out of VT multiple times, the patient remains in persistent VT. The patient has made a nearly full neurological recovery but is aware of his poor prognosis. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient's current condition of persistent VT is a significant medical complication. VT is a life-threatening heart rhythm that can lead to cardiac arrest if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which can be a result of the VT. Maintaining adequate blood pressure is crucial to ensure proper organ perfusion.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: Prolonged periods of VT can lead to cardiogenic shock, characterized by poor cardiac output and hypoperfusion.
4. Arrhythmia Storm: The patient's VT storm indicates a high burden of recurrent VT episodes, which can further compromise cardiac function and increase the risk of complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to hospitalization and medical interventions may increase the risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Organ Dysfunction: Prolong"
