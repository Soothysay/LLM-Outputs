","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary, and an ampullary mass. He presents with septic shock, presumed secondary to cholangitis. The patient has a biliary stent in place, which may have been removed. There is also a possibility of partially treated enterococcus endocarditis, a PICC line infection, Clostridium difficile infection, urinary tract infection, aspiration pneumonia, or other healthcare-associated infections. The patient's lactate levels are trending down with intravenous fluids. 

The patient has anemia, likely due to recent bleeds from the necrotic ampullary/duodenal mass. His baseline creatinine level is 1.4-1.6, but it was noted to be 1.7 on admission and has since resolved back to baseline. The patient has a history of multiple malignancies, including bladder, colon (with recurrence), acoustic neuroma, and new metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary. The patient requires 24-hour assistance for all activities of daily living due to dementia and is currently living in a rehab facility. 

The patient has been started on IV fluids, repletion of electrolytes, and prophylaxis for pneumonia. He has multiple lines in place, including a peripheral IV, right internal jugular (IJ) line, and left per"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary, ampullary mass, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with septic shock, presumed secondary to cholangitis. The patient has a biliary stent in place, and there is dilation of the common bile duct suggesting obstruction. Other potential sources of infection include partially treated enterococcus endocarditis, PICC line infection, Clostridium difficile, urinary tract infection, aspiration pneumonia, or other healthcare-associated infections. The patient's lactate and anion gap are trending down with intravenous fluids. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Septic Shock: Discuss matters with family. Start Vancomycin/Zosyn. Follow up with blood and urine cultures. Consult for ERCP for stent placement or removal if the stent is occluded. Wean levophed as tolerated.
2. Anemia: Transfuse to Hct of 25. Check guaiac stools. Active T & S, crossmatch 2 units.
3. Renal Failure: Trend creatinine. Renally dose all medications.
4. Malignancy: Notify Onc team of patient's admission.
5. Dementia: Patient requires 24-hour assistance for all ADLs. Now living at a rehab facility since prior admission.
6. Code: DNR/DNI (confirmed with daughter).
7. Communication: Patient and patient's family (daughter, [Name (NI) 1677], [Name (NI) 12024], [Telephone/Fax (1) 11783] cell [Telephone/Fax (1) 12025] home).
8. Disposition: Pending clinical improvement of hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient may have cholangitis due to the obstruction of the common bile duct caused by the ampullary mass.
2. Enterococcus Endocarditis: The patient may have partially treated enterococcus endocarditis.
3. PICC Line Infection: There is a possibility of a PICC line infection.
4. Clostridium difficile: The patient may have Clostridium difficile infection.
5. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient may have a urinary tract infection.
6. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient may have aspiration pneumonia.
7. Healthcare-associated Infections: There is a risk of other healthcare-associated infections.
8. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia.
9. Renal Failure: The patient had renal failure, which has resolved now.
10. Malignancy: The patient has multiple malignancies.
11. Dementia: The patient has dementia and requires assistance for all ADLs.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, who presents with septic shock, presumed secondary to cholangitis. He also has a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and previous hemicolectomy. The patient's current condition includes agitation, hypertension, and cyanosis, which were temporarily managed with nitroglycerin but then developed hypotension. The family has decided against certain interventions such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and red blood cell transfusion. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 122 beats per minute, blood pressure fluctuating between 54/39 mmHg and 42/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the source of infection could potentially be a PICC line infection or healthcare-associated infections like C. difficile, urinary tract infection, or aspiration pneumonia. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Septic shock: The patient's presentation suggests septic shock, likely due to cholangitis caused by an obstructed biliary stent or ampullary mass.
2. Enterococcus endocarditis: There is a possibility of partially treated enter"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary, and an ampullary mass. He presents with septic shock, presumed secondary to cholangitis. The patient also has a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation with septic shock suggests a severe infection, likely secondary to cholangitis due to the ampullary mass predisposing him to recurrent infections. This requires immediate attention and aggressive treatment.
2. Healthcare Associated Infections: The patient could have partially treated enterococcus endocarditis, a PICC line infection, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), aspiration pneumonia (PNA), or other healthcare-associated infections. These should be monitored and treated accordingly.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of several recent bleeds, which are believed to be caused by the necrotic ampullary/duodenal mass. His hemoglobin levels are low, indicating iron deficiency anemia. Blood transfusions may be required to manage this condition.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.4-1.6, and it was noted to be 1.7 on admission. However,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary, and an ampullary mass. He presents with septic shock, presumed secondary to cholangitis. The patient has a biliary stent in place, which may predispose him to recurrent infections. He also has a history of partially treated enterococcus endocarditis, a possible PICC line infection, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), aspiration pneumonia (PNA), or other healthcare-associated infections. His lactate and anion gap are trending down with intravenous fluids (IVFs). The patient's family has decided to pursue medical management with antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn), IVFs, transfusion, and pressors as needed.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Septic shock - likely secondary to cholangitis due to the ampullary mass predisposing to recurrent infections. The patient had a biliary stent placed, but it is unclear if this stent was removed. A sonogram demonstrates common bile duct (CBD) dilation suggestive of obstruction (likely from the ampullary mass). Alternatively, may have partially treated enterococcus endocarditis (finished ampicillin course). Also, could have PICC line infection, C. diff, UTI, aspiration PNA, or other healthcare-associated infections. Lact"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old man known to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]; hx of colon ca, Bladder ca, liver mets
   (adeno of unknown origin). Slumped at nursing home. Brought to ED.
   Hypotensive. Elevated LFTs. Got 5 liters of fluid in ED; still
   requiring levophed with low SVR. Creat elevated to 1.7. On vanco,
   zosyn. CXR with probable RLL infiltrate. Patient had deteriorated over
   the course of admission and ERCP was not considered an option after
   discussion with family. Goals of care seemed to have changed overnight.
   He currently is hypotensive with acute renal failure, leukocytosis, new
   cholestatic picture, right sided abdominal pain.  Agree with IV
   hydration +/- pressor support if needed. He has a CVL. Family meeting
   today as below.
   Family Meeting
   I met with [**Last Name (LF) 1677**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], [**Doctor First Name 12046**] (children) and [**Name (NI) 149**] (son-in-law)
   today for a 35 minute meeting. Dr [**First Name (STitle) 5142**] was present as well. We updated
   the family on the issues and spent most of the meeting discussed goals
   of care.  The family expressed a consensus understanding that Mr
   [**Known lastname 11784**] would want to be living as long as his mental status remained
   in this state. By their report, he is oriented to person and place, but
   not to date. He is capable of laughing and expressing himself although
   not fully.  Understanding the overall poor prognosis due to his
   metastatic disease and recurrent cholangitis, the family would like for
   him to have maximal non-aggressive care. This is a change from the
   goals of care discussion which took place 2 days ago. He remains
   DNR/DNI but is not CMO.  Family appeared pleased with the discussion
   and understands that once hemodynamics improve, he will likely be
   transferred to the floor. All questions answered.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of colon cancer, bladder cancer, and liver metastasis (adenocarcinoma of unknown origin). He was brought to the emergency department after slumping at a nursing home and is now in the ICU. He has been hypotensive, received 5 liters of fluid, and is still requiring levophed with low SVR. His creatinine level has increased to 1.7, and he is on vancomycin and zosyn. There is a probable right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's condition has deteriorated over the course of admission, and ERCP was not considered an option after discussing with the family. The patient's goals of care seemed to have changed overnight. He currently has acute renal failure, leukocytosis, a new cholestatic picture, and right-sided abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates impaired kidney function, which can lead to complications such as fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased toxicity of certain medications, and the need for dialysis.

2. Right Lower Lobe Infiltrate: The presence of a probable right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests a possible pneumonia or lung infection. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, difficulty breathing, and potentially sepsis if the infection spreads.

3. Cholestatic Picture: The new"

","The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of colon cancer, bladder cancer, and liver metastasis (adenocarcinoma of unknown origin). He was slumped at the nursing home and brought to the emergency department. The patient is hypotensive, with elevated liver function tests, and has received approximately 5 liters of fluid. He requires levophed due to low systemic vascular resistance, and his creatinine level has risen to 1.7. The patient is currently on vancomycin and zosyn. A chest X-ray shows a probable right lower lobe infiltrate. 

The patient's condition has deteriorated over the course of admission, and ERCP was not considered an option after discussion with the family. The patient's goals of care seem to have changed overnight. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), a heart rate of 121 bpm (with a normal range of 67-121 bpm), a blood pressure of 95/49 mmHg (with a normal range of 71-100/40-64 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 18-32 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 18.9 K/uL (with a previous reading of 22.3 K/uL), a hematoc"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, bladder cancer, and liver metastasis. He was slumped at a nursing home and brought to the emergency department. The patient presented with hypotension and elevated liver function tests. He received approximately 5 liters of fluids in the emergency department and continues to require levophed due to low systemic vascular resistance. The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.7, and he is currently receiving vancomycin and zosyn. A chest X-ray revealed a probable right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to comfort care as the goal of treatment. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating do not resuscitate/do not intubate. The patient remains critically ill and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension, elevated liver function tests, and a chest X-ray showing a probable right lower lobe infiltrate suggests the possibility of sepsis. The presence of pneumonia can lead to a systemic inflammatory response and may progress to septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates impaired kidney function. AKI can occur due to factors such as hypotension, dehydration, or medications. Prompt identification and management of AKI are crucial to prevent"

   in [**Month (only) **] and it is unclear if this stent was removed. [**Name (NI) 4137**] sono
   demonstrates CBD dilitation suggestive of obstruction (likely from the
   ampullary mass).  Alternatively, may have partially treated
   enterococcus endocarditis (finished ampicillin course [**3-2**]).  Also,
   could have PICC line infection, C. diff, UTI, aspiration PNA or other
   healthcare associated infections.  Lactate and anion gap is trending
   down with IVFs by [**3-4**]. [**3-6**] family meeting decided to pursue medical

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, a recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary, and an ampullary mass. He presents with septic shock, likely secondary to cholangitis, and has undergone various interventions including biliary stent placement, antibiotic treatment, fluid resuscitation, and pressor support. 

The patient also has a history of iron deficiency anemia, renal failure, elevated INR, and dementia. His renal function is worsening, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels. The etiology of the elevated INR is unclear, with possibilities including liver dysfunction, malignancy-related deterioration, or a spurious lab value. 

The patient's overall condition is critical, with ongoing concerns regarding hypotension, infection, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction. His code status is DNR/DNI, indicating a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate decision. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's current presentation of hypotension and low urine output suggests ongoing septic shock, possibly secondary to cholangitis due to the ampullary mass. This condition can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and has a high mortality rate.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels, suggests acute kidney injury (ATN) possibly due to hyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, a recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary, and an ampullary mass. He presents with septic shock, presumed secondary to cholangitis. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including anemia, renal failure, elevated INR, and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely secondary to cholangitis due to the ampullary mass predisposing him to recurrent infections. There is also a possibility of partially treated enterococcus endocarditis, PICC line infection, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), urinary tract infection (UTI), aspiration pneumonia (PNA), or other healthcare-associated infections.

2. Anemia: The patient has a history of several recent bleeds felt to be secondary to the necrotic ampullary/duodenal mass. Prior labs are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. His last hematocrit (Hct) level is 33.3%.

3. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.4-1.6, but they have elevated to 2.3-2.6 in the last 24 hours, likely representing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. Poor urine output (UOP"

   Critical Care Addendum
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  80M with metastatic adenoca of unknown
   primary w/ ampullary mass p/w septic shock likely from cholangitis.
   Prolonged family mtg yesterday, decision to continue with current level
   of care, no further escalation.  Continues to decline overnight, more
   hypotensive, unresponsive to IVF bolus. Having runs of AVNRT,
   increasing with pressure uptitration.

   A/P: Pt continues to decline with progressive MODS.  He is more
   hypotensive despite uptitration of pressor [**Doctor Last Name **] and is not responding
   to IVF boluses. His rising cr, poor MS, and cool extremities suggest
   worsening forward flow/perfusion. His resp status appears more labored.
   Pt is DNR/DNI and we continue current level of care with no further
   escalation.We continue antbx, supplemental o2, and current
   vasopressor.  Will use pain medication for pt comfort, though this may
   impact his hypotension further. Would not further uptitrate his
   vasopressor given arrhythmias and cool, mottled extremities. We
   continue to update family and address goals of care given grim
   prognosis and declining status. Will consult with palliative care team.
   Remainder as per resident note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies including recurrent colon cancer, recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary, ampullary mass, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with septic shock, likely secondary to cholangitis. The patient has a biliary stent placed in [**Month (only) **] and it is unclear if this stent was removed. He also has a history of partially treated enterococcus endocarditis, possible PICC line infection, Clostridium difficile infection, urinary tract infection, aspiration pneumonia, or other healthcare-associated infections.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Septic shock: Likely secondary to cholangitis as the ampullary mass predisposes to recurrent infections. The patient had a biliary stent placed, but it is unclear if it was removed. There is also a possibility of partially treated enterococcus endocarditis or other healthcare-associated infections.
2. Anemia: The patient has a history of recent bleeds felt to be secondary to the necrotic ampullary/duodenal mass. Prior labs are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. His last hematocrit (Hct) level is 31.4.
3. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are 1.4-1.6, which have elevated to 2.3-2.8 in"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 80-year-old man with multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary, and an ampullary mass.
- The patient presented with septic shock, presumed secondary to cholangitis.
- He has a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease.
- The patient had a biliary stent placed, but it is unclear if it was removed.
- His current condition includes anemia, renal failure, elevated INR, and malignancy.
- The patient requires 24-hour assistance for all activities of daily living and has a baseline altered mental status.
- He is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, pressors as needed, and other medications.
- The patient's family has decided to pursue medical management instead of invasive procedures.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.
- The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement of hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Septic shock: The patient may experience worsening of his septic shock, leading to further organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Cholangitis: If the biliary stent was not removed, there is a risk of ongoing infection and potential complications such as liver abscess or bile duct obstruction.
3. Enterococcus endocarditis: There is a possibility of partially treated enterococcus endocarditis, which can lead to heart valve damage and"

1. Anemia: The patient has a history of recent bleeds due to the necrotic ampullary/duodenal mass. His last Hct was 33.3, indicating possible iron deficiency anemia. Monitoring the Hct trend is recommended.

2. Renal failure: The patient's baseline Cr level was 1.4-1.6, which has increased to 2.3-2.6 in the last 24 hours. This could represent acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. Poor urine output (UOP) is currently observed despite fluid challenges. Trending creatinine and adjusting medication dosages based on renal function are advised.

3. Elevated INR: The patient's INR has increased from a baseline of 1.3 to 2.4. The etiology is unclear, and it could represent deterioration of liver synthetic function from malignancy or a spurious lab value. Checking fibrinogen and rechecking INR are recommended.

4. Malignancy: The patient has multiple malignancies, including bladder, colon ("

   in [**Month (only) **] and it is unclear if this stent was removed. [**Name (NI) 4137**] sono
   demonstrates CBD dilitation suggestive of obstruction (likely from the
   ampullary mass).  Alternatively, may have partially treated
   enterococcus endocarditis (finished ampicillin course [**3-2**]).  Also,
   could have PICC line infection, C. diff, UTI, aspiration PNA or other
   healthcare associated infections.  Lactate and anion gap is trending
   down with IVFs by [**3-4**]. [**3-6**] family meeting decided to pursue medical
   management with abx, IVF, transfusion, and pressors as needed.

","The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary, and an ampullary mass. He presents with septic shock, likely secondary to cholangitis. The patient has several potential medical complications based on the information provided:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is likely secondary to cholangitis. This condition can lead to organ failure and a poor prognosis if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Anemia: The patient has a history of recent bleeds felt to be secondary to the necrotic ampullary/duodenal mass. Prior labs are consistent with iron deficiency anemia, and his last Hct level is 31.4. Trending Hct levels will be important to monitor for further assessment and management of anemia.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are 1.4-1.6, but they have elevated to 2.3-2.8 in the last 48 hours, likely representing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. Poor urine output currently despite fluid challenge indicates potential renal failure. Trending creatinine levels and dosing medications accordingly will be important.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary, and ampullary mass. He presents with septic shock, likely secondary to cholangitis. The patient has several comorbidities such as hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He is currently admitted to the ICU for medical management with antibiotics, intravenous fluids, transfusion, and pressors as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to multiple organ failure if not promptly managed.
2. Cholangitis: The patient's ampullary mass predisposes him to recurrent infections, and cholangitis may be the underlying cause of his septic shock.
3. Enterococcus Endocarditis: The patient may have partially treated enterococcus endocarditis, as suggested by the recent completion of an ampicillin course.
4. PICC Line Infection: There is a possibility of a PICC line infection, which can lead to bacteremia and sepsis.
5. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) Infection: The patient may be at risk for developing C. diff infection due to antibiotic use.
6. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's current condition makes him susceptible to UTI.

2. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels have increased from 1.4-1.6 to 2.3-3.3 in the last 72 hours, indicating acute kidney injury (ATN) likely due to hypotension. Poor urine output despite fluid challenge suggests oliguria, which can be a sign of worsening renal function.

3. Elevated INR: The patient's INR has increased from a baseline of 1.3 to 2.9. This could indicate deterioration of liver synthetic function from malignancy or hypotension. It may increase the risk of bleeding and clotting disorders.

4. Malignancy: The patient has multiple malignancies, including bladder, colon (with recurrence), acoustic neuroma, and new metastatic aden"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, which is secondary to cholangitis due to an ampullary mass predisposing to recurrent infections. The presence of a biliary stent and CBD dilation suggests obstruction, possibly from the ampullary mass.

2. Anemia: The patient has a history of recent bleeds, which are felt to be secondary to the necrotic ampullary/duodenal mass. Prior labs are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The last Hct level is 32.0.

3. Renal failure: The patient's baseline Cr levels range from 1.4-1.6, but have increased to 2.3-3.3 in the last 72 hours, likely representing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. The patient is currently oliguric despite fluid challenge.

4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR has increased from a baseline of 1.3 to 2.9. The cause is unclear, but it could represent deterioration of liver synthetic function from malignancy or hypotension. DIC is unlikely as Hct and Plt are stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary, and an ampullary mass. He presents with septic shock, presumed secondary to cholangitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are:

1. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, likely due to cholangitis caused by the ampullary mass obstructing the common bile duct. This can lead to recurrent infections and further complications if not properly managed.

2. Anemia: The patient has a history of recent bleeds secondary to the necrotic ampullary/duodenal mass. His last hematocrit (Hct) level was 32.0, indicating anemia. Iron deficiency anemia may also be present, as suggested by prior labs.

3. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were within normal range (1.4-1.6), but they have elevated to 2.3-3.3 in the last 72 hours. This increase in creatinine suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and poor urine output.

4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR has increased from a baseline of 1.3 to 2.9. The cause of this elevation is unclear, but it"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple malignancies
   including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and recent
   metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary and ampullary mass, HTN,
   & CKD who presents with septic shock, presumed secondary to
   cholangitis.
   .
   # septic shock
 Likely secondary to cholangitis as ampullary mass will
   predispose to recurrent infections.  Patient had a biliary stent placed
   in [**Month (only) **] and it is unclear if this stent was removed. [**Name (NI) 4137**] sono
   demonstrates CBD dilitation suggestive of obstruction (likely from the
   ampullary mass).  Alternatively, may have partially treated
   enterococcus endocarditis (finished ampicillin course [**3-2**]).  Also,
   could have PICC line infection, C. diff, UTI, aspiration PNA or other
   healthcare associated infections.  Lactate and anion gap is trending
   down with IVFs by [**3-4**]. [**3-6**] family meeting decided to pursue medical
   management with abx, IVF, transfusion, and pressors as needed.
   - Vanc/Zosyn D8, D1=[**3-3**] (Vanc level still therapeutic despite being
   d/ced
 now only on zosyn)
   - monitor UOP
   - per goals of care discussion and discussion on rounds, continue but
   do not escalate pressors
   .
   # anemia
 Patient has history of several recent bleeds felt to be
   secondary to the necrotic ampullary/duodenal mass.  Prior [**2-6**] labs
   consistent with iron deficiency anemia.  Last Hct 32.0.
   - trend Hct
   .
   # renal failure
  Baseline Cr 1.4-1.6.  Cr elevated to 2.3 -3.3 in
   last 72 hours, likely represents ATN [**1-4**] hypotension.  Poor UOP
   currently despite fluid challenge; now oliguric.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   # elevated INR
 2.9 from baseline of 1.3.  Unclear etiology.  Could
   represent deterioration of liver synthetic function from malignancy or
   hypotension.  DIC unlikely as Hct, Plt stable.
   - check fibrinogen
   - recheck INR
   .
   # malignancy
 Patient with multiple malignancies including bladder,
   colon (with recurrence), acoustic neuroma, and new metastatic adenoca
   with unknown primary with meds to the liver, large pericardial
   effusion, and necrotic ampullary mass.  Onc consulted on prior
   admission and felt that he was not a candidate for therapy.
   - no active management
   .
   # dementia
 At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.  Now living at a rehab facility since prior
   admission.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, recent metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary, and ampullary mass. He presents with septic shock, presumed secondary to cholangitis. The patient also has several other medical conditions such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, iron deficiency anemia, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for recurrent infections due to his underlying malignancies, especially the ampullary mass which can predispose him to cholangitis. Additionally, there is a possibility of healthcare-associated infections such as PICC line infection, Clostridium difficile colitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or others.

2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine levels between 1.4-1.6. His recent creatinine levels have risen to 2.3-3.3, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN) likely secondary to hypotension. Oliguria is also present, indicating poor urine output despite fluid challenges.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR from 1.3 to 2.9 suggests a deterioration of liver synthetic function. This could be due to malignancy or hypotension. Fibrinogen levels should be checked to"
