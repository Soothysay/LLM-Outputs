   Chief Complaint: ARDS
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient's vent settings were changed from the following:
   CMV/Assist; FiO2%:100; ; TV:450; PEEP:12; Temp:37.6 Lactate:2.3
   pH 7.23 pCO2 54 pO2  70 HCO3 24 BaseXS -5
   CMV/Assist; FiO2%:100; AADO2:607; Req:99; TV:400; PEEP:12;
    pH7.32 pCO2 49 pO2 60 HCO3 26
   to the ARDSnet protocol as below to prevent lung overexpansion.
   FiO2%:100; AADO2:592; Req:97; Rate:/22; TV:280; Temp:38.2
   pH 7.28 pCO2 54 pO2 70 HCO326 BaseXS -1
   She began to drop her O2 sats on the vent settings so multiple vent
   adjustments were made to bring up her O2 sats.  The following vent
   settings allowed her to stablilize at 85% and she was kept on these the
   remainder of the evening.

   FINDINGS: Supine portable chest x-rays compared with [**2151-10-30**].
   The endotracheal tube terminates 4.4 cm above the carina. The
   orogastric tube is in satisfactory position. There are diffuse
   bilateral airspace opacifications, increased from previous study,
   consistent with pulmonary edema. Again seen is cardiomegaly. No
   pneumothorax is appreciated.
   ABDOMINAL U/S [**2151-10-30**]
   1. Mild gallbladder wall thickening with no intraluminal gallstones
   identified and trace free fluid in the right upper quadrant. These
   findings
   are nonspecific.
   2. Hepatic steatosis with sparing adjacent to the gallbladder fossa.
   3. Normal-appearing kidneys without evidence of hydronephrosis.
   Microbiology: DFA negative, but d/t amount of Poly's had to send to lab
   for definitive results

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   .
   # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of R sided
   pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal
   ventilatory support.  Likely d/t bacterial pneumonia because gm (+)
   cocci found in sputum.   Does have evidence of bronchospasm/asthma
   flare.  No evidence of volume overload.   Esophageal balloon in now.
   - proning was discussed and felt would be a fatal intervention in her
   - Continue to vent while paralyzed on cisatracurarium
   - Attempt following vent inrterventions to improve oxygenation:
   increase PEEP despite esophageal balloon settings, pressure control,
   APRV.  If those fail may consider NO or ECMO
   - Antibacterial coverage with levoflox, ceftriaxone for CAP plus vanco
   to cover staph.
   - Antiviral coverage with oseltamavir; start peramivir.
   - Sputum culture f/u final results- gram + cocci right now
   - Nasal swab for flu was neg here and sent to state lab for final
   results b/c of poly
   - Unable to bronch for r/o AEP or [**Last Name (un) 10044**], consider in future.
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; consider
   repeat Mag.
   - Check TTE with bubble.
   - Blood transfusion to help oxygenation.  Fluids as needed
   .
   # ARF.  Looks dry on initial exam.  s/p 2 liters in ED.  Likely
   prerenal/hypovolemic and FeNa of 0.2 suggests prerenal.  Abdominal u/s
   showed no hydronephrosis
   - Continue to trend.
   - Stop Lasix and give fluids (1 u PRBC as needed)
   .
   # Abdominal pain.  Presenting to ED with abdominal pain - may be truly
   reflection of RLL pneumonia.  LFTs normal.  KUB nonspecific.  Portable
   u/s showed non-specific gallbladder wall thickening and some free fluid
   - Possible CT abdomen if stabilizes.
   .
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Rising again since ED.  Likely infectious related as
   above.
   - f/u cultures.
   - continue to trend.
   .
   # Hyponatremia.  Likely hypovolemic based on initial assessment of
   volume status.  Improving after getting saline in ED.
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # DM type II. On high doses of insulin at home.
   - Insulin gtt.
   - Hold metformin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and asthma. She presented to the emergency department (ED) with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate (HR) of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 120/68 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 86%.

The patient is currently intubated, paralyzed, and sedated. She has pinpoint pupils that are sluggishly reactive to light. Physical examination findings include normal breath sounds on the left side and some wheezing on the right side, with movement of air. No murmurs are heard, and there is mild abdominal distension with normal bowel sounds. No edema is present in the lower extremities, and pulses are present.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.3 thousand/mmÂ³, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 94 to 157 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 134 mg/dL. Other laboratory values are within normal limits or nonspecific.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma who presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain. He developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's ventilatory support has been maximal, and he requires paralysis due to severe ARDS. There is evidence of bronchospasm/asthma flare, but no evidence of volume overload. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and elevated blood glucose levels. Imaging findings include diffuse bilateral airspace opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. The abdominal ultrasound showed mild gallbladder wall thickening, trace free fluid in the right upper quadrant, hepatic steatosis, and normal-appearing kidneys without evidence of hydronephrosis. The patient's sputum culture revealed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The assessment and plan include respiratory failure/ARDS, possible pneumonia, bronchospasm/asthma flare, and consideration of pulmonary embolism. The patient will continue to receive ventilatory support while paralyzed, undergo prone positioning, and have ARDSnet volumes titrated based on esophageal balloon results. Antibacterial coverage has been initiated, as well as antiviral coverage for influenza. Further investigations include a nasal swab for influenza, sputum culture follow-up, and consideration of a CT abdomen if the patient stabilizes."

   1.       Respiratory failure with refractory hypoxemia. PRVC vent.
   Maintain paralysis, deep sedation. Will attempt PC and APRV to attempt
   to improve oxygenation. If vent changes fail to improve sat will
   consider NO, proning and possibly ECMO.
   2.       PNA. Sputum GPC. Extremely rapid progression, unidentified

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of asthma. He presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and rapidly developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been treated empirically for H1N1/viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and other possible causes such as extrapulmonary infection/sepsis, acute exacerbation of asthma, or other noninfectious pneumonitis.

24-hour events include a change to ARDSnet ventilation with a tidal volume of 280 mL, a PEEP of 12 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 1.0. The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to the mid-80s, so the tidal volume was increased to 350 mL and the inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio was increased. The patient remains on levophed, insulin drip, and Lasix at 10 cc/hour.

The patient's allergies include ACE inhibitors, gemfibrozil, myalgias, and eleva. He is currently unable to provide history as he is sedated and unresponsive.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 89/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 5"

The patient's condition has been critical, with refractory hypoxemia requiring high levels of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). He has been paralyzed and sedated to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Various interventions have been attempted to improve oxygenation, including prone ventilation (PRVC), partial liquid ventilation (PLV), and airway pressure release ventilation (APRV). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been considered as a last resort.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and elevated lactate levels. His blood glucose levels have been elevated, and he has been receiving an insulin infusion for glycemic control. Fluid balance has been closely monitored, with ongoing losses through various routes.

The patient's abdominal pain may be related to right lower lobe pneumonia. Further imaging, such as an abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT), may be warranted. The patient's history of"

   renal [**Last Name (un) 10085**] damage.
   # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of R sided
   pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal
   ventilatory support.  Likely d/t bacterial pneumonia because gm (+)
   cocci found in sputum. Yesterday was tried on NO, APRV, and then PRVC.
   - Proning was discussed and felt would be a fatal intervention in her,
   so this was not done yesterday
   - Continue to vent while paralyzed on cisatracurarium
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to consider ECMO

   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs
   - Blood transfusion to help oxygenation.  Fluids as needed
   # Shock. Very concerning for septic shock with GNR's in urine and GPC's
   in sputum on admission. Less likely cardiogenic shock given warm
   extremities. On broad spectrum ABx as above. CVP 23. She also has
   evidence of end organ ischemia with rising LFT's, rising Cr, elevated
   Trops
   - Continues on pressors to keep MAP >60 --> at present, Neo and Levo
   have been weaned overnight and pt is only on Vasopressin
   - Need to get echo with bubble study today to assess for cardiogenic
   shock
   - Need CvO2 today
   - Continue ABx as above, f/u Cx's
   - IVF's as needed, would use IVF with bicarb to help with metabolic
   acidosis, or could also use blood products.
   # Metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate. Unsure where the etiology
   of her acute decompensation and subsequent acidosis with elevated
   lactate came from. Had abd XR [**10-29**] showing possible evolving
   obstruction picture, but repeat abd xray last night did not show
   dilated loops of bowel. Also concerning would be bowel perforation but
   no free air is seen on most recent abd ray or CXR
   - F/u final Xray read
   - If stable from hemodynamics perspective, could consider CT torso, but
   unsure if this will change management, as she is not an operative
   candidate now if she had a perforation or an abscess
   - IVF's with bicarb
   - ABx as above
   # Respiratory acidosis. Currently being mechanically ventilated. Will
   adjust settings to keep CO2 40-50.
   # Elevated Troponins - More likely is due to global ischemia than ACS,
   as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple organs.
   - Trend Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   - Needs echo today to assess for wall motion abnmls
   - Daily EKGs
   # Hyperglycemia. Blood sugars running in the 600-700's despite 40U/hr
   insulin gtt and several 10-20U boluses. Most likely due to the 3L D5W
   with bicarb to address acidosis, but could be stress response to shock.
   - Will check for ketone bodies which could be contributing to metabolic
   acidosis although they were note seen on most recent UA
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars
   - If fluids needed consider blood products as opposed to further
   dextrose with bicarb
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   # Leukocytosis.  Rising again since ED.  Likely infectious related as
   above.
   - f/u cultures.
   - continue to trend.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma.
- She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has been on maximal ventilatory support and has shown increasing ventilatory requirements.
- She has evidence of liver and renal damage, with nonspecific gallbladder wall thickening, periportal edema, hepatic steatosis, and normal-appearing kidneys without evidence of hydronephrosis.
- The patient also has a right lower lobe pneumonia with pleural effusion.
- She has signs of septic shock with gram-negative rods in urine and gram-positive cocci in sputum.
- Blood cultures are pending, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.
- The patient's condition has deteriorated rapidly, with evolving metabolic lactic acidosis, respiratory acidosis, and shock.
- She is on multiple pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, and vasopressin has been weaned overnight.
- An echocardiogram with bubble study is needed to assess for cardiogenic shock.
- There is concern for a possible evolving obstruction or bowel perforation, but no free air is seen on the most recent abdominal X-ray or chest X-ray.
- The patient's elevated Troponins are more likely due to global ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, now with increasing vent requirements, and evolving
   metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with
   evidence of liver and renal organ damage.
   # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of R sided
   pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal
   ventilatory support.  Likely d/t bacterial pneumonia because gm (+)
   cocci found in sputum. Yesterday was tried on NO, APRV, and then PRVC.
   - Proning was discussed and felt would be a fatal intervention in her,
   so this was not done yesterday
   - Continue to vent while paralyzed on cisatracurarium
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to consider ECMO
   - Tomorrow we will start to wean the NO
   - ABx coverage with Levaquin (started [**10-29**]), Vanc (started [**10-30**]),
   Cefepime (started [**10-31**]), and Flagyl (started [**10-31**])
   - Have ordered IV Peramivir from CDC, will f/u.
   - F/u flu results sent to state lab
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs
 today we
   will start to wean the IV Solumedrol
   - Blood transfusion to help oxygenation.  Fluids as needed
   # Shock. Very concerning for septic shock with GNR's in urine and GPC's
   in sputum on admission. Less likely cardiogenic shock given warm
   extremities. On broad spectrum ABx as above. CVP 23. She also has
   evidence of end organ ischemia with rising LFT's, rising Cr, elevated
   Trops
   - Continues on pressors to keep MAP >60 --> at present, Neo and Levo
   have been weaned overnight and pt is only on Vasopressin
   - Need to get echo with bubble study today to assess for cardiogenic
   shock
   - Need CvO2 today
 DONE 77%
   - Continue ABx as above, f/u Cx's
   - IVF's as needed, would use IVF with bicarb to help with metabolic
   acidosis, or could also use blood products.
   # Metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate. Unsure where the etiology
   of her acute decompensation and subsequent acidosis with elevated
   lactate came from. Had abd XR [**10-29**] showing possible evolving
   obstruction picture, but repeat abd xray last night did not show
   dilated loops of bowel. Also concerning would be bowel perforation but
   no free air is seen on most recent abd ray or CXR
   - F/u final Xray read
   - If stable from hemodynamics perspective and possibly able to go,
   could consider CT torso, but unsure if this will change management, as
   she is not an operative candidate now if she had a perforation or an
   abscess
   - IVF's with bicarb
   - ABx as above
   # Respiratory acidosis. Currently being mechanically ventilated. Will
   adjust settings to keep CO2 40-50.
   # Elevated Troponins - More likely is due to global ischemia than ACS,
   as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple organs.
   - Trend Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   - Needs echo today to assess for wall motion abnmls
   - Daily EKGs
   # Hyperglycemia. Blood sugars running in the 600-700's despite 40U/hr
   insulin gtt and several 10-20U boluses. Most likely due to the 3L D5W
   with bicarb to address acidosis, but could be stress response to shock.
   - Will check for ketone bodies which could be contributing to metabolic
   acidosis although they were note seen on most recent UA
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars
   - If fluids needed consider blood products as opposed to further
   dextrose with bicarb
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   # Leukocytosis.  Rising again since ED.  Likely infectious related as
   above.
   - f/u cultures.
   - continue to trend.
   - ABx as above

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She also has evidence of right-sided pneumonia and has been placed on maximal ventilatory support. 

The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated, and she is now experiencing multi-organ dysfunction. She has metabolic lactic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, renal impairment, and evidence of liver and renal damage on imaging. 

She is also showing signs of shock, with warm extremities but low blood pressure. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there is a concern for septic shock given the presence of GNRs in her urine and GPCs in her sputum. 

The patient's blood sugar levels are extremely high, running in the 600-700s despite high doses of insulin. This is likely due to the large volume of dextrose given to address her metabolic acidosis, but could also be a stress response to shock. 

Her troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac ischemia, although the overall clinical picture suggests widespread hypoperfusion of multiple organs rather than acute coronary syndrome. 

There is a history of difficult intubation, requiring six attempts in the emergency department and subsequent bronchoscopic placement. 

The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to an infectious process. 

She is currently on multiple pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure, and an echocardiogram with bubble study is planned to assess for cardiogenic shock. 

Given her unstable condition and the need for further evaluation and management, the patient will remain in the ICU."

   Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis and respiratory acidosis.  Can stop HCO3,

   HOTN:  Worthwhile getting an echo with a bubble study to assess for
   cardiac function, pulm HTN, and also shunts given response to NO, and

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, now with increasing vent requirements, and evolving
   metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with
   evidence of liver and renal organ damage.
   # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient had desaturation episodes
   yesterday triggering PEA arrests but now stabilized.  Patient presented
   with evidence of lobar R sided pneumonia with rapid progression to
   severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support.
   - Is back on cisatricurium, which we will trial stopping daily.
   - Continue to wean the NO
   - ABx coverage currently with Levaquin (started [**10-29**]), Vanc (started
   [**10-30**]), Cefepime (started [**10-31**]), and Flagyl (started [**10-31**]).  Gut
   flora as source seems less likely and pt cdiff negative so we will d/c
   Flagyl.
   - Patient receiving Peramivir.  Can d/c if state lab flu PCR negative.
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs
 continue
   to wean solumedrol halving dose again today.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient
s situation is very tenuous and
   she decompensates precipitously in setting of hypoxia, presumably due
   to vagal vasodilation.  Responds well to epinephrine.  She does have
   evidence of end-organ damage on labs, with rising Cr and
   transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as she stabilizes to trend
   for improvement.
   # Rising creatinine: patient has slowly rising creatinine, almost
   definitely hypoperfusion during PEA arrest.  If persists, check urine
   lytes and sediment.
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest yesterday, but
   with stable ECGs, we will not be intervening.
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   # Respiratory alkalosis: adjusted this morning by lowering tidal
   volumes.  Can also decrease respiratory rate as tolerated.  She will
   also benefit from increasing PEEP and lowering FiO2.
   # Hyperglycemia. Blood sugars running in the 600-700's despite 40U/hr
   insulin gtt and several 10-20U boluses. Most likely due to the 3L D5W
   with bicarb to address acidosis, but could be stress response to shock.
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   FEN: bolus IVFs prn, replete electrolytes, we have been holding TF
s in
   the setting of abdominal distention, likely ileus from cisatracurium.
   We can consider TPN if she remains paralyzed tomorrow.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin and IV PPI

","Summary:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possible right pneumonia.
- The patient experienced multiple episodes of desaturation triggering pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests but is now stabilized.
- The patient is currently intubated and on maximal ventilatory support.
- She has evidence of liver and renal organ damage.
- The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics for bacterial coverage, including cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.
- She is also receiving peramivir for suspected influenza.
- The patient's condition is very tenuous and she decompensates precipitously in the setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation. She responds well to epinephrine.
- She has evidence of end-organ damage on labs, with rising creatinine and transaminitis. Will continue to check labs as she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
- The patient's troponin levels are elevated, almost definitely due to global ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS). There are widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple organs. Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
- The patient has hyperglycemia despite receiving insulin, likely due to the large volume of dextrose in her intravenous fluids or"

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, now with increasing vent requirements, and evolving
   metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with
   evidence of liver and renal organ damage.
   # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of R sided
   pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal
   ventilatory support.  Likely d/t bacterial pneumonia because gm (+)
   cocci found in sputum. Yesterday was tried on NO, APRV, and then PRVC.
   - Proning was discussed and felt would be a fatal intervention in her,
   so this was not done yesterday
   - Continue to vent while paralyzed on cisatracurarium
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to consider ECMO
   - Tomorrow we will start to wean the NO
   - ABx coverage with Levaquin (started [**10-29**]), Vanc (started [**10-30**]),
   Cefepime (started [**10-31**]), and Flagyl (started [**10-31**])
   - Have ordered IV Peramivir from CDC, will f/u.
   - F/u flu results sent to state lab
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs
 today we
   will start to wean the IV Solumedrol
   - Blood transfusion to help oxygenation.  Fluids as needed
   # Shock. Very concerning for septic shock with GNR's in urine and GPC's
   in sputum on admission. Less likely cardiogenic shock given warm
   extremities. On broad spectrum ABx as above. CVP 23. She also has
   evidence of end organ ischemia with rising LFT's, rising Cr, elevated
   Trops
   - Continues on pressors to keep MAP >60 --> at present, Neo and Levo
   have been weaned overnight and pt is only on Vasopressin
   - Need to get echo with bubble study today to assess for cardiogenic
   shock
   - Need CvO2 today
 DONE 77%
   - Continue ABx as above, f/u Cx's
   - IVF's as needed, would use IVF with bicarb to help with metabolic
   acidosis, or could also use blood products.
   # Metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate. Unsure where the etiology
   of her acute decompensation and subsequent acidosis with elevated
   lactate came from. Had abd XR [**10-29**] showing possible evolving
   obstruction picture, but repeat abd xray last night did not show
   dilated loops of bowel. Also concerning would be bowel perforation but
   no free air is seen on most recent abd ray or CXR
   - F/u final Xray read
   - If stable from hemodynamics perspective and possibly able to go,
   could consider CT torso, but unsure if this will change management, as
   she is not an operative candidate now if she had a perforation or an
   abscess
   - IVF's with bicarb
   - ABx as above
   # Respiratory acidosis. Currently being mechanically ventilated. Will
   adjust settings to keep CO2 40-50.
   # Elevated Troponins - More likely is due to global ischemia than ACS,
   as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple organs.
   - Trend Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   - Needs echo today to assess for wall motion abnmls
   - Daily EKGs
   # Hyperglycemia. Blood sugars running in the 600-700's despite 40U/hr
   insulin gtt and several 10-20U boluses. Most likely due to the 3L D5W
   with bicarb to address acidosis, but could be stress response to shock.
   - Will check for ketone bodies which could be contributing to metabolic
   acidosis although they were note seen on most recent UA
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars
   - If fluids needed consider blood products as opposed to further
   dextrose with bicarb
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   # Leukocytosis.  Rising again since ED.  Likely infectious related as
   above.
   - f/u cultures.
   - continue to trend.
   - ABx as above

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and subsequently developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is evidence of right-sided pneumonia, and gram-positive cocci were found in the sputum. The patient has been on maximal ventilatory support and has required paralysis with cisatracurium. ABx coverage has been started, including Levaquin, Vanc, Cefepime, and Flagyl.

The patient is also showing signs of shock, with GNRs in the urine and GPCs in the sputum on admission. She has evidence of end-organ ischemia, as indicated by rising liver function tests (LFTs), rising creatinine, and elevated troponin levels. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and she is on pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Vasopressin has been weaned overnight.

An echocardiogram with bubble study is needed today to assess for cardiogenic shock. A central venous oxygen saturation (CvO2) measurement is also required. The patient's metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate levels needs further investigation, and a CT torso may be considered if she is stable hemodynamically.

The patient's elevated troponin levels are more likely"

   Respiratory failure:  Severe PNA and ARDS.
   Move ETT back.  Is very fragile and marginal.  Will continue current
   settings and increase PEEP.
   Call state lab for Influenza results.  Continue antibiotics.
   Try and wean off paralytics today again.
   Cardiac arrests:  likely due to respiratory arrest due to thick
   secretions.  Has been stable since.  Bronch is too high risk currently.
   Shock:  improved.
   ARF:  Increasing creatinine likely due to episode of HOTN yesterday.
   Hyperglycemia:  improved.
   Atsthma:  continue to wean steroids.

   Nutrition: Will try and take off paralytic today and see if we can TF.
   If not, we will opt for TPN.

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia or unclear etiology. The patient experienced two cardiac arrests overnight, both of which were successfully resuscitated. The patient has been stabilized and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 320 mL, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 90%. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but her heart rate is elevated at 130 beats per minute. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 38.3 degrees Celsius, and her white blood cell count is elevated at 19.3 K/uL. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 285 mg/dL. The patient has a history of allergies to ACE inhibitors and gemfibrozil. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, insulin, and cisatracurium. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains unresponsive. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T and creatinine, as well as low levels of potassium and calcium.

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, now with increasing vent requirements, and evolving
   metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with
   evidence of liver and renal organ damage.
   # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar R
   sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal
   ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 2 PEA arrests 2 days ago and a
   prolonged episode of instability yesterday of desaturation,
   hypotension, bradycardia followed by HTN and tachy x2, requiring shocks
   x2 and pressors.
   - Continue PRVC for now with attempts to wean FiO2 first
   - Discontinue levophed
   - Pt continues on Cisatra, would continue today
   - Try to wean down NO by
 then try to wean completely.
   - Will diurese with 20mg IV Lasix for now, aim to get more access so we
   can have Lasix gtt.
   - ABx coverage currently with Levaquin (started [**10-29**]), Vanc (started
   [**10-30**]), Cefepime (started [**10-31**]).
   - Cdiff negative and gut flora as source seems less likely, Flagyl has
   been stopped.
   - Patient receiving Peramivir.  State lab results are negative for H1N1
   but we are continuing empirically
 finish 5 day course, today is day
   #3.
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; decrease
   Solumedrol to 15 q8h
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient
s situation is very tenuous and
   she decompensates precipitously in setting of hypoxia, presumably due
   to vagal vasodilation.  Responds well to epinephrine.  She does have
   evidence of end-organ damage on labs, with rising Cr and
   transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as she stabilizes to trend
   for improvement.
   - Need to talk to family and fully explain the gravity of her situation
   and discuss her code status. She remains full code for now.
   # Rising creatinine: patient has slowly rising creatinine, almost
   definitely hypoperfusion during PEA arrest.
   - Check urine lytes and sediment today
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest yesterday, but
   with stable ECGs, we will not be intervening.
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Normal CO2 and elevated HCO3's on this morning's
   ABG. Most likely a response to recent respiratory acidosis.
   - If continues would consider Acetazolamide but will continue to
   maximize respiratory status
   # Continued febrility: Pt with fever curve trending up. Currently on
   Levaquin, Vanc, Cefepime, and Peramivir.
   # Respiratory alkalosis: adjusted this morning by lowering tidal
   volumes.  Can also decrease respiratory rate as tolerated.  She will
   also benefit from increasing PEEP and lowering FiO2.
   # Hyperglycemia. Blood sugars running in the 600-700's despite 40U/hr
   insulin gtt and several 10-20U boluses. Most likely due to the 3L D5W
   with bicarb to address acidosis, but could be stress response to shock.
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   FEN: Bolus IVFs prn, replete electrolytes, we have been holding TF
s in
   the setting of abdominal distention, likely ileus from cisatracurium.
   Hold on TPN for now, as without extra access that would be necessary.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; change from H2 blocker to IV PPI
   Access: Has new L art line, R IJ and 2 peripherals
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family.
   Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 10086**] speaks English and understands the
   situation, was informed of acute decline last night. Phone numbers are
   in board in room
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type I, hypertension, and asthma.
2. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. The patient required maximal ventilatory support and had two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests, which were successfully resuscitated.
4. She also experienced an episode of hemodynamic instability with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypertension, requiring two shocks.
5. The patient has a fever curve trending up despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
6. She has a history of difficult intubation, requiring six attempts and bronchoscopic placement.
7. Her blood glucose levels are running in the 600-700's despite insulin therapy.
8. The patient has rising creatinine, indicating possible hypoperfusion during the PEA arrests.
9. Elevated troponin levels are likely due to global ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome.
10. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, requiring adjustments in ventilator settings.
11. She has metabolic alkalosis with normal CO2 and elevated HCO3 on ABG.
12. The patient's condition is tenuous, and she remains full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure/ARDS"

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, now with increasing vent requirements, and evolving
   metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with
   evidence of liver and renal organ damage.
   # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar R
   sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal
   ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 2 PEA arrests 2 days ago and a
   prolonged episode of instability yesterday of desaturation,
   hypotension, bradycardia followed by HTN and tachy x2, requiring shocks
   x2 and pressors.
   - Continue PRVC for now with attempts to wean FiO2 first
   - Discontinue levophed
   - Pt continues on Cisatra, would continue today
   - Try to wean down NO
   - ABx coverage currently with Levaquin (started [**10-29**]), Vanc (started
   [**10-30**]), Cefepime (started [**10-31**]).
   - Cdiff negative and gut flora as source seems less likely, Flagyl has
   been stopped.
   - Patient receiving Peramivir.  State lab results are negative for H1N1
   but we are continuing empirically
 finish 5 day course, today is day
   #3.
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; decrease
   Solumedrol to 15 q8h
   - Diuresis with lasix 20mg IV for now; aim to get more access so can
   have lasix gtt
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient
s situation is very tenuous and
   she decompensates precipitously in setting of hypoxia, presumably due
   to vagal vasodilation.  Responds well to epinephrine.  She does have
   evidence of end-organ damage on labs, with rising Cr and
   transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as she stabilizes to trend
   for improvement.
   - Need to talk to family and fully explain the gravity of her situation
   and discuss her code status. She remains full code for now.
   # Rising creatinine: patient has slowly rising creatinine, almost
   definitely hypoperfusion during PEA arrest.
   - Check urine lytes and sediment today
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest yesterday, but
   with stable ECGs, we will not be intervening.
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Normal CO2 and elevated HCO3's on this morning's
   ABG. Most likely a response to recent respiratory acidosis.
   - If continues would consider Acetazolamide but will continue to
   maximize respiratory status
   # Continued febrility: Pt with fever curve trending up. Currently on
   Levaquin, Vanc, Cefepime, and Peramivir.
   # Respiratory alkalosis: adjusted this morning by lowering tidal
   volumes.  Can also decrease respiratory rate as tolerated.  She will
   also benefit from increasing PEEP and lowering FiO2.
   # Hyperglycemia. Blood sugars running in the 600-700's despite 40U/hr
   insulin gtt and several 10-20U boluses. Most likely due to the 3L D5W
   with bicarb to address acidosis, but could be stress response to shock.
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   FEN: Bolus IVFs prn, replete electrolytes, we have been holding TF
s in
   the setting of abdominal distention, likely ileus from cisatracurium.
   Hold on TPN for now, as without extra access that would be necessary.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; change from H2 blocker to IV PPI
   Access: Has new L art line, R IJ and 2 peripherals
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family.
   Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 10086**] speaks English and understands the

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by lobar right-sided pneumonia. She has experienced multiple episodes of hypoxia, hypotension, bradycardia, and hypertension, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and pressor support. Her condition is complicated by fever of unknown origin (FUO), metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis, shock, constipation, ineffective coping, and electrolyte/fluid disorders.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient presented with severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. Continuous PRVC mode with attempts to wean FiO2 first is recommended. Discontinuation of levophed and weaning down NO should be considered.
2. Hypotension and Shock: The patient has had multiple episodes of hypotension and shock, requiring CPR and pressor support. She responds well to epinephrine. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic stability is crucial.
3. Rising Creatinine: The patient has a slowly rising creatinine, likely due to hypoperfusion during PEA arrest. Renal function should be closely monitored, and urine electrolytes and sediment should be checked today.
4. Elevated Troponins: The elevated troponins are most"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She also has evidence of liver and renal organ damage. The patient has had two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and has required maximal ventilatory support. She is currently on several medications including cisatracurium, norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, metoprolol, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is complicated by severe ARDS, requiring maximal ventilatory support. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Shock: The patient has experienced two episodes of PEA arrest and instability with hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypertension, indicating possible shock. She responded well to epinephrine during these episodes.
3. Organ Damage: The patient has evidence of liver and renal organ damage, as indicated by rising creatinine and transaminitis.
4. Infection: The patient has a fever curve trending up, suggesting a possible ongoing infection despite antibiotic coverage.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars are running in the 600-700's despite insulin therapy, indicating poor glycemic control.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure. She has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, asthma, and multiple allergies. The patient's current condition includes fever with unknown origin, alteration in nutrition, tachycardia, constipation, ineffective coping, and respiratory failure.

The patient experienced several events during the 24-hour period, including cardiac arrest, cardiovascular/defibrillation, blood cultures drawn from both central and arterial lines, and urine culture. She also had episodes of hypotension and hypertension, which required pressor support. The patient's temperature reached 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, and she was given epinephrine during a cardiac arrest event.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102 to 161 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 18 mmHg, indicating fluid overload. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 320 mL, respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 13 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80%.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low"

   - Diuresed well
   - In the evening, shut off NO --> sats from 94 to 90, Ppeak 37,
   Pplateau 34 increased PEEP to 15. Plan was: if better, then go down on
   FiO2. If worse, back on NO --> repeat O2 slightly lower, so getting

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, now with increasing vent requirements, and evolving
   metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with
   evidence of liver and renal organ damage. Has now had 2 episodes of PEA
   and then 2 episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks.
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 2 PEA arrests days ago and a
   prolonged episode of instability yesterday of desaturation,
   hypotension, bradycardia followed by HTN and tachy x2, requiring shocks
   x2 and pressors.
   - Now that pt is a little more stable, will send to CT scan for
   head/torso to find source of infection. Take epinephrine and Levophed
   to CT scanner.
   - After CT scan, overall plan at present is to wean the NO (done) and
   to work with the PEEP and FiO2, currently at 15/80%.  Most recent gas
   is improved so we will wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue PRVC for now
   - Continue Lasix diuresis again today with goal 1L negative as
   tolerated. Start with small IV bolus AFTER CT scan.  Watch pm lytes as
   HCO3 is rising.
   - Pt currently off pressors
   - Pt continues on Cisatracurium, would continue today
   - ABx coverage currently with Levaquin (started [**10-29**]), Vanc (started
   [**10-30**]), Cefepime (started [**10-31**]).
   - Cdiff negative and gut flora as source seems less likely, Flagyl has
   been stopped.
   - Patient receiving Peramivir.  State lab results are negative for H1N1
   but we are continuing empirically
 finish 5 day course, today is day
   #5.
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities --> everything negative to date
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; stop
   solumedrol today.
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient
s situation is very tenuous and
   she decompensates precipitously in setting of hypoxia, presumably due
   to vagal vasodilation.  Responds well to epinephrine.  She does have
   evidence of end-organ damage on labs, with rising Cr and
   transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as she stabilizes to trend
   for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   # Persisent fevers/bandemia: Without any culture or clear source.
   Fever curve is up, possibly from unmasking due to stopping steroids.
   Or from unidentified source.
   - Pan-culture again today (blood, urine, c.diff).  CXR done.
   - Continues on peramivir until [**11-4**], today, and ABx as above
   - Stop steroids.
   - Tylenol scheduled
   - Now off NO with good pressures, so will go to CT scan for CT torso
   and head to evaluate for source.
   - Consider thoracentesis.
   # HyperNa: Start free H2O flushes in NGT.
   # Metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation: likely a response
   to recent hypercarbia.
   - Consider Acetazolamide
   Less active issues
   # Rising creatinine: patient has slowly rising creatinine, almost
   definitely hypoperfusion during PEA arrest.
   - FeNa yesterday was not consistent with pre-renal
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   # Hyperglycemia. On presentation, blood sugars running in the 600-700's
   despite 40U/hr insulin gtt and several 10-20U boluses. Most likely due
   to the 3L D5W with bicarb to address acidosis, but could be stress
   response to shock. More recently, they have been much better
   controlled.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   FEN: Bolus IVFs prn, replete electrolytes, will start to consider TPN

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma, who presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and subsequently developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation, and has required multiple shocks due to episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and hemodynamic instability.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.9Â°F (38.8Â°C), heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 80% FiO2. The patient's EKG shows sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including cisatracurium, midazolam, fentanyl, insulin, famotidine, furosemide, heparin, and peramivir. The patient's blood glucose levels have been high, ranging from 600-700 mg/dL, but have been better controlled recently.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, lactate, and troponin levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests, elevated BUN and creatinine levels, and low albumin level. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg,"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma, and recent presentation to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which required maximal ventilatory support. 

The patient has experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests and subsequent hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 80% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 15 cmH2O. The recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results show an improved gas exchange. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated troponin T, and evidence of liver and renal organ damage. The patient's blood glucose levels have been significantly elevated but have improved with insulin therapy. 

The patient's current medications include cisatracurium, midazolam, fentanyl, regular insulin, famotidine, lasix, heparin sodium, and peramivir. 

The patient's clinical picture suggests several potential medical complications, including respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, hypocalcemia, metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation, elevated creatinine, elevated troponins, hyperglycemia"

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, now with increasing vent requirements, and evolving
   metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with
   evidence of liver and renal organ damage. Has now had 2 episodes of PEA
   and then 2 episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks.
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 2 PEA arrests days ago and a
   prolonged episode of instability yesterday of desaturation,
   hypotension, bradycardia followed by HTN and tachy x2, requiring shocks
   x2 and pressors.
   - Overall plan at present is to wean the NO (done) and to work with the
   PEEP and FiO2, currently at 15/80%. Will f/u this am's most recent gas
   and if O2 not better, will have to consider adding back the NO, as
   there isn't much room to increase PEEP or FiO2.
   - Continue PRVC for now
   - Continue Lasix diuresis again today with goal 1L negative as
   tolerated
   - Pt currently off pressors
   - Pt continues on Cisatra, would continue today
   - ABx coverage currently with Levaquin (started [**10-29**]), Vanc (started
   [**10-30**]), Cefepime (started [**10-31**]).
   - Cdiff negative and gut flora as source seems less likely, Flagyl has
   been stopped.
   - Patient receiving Peramivir.  State lab results are negative for H1N1
   but we are continuing empirically
 finish 5 day course, today is day
   #5.
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities --> everything negative to date
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; decrease
   Solumedrol to 15 q8h
   - Diuresis with lasix 20mg IV for now; aim to get more access so can
   have lasix gtt
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient
s situation is very tenuous and
   she decompensates precipitously in setting of hypoxia, presumably due
   to vagal vasodilation.  Responds well to epinephrine.  She does have
   evidence of end-organ damage on labs, with rising Cr and
   transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as she stabilizes to trend
   for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   # Febrility: Without any culture or clear source.
   - Continues on peramivir until [**11-4**], today, and ABx as above
   - Tylenol scheduled
   - If off NO and able, to CT scan for CT torso +/- head to evaluate for
   source
   # Metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation: likely a response
   to recent hypercarbia.
   - Consider Acetazolamide
   Less active issues
   # Rising creatinine: patient has slowly rising creatinine, almost
   definitely hypoperfusion during PEA arrest.
   - FeNa yesterday was not consistent with pre-renal
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   # Hyperglycemia. On presentation, blood sugars running in the 600-700's
   despite 40U/hr insulin gtt and several 10-20U boluses. Most likely due
   to the 3L D5W with bicarb to address acidosis, but could be stress
   response to shock. More recently, they have been much better
   controlled.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   FEN: Bolus IVFs prn, replete electrolytes, will start to consider TPN
   if she is able to stay off pressors and keep the access open
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; change from H2 blocker to IV PPI
   Access: Has L art line, R IJ and 2 peripherals
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family.

   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, presenting to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain, development of hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has had two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests, requiring shocks, and a prolonged episode of instability with desaturation, hypotension, bradycardia followed by hypertension and tachycardia. The patient is currently intubated and on maximal ventilatory support. 

The patient's current plan includes weaning off nitric oxide (NO) and working with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) settings. The patient is also receiving diuretics, IV fluids, and antibiotics. The patient's family has agreed to full code status. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient presented with evidence of lobar right-sided pneumonia, progressing rapidly to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. The patient's respiratory status continues to be unstable, requiring frequent interventions.

2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has experienced two episodes of PEA arrests, indicating possible cardiac dysfunction or ischemia. The elevated troponins suggest myocardial injury, but there are no focal wall-motion abnormalities on the echo.

3. Metabolic Acidosis/Alkalosis"

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, now with increasing vent requirements, and evolving
   metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with
   evidence of liver and renal organ damage. Has now had 2 episodes of PEA
   and then 2 episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks.
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient improving this morning, taken off
   of paralysis in early AM.  In the past has become unstable ~12 hours
   after stopping paralysis, so we will monitor closely.  We were unable
   to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on ultrasound.
   For etiology, patient presented with evidence of lobar R sided
   pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal
   ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 2 PEA arrests days ago and a
   prolonged episode of instability yesterday of desaturation,
   hypotension, bradycardia followed by HTN and tachy x2, requiring shocks
   x2 and pressors.
   - After 12 hours off of paralysis, can wean off of FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated.
   - Continue PRVC for now
   - further Lasix diuresis again today with goal 1-2L negative as
   tolerated. f/u PM labs given hypernatremia
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]), Vanc (started [**10-30**]), Cefepime
   (started [**10-31**]) for severe pneumonia, plan is for a 15-day course.
   - Finished 5 day course of [**Last Name (LF) 10191**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] d/c today.
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities --> everything negative to date
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   # HyperNa: Start free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.
   - check PM lytes.
   # Metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation: likely a response
   to recent hypercarbia.
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   was difficult to control yesterday when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while starting tube feeds.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars.
   Less active issues
   # Rising creatinine: today improving slightly, we will continue to
   trend.
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   FEN: No IVFs, replete electrolytes, start tube feeds with free water
   flushes for hypernatremia.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; H2 blocker
   Access: Has L art line, R IJ and 2 peripherals
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family.
   Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 10086**] speaks English and understands the
   situation, was informed of acute decline last night. Phone numbers are
   in board in room
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possible right pneumonia. The patient has had two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. She also exhibits signs of liver and renal organ damage.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure/ARDS, fever of unknown origin, tachycardia, constipation, ineffective coping, and electrolyte & fluid disorder, among others. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with PRVC mode, FiO2 of 80%, and PEEP of 15 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST), elevated lactate levels, and low potassium levels, among other abnormalities.

The patient is being treated with multiple antibiotics for severe pneumonia, Lasix diuresis, and insulin gtt for hyperglycemia. The plan is to continue weaning off FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, continue PRVC mode for ventilation, and further Lasix diuresis with a goal of 1-2 liters negative as tolerated. The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to remain in the ICU pending clinical improvement."

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, now with increasing vent requirements, and evolving
   metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with
   evidence of liver and renal organ damage. Has now had 2 episodes of PEA
   and then 2 episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks.
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 2 PEA arrests days ago and a
   prolonged episode of instability yesterday of desaturation,
   hypotension, bradycardia followed by HTN and tachy x2, requiring shocks
   x2 and pressors.
   - Now that pt is a little more stable, will send to CT scan for
   head/torso to find source of infection. Take epinephrine and Levophed
   to CT scanner.
   - After CT scan, overall plan at present is to wean the NO (done) and
   to work with the PEEP and FiO2, currently at 15/80%.  Most recent gas
   is improved so we will wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue PRVC for now
   - Continue Lasix diuresis again today with goal 1L negative as
   tolerated. Start with small IV bolus AFTER CT scan.  Watch pm lytes as
   HCO3 is rising.
   - Pt currently off pressors
   - Pt continues on Cisatracurium, would continue today
   - ABx coverage currently with Levaquin (started [**10-29**]), Vanc (started
   [**10-30**]), Cefepime (started [**10-31**]).
   - Cdiff negative and gut flora as source seems less likely, Flagyl has
   been stopped.
   - Patient receiving Peramivir.  State lab results are negative for H1N1
   but we are continuing empirically
 finish 5 day course, today is day
   #5.
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities --> everything negative to date
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; stop
   solumedrol today.
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient
s situation is very tenuous and
   she decompensates precipitously in setting of hypoxia, presumably due
   to vagal vasodilation.  Responds well to epinephrine.  She does have
   evidence of end-organ damage on labs, with rising Cr and
   transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as she stabilizes to trend
   for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   # Persisent fevers/bandemia: Without any culture or clear source.
   Fever curve is up, possibly from unmasking due to stopping steroids.
   Or from unidentified source.
   - Pan-culture again today (blood, urine, c.diff).  CXR done.
   - Continues on peramivir until [**11-4**], today, and ABx as above
   - Stop steroids.
   - Tylenol scheduled
   - Now off NO with good pressures, so will go to CT scan for CT torso
   and head to evaluate for source.
   - Consider thoracentesis.
   # HyperNa: Start free H2O flushes in NGT.
   # Metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation: likely a response
   to recent hypercarbia.
   - Consider Acetazolamide
   Less active issues
   # Rising creatinine: patient has slowly rising creatinine, almost
   definitely hypoperfusion during PEA arrest.
   - FeNa yesterday was not consistent with pre-renal
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   # Hyperglycemia. On presentation, blood sugars running in the 600-700's
   despite 40U/hr insulin gtt and several 10-20U boluses. Most likely due
   to the 3L D5W with bicarb to address acidosis, but could be stress
   response to shock. More recently, they have been much better
   controlled.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   FEN: Bolus IVFs prn, replete electrolytes, will start to consider TPN
   if she is able to stay off pressors and keep the access open
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; change from H2 blocker to IV PPI
   Access: Has L art line, R IJ and 2 peripherals
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family.

   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is sepsis/PEA arrest. The patient has a history of difficult intubation, diabetes mellitus type I, hypertension, and asthma. 

The patient presented to the emergency department with RUQ pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible right-sided pneumonia. The patient experienced two episodes of PEA arrest and a prolonged episode of instability yesterday, requiring shocks. 

Currently, the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PRVC mode, FiO2 80%, and PEEP 15 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.6Â°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 148/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 20.7 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 80/39), increased lactate levels (1.1 mmol/L), hypoalbuminemia (2.9 g/dL), and renal impairment with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. 

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Levofloxacin, Metronidazole, Cefepime, and Vancomycin. The patient also received Peramivir for suspected H1N1"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with ARDS/PNA who is showing signs of improvement. She has been taken off paralytics and is afebrile. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, electrolyte and fluid disorders, constipation, ineffective coping, and respiratory failure. She also has an unknown origin fever. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
2. Infection: Despite being afebrile, the patient has an ongoing fever of unknown origin, which could indicate a hidden infection that needs to be identified and treated promptly.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, as indicated by her high central venous pressure (CVP) and positive fluid balance. This can lead to pulmonary edema and heart failure.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high serum sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia. This can cause neurological symptoms and dehydration.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type I diabetes mellitus, which requires careful management of blood glucose levels.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient has low calcium levels, which can result in muscle cramps, tetany, and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder that requires correction to maintain proper bodily functions.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, now with increasing vent requirements, and evolving
   metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with
   evidence of liver and renal organ damage. Has now had 2 episodes of PEA
   and then 2 episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks.
     # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient improving this morning, taken
   off of paralysis in early AM.  In the past has become unstable ~12
   hours after stopping paralysis, so we will monitor closely.  We were
   unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on
   ultrasound.  For etiology, patient presented with evidence of lobar R
   sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal
   ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 2 PEA arrests days ago and a
   prolonged episode of instability yesterday of desaturation,
   hypotension, bradycardia followed by HTN and tachy x2, requiring shocks
   x2 and pressors.
   - Wean off of FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.
   - Continue PRVC for now
   - Hold on Lasix diuresis while w/u tachycardia
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]), Vanc (started [**10-30**]), Cefepime
   (started [**10-31**]) for severe pneumonia, plan is for a 15-day course.
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Tachycardia last night and this morning that responded to
   fluid bolus of 500cc.  Could be due to blood loss as Hct is low vs
   sepsis.  Patient had Gm variable rods in a blood culture yesterday.
   - guaiac stools
   - consult GI if positive
   - blood transfusion
   - hemolytic w/u: haptoglobin, fibrinogen, tbili and ibili, smear, LDH
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
    .
   # HyperNa: Start free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.
   - continue free water flushes in Gtube.
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation: likely a response
   to recent hypercarbia. This has resolved.
   - continue to check ABG
s with change in status and vent settings.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   was difficult to control yesterday when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while starting tube feeds.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars.
   .
   Less active issues
   # Rising creatinine: today improving slightly, we will continue to
   trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   .
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   .
   FEN: No IVFs, replete electrolytes, start tube feeds with free water
   flushes for hypernatremia.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; H2 blocker
   Access: Has L art line, R IJ and 2 peripherals
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition:

- The patient is a 70-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and asthma. She presented to the emergency department (ED) with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, which progressed to hypoxic respiratory failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has a history of asthma and was admitted with evidence of lobar right-sided pneumonia, which rapidly progressed to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support.
- She experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests and required shocks, indicating hemodynamic instability.
- The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status but continues to require ventilatory support.
- Laboratory results indicate liver and renal organ damage, as well as metabolic lactic acidosis.
- Imaging studies reveal widespread parenchymal opacities and bibasal right more than left atelectasis, with bilateral pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or failure within the limitations of the chest radiograph.
- Microbiology cultures show gram-negative rods in the blood culture and yeast in the urine culture.
- The patient's current medications include IV regular insulin, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and various antibiotics for severe pneumonia.
- The patient's code status is full code, confirmed with the family.
- The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 2,"

   in board in room
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has evidence of lobar right-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. The patient experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests and hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. She has metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and organ damage to the liver and kidneys.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's condition is stable overnight, but we need to continue PRVC for now, wean off FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, and monitor for any changes in respiratory status.
2. Tachycardia: The patient had a tachycardia episode last night and this morning that responded to a fluid bolus. It could be due to blood loss or sepsis. We should continue to monitor the patient's heart rate and consider further evaluation if necessary.
3. Repeated PEA arrests/shock: The patient's repeated episodes of PEA arrests and shock may be due to vagal vasodilation in the setting of hypoxia. She responds well to epinephrine, and we should continue to check labs for improvement of end-organ damage.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia,"

   Still on high levels of PEEP with adequate oxygenation. Will try to
   reduce FIO2 today.
   Creat improving. Electrolytes acceptable. Metabolic alkalosis present,
   likely due in part to compensation for respiratory acidosis, although
   has evidence of a primary metabolic alkalosis (diuresed yesterday)
   Meropenem added today to antibiotics given positive blood culture.
   CVP 11 this AM on PEEP 15 suggesting she is intravascularly volume
   depleted. Would have postivie fluid balance today to see if that helps
   tachycardia. Start with half normal saline in light of mild
   hypernatremia.
   Reduce FIO2 nowt to 0.5. If she tolerates that well, woudl begin to
   reduce PEEP. CXR looks better with less alveolar infiltrates.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still on high levels of PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) with adequate oxygenation, indicating ongoing respiratory support. The respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Infection: The patient's blood culture growing gram ""variable"" rods suggests a bacterial infection. Antibiotics have been started, but the patient's condition indicates a possible ongoing infection.

3. Tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia last night with isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and low blood pressure. This could be a sign of cardiac dysfunction or an adverse reaction to the medications.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is mentioned as 148/86 mmHg, which is within the normal range but may still indicate some degree of hypotension considering the overall critical condition.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.

6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. These imbalances need to be closely monitored and managed to avoid complications.

7. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient"

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage. Has now had 2 episodes of PEA and then 2
   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  We were unable to find a fluid collection
   amenable to thoracentesis on ultrasound.  For etiology, patient
   presented with evidence of lobar R sided pneumonia with rapid
   progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. Pt is
   now s/p 7 PEA arrests.
   Overnight, the pt was weaned down from a PEEP 15
 14 which she
   tolerated well and gases were reasonable, but dropped O2 when taken
   down to PEEP of 13, so brought back up to PEEP 14. Also this morning
   she was getting dysynchronous with the vent.
   - Today we will do a trial of pressure support and let her breath on
   her own. Repeat ABG this afternoon.
   - Will give Lasix 40mg IV x1 today and f/u UOP later in the day. Her
   CVP is currently 17 indicating she is fluid resuscitated, if not
   overloaded a bit.
   - Get stat CXR that was not done this morning and f/u
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]
 [**2151-11-7**] = day 10), Vanc (started
   [**10-30**]
 [**2151-11-7**] = day 9), and Cefepime (started [**10-31**]
 [**2151-11-7**] = day
   8) for severe pneumonia, plan is for a 15-day course.  Meropenem
   started and cefipime stopped because positive blood cultures despite
   being on antibiotics
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.
   - Re-pan Cx today
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - ID recs holding the course for now, daily BCx
s, and consider
   changing the lines
   - Will hold off on changing lines for now, but something to keep in
   mind
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia responded several days ago to
   500cc boluses of fluids, but not so much yesterday when she got 1L
   fluids. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds.
   - Address both tachycardia and HTN by starting Labetalol 600mg PO tid
   through NGT, and IV Hydral for breakthrough HTN.
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.
    # HyperNa: Currently getting  free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds. HyperNa
   this am, will repeat Na this afternoon and if worse, would consider
   increasing the free H20 flushes in Gtube.
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars.
   #Yeast in urine: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].
   Less active issues
   # Rising creatinine: today improving slightly, we will continue to
   trend.
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She also had increasing ventilatory requirements and evolving metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis, with evidence of liver and renal organ damage. The patient has had two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and then two episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she is more stable but still requires maximal ventilatory support. The patient has persistent fevers, tachycardia, and hypertension. She also has hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient presented with evidence of lobar right-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. She continues to require close monitoring and management of her respiratory status.

2. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers of unknown origin, possibly related to right-sided pneumonia from admission. Blood cultures have shown positive results despite being on antibiotics, indicating a possible ongoing infection.

3. Tachycardia and Hypertension: The patient has persistent tachycardia and hypertension. These symptoms may be due to underlying infection, sepsis, or stress response. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly due to right-sided pneumonia. The patient has experienced multiple episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. 

The patient's current status includes respiratory failure/ARDS, fever of unknown origin, alteration in nutrition, tachycardia, ineffective coping, constipation, ineffective coping, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), diabetes mellitus type I, hypocalcemia, electrolyte & fluid disorder, and others.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure/ARDS, tachycardia, repeated PEA arrests/shock, hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation, hyperglycemia, yeast in urine, rising creatinine, elevated troponins, and history of difficult intubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis secondary to pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection, further episodes of PEA or cardiac arrest, worsening hyperglycemia, worsening renal function, and potential complications related to long-term ventilation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, ventilation, electrolyte levels, glucose levels, and daily weights. Frequent laboratory tests should be performed to assess"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, and acute renal failure. They have been febrile, with a positive blood culture that is now negative. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and insulin therapy. They have been hemodynamically stable, but experience intermittent tachycardia and hypertension. The patient's fluid balance has been positive, and they have received diuretics. A repeat chest X-ray showed focal pneumonia rather than acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's serum sodium level is elevated, and they require additional free water replacement. Their hematocrit (Hct) is trending down, but not at the transfusion threshold.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective oxygenation: The patient's respiratory failure and pneumonia may lead to inadequate oxygenation of tissues.
2. Acute kidney injury: The presence of acute renal failure suggests impaired kidney function, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, decreased urine output, and potential complications such as sepsis.
3. Sepsis: The initial positive blood culture, fever, and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible infection, which could progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
4. Electrolyte disturbances: The patient's serum sodium level is elevated, indicating a risk of hypernatremia. Additionally, the trend of decreasing Hct suggests the possibility of dilutional hyponatremia due to fluid administration.
5. Hypotension: Given the patient's positive fluid balance and current stability, there is a risk of developing hypotension if excessive fluids are administered.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications if they dislodge and travel to the lungs.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia, which can complicate the patient's existing respiratory issues.
8. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU setting can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can be difficult to manage and may lead to infection.
9. Medication complications: The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management drugs, and insulin therapy. These medications can have side effects or interactions that need to be closely monitored.
10. Delirium: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing delirium due to the stress of illness, medications, and immobility.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, kidney function, fluid balance, electrolytes, and infection parameters to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage. Has now had 2 episodes of PEA and then 2
   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
   .
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  We were unable to find a fluid collection
   amenable to thoracentesis on ultrasound.  For etiology, patient
   presented with evidence of lobar R sided pneumonia with rapid
   progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. Pt is
   now s/p 7 PEA arrests.
   .
   Overnight, the pt was weaned down from a PEEP 15
 14 which she
   tolerated well and gases were reasonable, but dropped O2 when taken
   down to PEEP of 13, so brought back up to PEEP 14. Also this morning
   she was getting dysynchronous with the vent.  Tried pressure support
   trial and patient breathing with abdomen.  Back to volume control, but
   still breathing with abdomen.
   - Will give Lasix 40mg IV x1 today and f/u UOP later in the day. Her
   CVP is currently 17 indicating she is fluid resuscitated, if not
   overloaded a bit.
   - Get stat CXR that was not done this morning and f/u
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]; on day 11), Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on
   day 9), and Cefepime (started [**10-31**]; on day 8) for severe pneumonia,
   plan is for a 15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime stopped
   because positive blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.  These
   blood cultures are now reported as negative.
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - ID recs holding the course for now, daily BCx
s, and consider
   changing the lines
   - Will hold off on changing lines for now, but something to keep in
   mind
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia responded several days ago to
   500cc boluses of fluids, but not so much yesterday when she got 1L
   fluids. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds.
   - Address both tachycardia and HTN by starting Labetalol 600mg PO tid
   through NGT, and IV Hydral for breakthrough HTN.
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.
   .
    # HyperNa: Currently getting  free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.  Normal
   blood Na this morning.
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Continue insulin gtt with insulin boluses on top
   - Q1hr blood sugars.
   #Yeast in urine: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].
   Less active issues
   # Rising creatinine: today improving slightly, we will continue to
   trend.
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   FEN: No IVFs, replete electrolytes, tube feeds with free water flushes

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Improved pulmonary edema.
   2. Stable right-sided effusion, right lower lobe pneumonia, and left
   lower
   lobe atelectasis.
   Microbiology: Blood cultures and urine culture negative for yeast
   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Has now had 2 episodes of PEA and then 2
   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  For etiology, patient presented with
   evidence of lobar R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe
   ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA
   arrests.   We were unable to find a fluid collection amenable to
   thoracentesis on ultrasound
   .
   Overnight, the pt was weaned to a PSV on 12 and 12.  She tolerated this
   well for several hours, but became HTN, desaturated and went back to
   volume control overnight.  Was weaned back to PSV 12/12 this morning.
   0
   - Will give Lasix 40mg IV x1 today and f/u UOP later in the day.
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]; on day 12), Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on
   day 10), and Cefepime (started [**10-31**]; on day 9) for severe pneumonia,
   plan is for a 15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime stopped
   because positive blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.  These
   blood cultures are now reported as negative.
   - ID recs on current abio regimen
   - F/u sputum Cx's and sensitivities
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.   Afebrile overnight.
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - ID recs holding the course for now, daily BCx
s, and consider
   changing the lines
   - Will hold off on changing lines for now, but something to keep in
   mind
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia responded several days ago to
   500cc boluses of fluids, but not so much yesterday when she got 1L
   fluids. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds.
   - Address both tachycardia and HTN by starting Labetalol 600mg PO tid
   through NGT, and IV Hydral for breakthrough HTN.
   - Was started on amlodipine 10mg
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Currently getting  free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.  Normal
   blood Na this morning.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Will keep on insulin drip for now since sugars were so hard to
   control before.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   #Yeast in urine: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  No yeast in most
   recent urine culture.
   .
   # Rising creatinine: today improving slightly, we will continue to
   trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   .
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   .
   FEN: No IVFs, replete electrolytes, tube feeds with free water flushes
   for hypernatremia.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; H2 blocker
   Access: Has L art line, R IJ and 2 peripherals
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family.
   Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 10086**] speaks English and understands the
   situation, was informed of acute decline last night. Phone numbers are
   in board in room
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement

The patient is a 70-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma who presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain, development of hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She had evidence of right-sided effusion, right lower lobe pneumonia, and left lower lobe atelectasis. The patient experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests and required shocks. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been more stable for the past few days, trying to wean down on the ventilator and control hypertension, tachycardia, and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient initially presented with severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. She has had several episodes of PEA arrests and has shown evidence of end-organ damage on labs with rising creatinine and transaminitis. There is also an ongoing issue with persistent fevers of unknown origin, possibly related to right-sided pneumonia from admission.
2. Persistent hypertension and tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia responded to fluid resuscitation, but not recently. She was on a significant home regimen of hypertension medications. She is currently being managed with IV hydralazine for breakthrough hypertension and oral labetalol through a nasogastric tube.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient takes a high dose of insulin daily at"

   1. Improved pulmonary edema.
   2. Stable right-sided effusion, right lower lobe pneumonia, and left

   Microbiology: Blood cultures and urine culture negative for yeast
   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Has now had 2 episodes of PEA and then 2
   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  For etiology, patient presented with
   evidence of lobar R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe
   ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA
   arrests.   We were unable to find a fluid collection amenable to
   thoracentesis on ultrasound
   .
   Overnight, the pt was weaned to a PSV on 12 and 12.  She tolerated this
   well for several hours, but became HTN, desaturated and went back to
   volume control overnight.  Was weaned back to PSV 12/12 this morning.
   0
   - Will give Lasix 40mg IV x1 today and f/u UOP later in the day.
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]; on day 12), Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on
   day 10), and Cefepime (started [**10-31**]; on day 9) for severe pneumonia,
   plan is for a 15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime stopped
   because positive blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.  These
   blood cultures are now reported as negative.
   - ID recs on current abio regimen
   - resend sputum because change in character of sputum
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.   Afebrile overnight.
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - ID recs holding the course for now, daily BCx
s, and consider
   changing the lines
   - Will hold off on changing lines for now, but something to keep in
   mind
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia responded several days ago to
   500cc boluses of fluids, but not so much yesterday when she got 1L
   fluids. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds.
   - Address both tachycardia and HTN by starting Labetalol 600mg PO tid
   through NGT, and IV Hydral for breakthrough HTN.
   - Was started on amlodipine 10mg
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Currently getting  free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.  Normal
   blood Na this morning.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Will keep on insulin drip for now since sugars were so hard to
   control before.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   #Yeast in urine: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  No yeast in most
   recent urine culture.
   .
   # Rising creatinine: today improving slightly, we will continue to
   trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   .
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   .
   FEN: No IVFs, replete electrolytes, tube feeds with free water flushes
   for hypernatremia.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; H2 blocker
   Access: Has L art line, R IJ and 2 peripherals. Needs bedside eval for
   PICC and go to IR for PICC if cannot at bedside.  Then d/c IJ
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family.
   Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 10086**] speaks English and understands the
   situation, was informed of acute decline last night. Phone numbers are
   in board in room

   SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:
   There is mild cardiomegaly, unchanged since the prior chest radiograph
   exam on the same day. Patient is status post PICC placement, with an
   approach from the left, and the catheter terminating at the cavoatrial
   junction. There is also a right IJ central catheter terminating within
   the mid SVC. A
   nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. An endotracheal tube
   terminates 3.6 cm above the level of the carina. There is a stable
   opacity
   within the right lower lobe, slightly increased in density in
   comparison to
   the prior chest radiograph from [**2151-11-8**] at 3 a.m. There is no
   pneumothorax. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Status post PICC placement with catheter terminating at the
   cavoatrial
   junction.
   2. Stable right lower lobe opacity is compatible with atelectasis

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Has now had 2 episodes of PEA and then 2
   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  For etiology, patient presented with
   evidence of lobar R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe
   ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA
   arrests.   We were unable to find a fluid collection amenable to
   thoracentesis on ultrasound
   Overnight, the pt was weaned to a PSV on 10 and 12.  She was tolerating
   this, but has RR in the 40's whenever her sedation was weaned.
   - Will start Lasix drip with a goal of 100cc UOP/hour
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]; on day 13), Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on
   day 12), and Cefepime/Meropenem (started [**10-31**]; on day 11) for severe
   pneumonia, plan is for a 15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime
   stopped because positive blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.
   These blood cultures are now reported as negative.   ID ok with staying
   with meropenem.
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.   Afebrile overnight.
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - Will hold off on changing lines for now, but something to keep in
   mind
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia responded several days ago to
   500cc boluses of fluids, but not so much yesterday when she got 1L
   fluids. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds.
   - Address both tachycardia and HTN by starting Labetalol 600mg PO tid
   through NGT, and IV Hydral for breakthrough HTN.
   - Was started on amlodipine 10mg
   - will diurese today and this might help with blood pressures as well.
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Currently getting  free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.  Normal
   blood Na this morning.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Change to insulin sliding scale tomorrow.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   #Yeast in urine: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast in
   urine
   - Start fluconazole 200mg IV q day
   .
   # Rising creatinine: today improving slightly, we will continue to
   trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   .
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   .
   FEN: No IVFs, replete electrolytes, tube feeds with free water flushes
   for hypernatremia.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; H2 blocker
   Access: Has L art line, R IJ and 2 peripherals. Needs bedside eval for
   PICC and go to IR for PICC if cannot at bedside.  Then d/c IJ
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family.
   Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 10086**] speaks English and understands the
   situation, was informed of acute decline last night. Phone numbers are
   in board in room
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. 

1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has evidence of lobar right-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. They have had multiple episodes of PEA arrests and are currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a stable opacity within the right lower lobe, which is compatible with atelectasis. 

2. Persistent fevers: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient still has persistent fevers. The source of the fever is unknown, possibly related to right-sided pneumonia from admission. Thoracentesis was not performed due to lack of fluid collection. 

3. Tachycardia and hypertension: The patient has persistent tachycardia and hypertension, which may be due to underlying infection, sepsis, or stress response. 

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars are difficult to control, likely due to stress and high insulin requirements. 

5. Yeast in urine: The patient has persistent yeast in the urine despite Foley catheter replacement. This indicates a possible urinary tract infection caused by yeast. 

6. Rising creatinine: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating possible kidney damage or dysfunction. 

7. Elevated Troponins: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may be due to global ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome.

   Imaging: [**2151-11-9**]
   SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:
   There is mild cardiomegaly, unchanged since the prior chest radiograph
   exam on the same day. Patient is status post PICC placement, with an
   approach from the left, and the catheter terminating at the cavoatrial
   junction. There is also a right IJ central catheter terminating within
   the mid SVC. A
   nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. An endotracheal tube
   terminates 3.6 cm above the level of the carina. There is a stable
   opacity
   within the right lower lobe, slightly increased in density in
   comparison to
   the prior chest radiograph from [**2151-11-8**] at 3 a.m. There is no
   pneumothorax. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Status post PICC placement with catheter terminating at the
   cavoatrial
   junction.
   2. Stable right lower lobe opacity is compatible with atelectasis

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Has now had 2 episodes of PEA and then 2
   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  For etiology, patient presented with
   evidence of lobar R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe
   ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA
   arrests.   We were unable to find a fluid collection amenable to
   thoracentesis on ultrasound
   .
   Overnight, the pt was weaned to a PSV on 10 and 12.  She is tolerating
   this, but has RR in the 40's whenever her sedation is weaned.
   - Will give Lasix 40mg IV x1 today and f/u UOP later in the day. Goal
   UOP should be 2 L
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]; on day 13), Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on
   day 11), and Cefepime (started [**10-31**]; on day 9) for severe pneumonia,
   plan is for a 15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime stopped
   because positive blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.  These
   blood cultures are now reported as negative.
   - ID recs on current abio regimen
   - resend sputum because change in character of sputum
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.   Afebrile overnight.
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - ID recs holding the course for now, daily BCx
s, and consider
   changing the lines
   - Will hold off on changing lines for now, but something to keep in
   mind
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia responded several days ago to
   500cc boluses of fluids, but not so much yesterday when she got 1L
   fluids. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds.
   - Address both tachycardia and HTN by starting Labetalol 600mg PO tid
   through NGT, and IV Hydral for breakthrough HTN.
   - Was started on amlodipine 10mg
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Currently getting  free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.  Normal
   blood Na this morning.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Will keep on insulin drip for now since sugars were so hard to
   control before.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   #Yeast in urine: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast in
   urine
   - Start fluconazole
   .
   # Rising creatinine: today improving slightly, we will continue to
   trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   .
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.
   .
   FEN: No IVFs, replete electrolytes, tube feeds with free water flushes
   for hypernatremia.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; H2 blocker
   Access: Has L art line, R IJ and 2 peripherals. Needs bedside eval for
   PICC and go to IR for PICC if cannot at bedside.  Then d/c IJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly due to right pneumonia. The patient has experienced multiple episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. She has been more stable recently, with efforts to wean her off the ventilator and control hypertension, tachycardia, and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's initial presentation included evidence of lobar right-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS, requiring maximal ventilatory support. There is concern for ongoing respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for continued ventilatory support and the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions on imaging.

2. Persistent Fevers: Despite ongoing antibiotic therapy, the patient continues to have fevers, possibly due to right-sided pneumonia from admission or another unknown source. No fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis was identified on ultrasound.

3. Tachycardia and Hypertension: The patient has been experiencing tachycardia and hypertension, which have been partially responsive to fluid administration and medication adjustments. The hypertension is likely related to underlying stress and infection.

4. Shock: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of PEA and hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. This suggests possible end-organ damage, and ongoing"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and allergies to ACE inhibitors and gemfibrozil. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, insulin, diuretics, and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for an elevated heart rate and slightly low blood pressure. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal with low calcium and potassium levels. She has a fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, and edema in both lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function.
3. Yeast infection: The presence of yeast in the urine suggests a possible fungal infection, which may require antifungal treatment.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium level may contribute to muscle cramps, tetany, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are"

   significantly improved but is still critically ill.  She will require a
   tracheostomy and PEG tube.  This is due to her prolonged intubation and

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Has now had 2 episodes of PEA and then 2
   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA arrests.   We were
   unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on
   ultrasound
   Overnight, the pt was weaned to PEEP of 8, so can pursue with trach
   placement. Patient looks a little dry clinically.
   - Decrease Lasix drip to goal output of 100cc/2 hours
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]; on day 14), Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on
   day 13), and Cefepime/Meropenem (started [**10-31**]; on day 12) for severe
   pneumonia, plan is for a 15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime
   stopped because positive blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.
   These blood cultures are now reported as negative.   ID ok with staying
   with meropenem.
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   - Consult IP or surgery for trach and PEG placement.
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.  IJ has been replaced,
   foley has been replaced. Patient has had blood cultures, sputum, stool,
   and urine.  Not sure what other source is possible.  Could be a drug
   fever.
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - Consider stopping any unneccessary medications.
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia has been responsive to fluid
   boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds, which were
   restarted.  Her HTN and tachyC are currently controlled.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, amlodipine 10mg, IV hydral PRN
   - continue diuresis as this will also help control blood pressure.
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Currently getting  free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.
   - Increase free water flushes
   - Free water boluses and increase lasix
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Change to insulin sliding scale today
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   #Yeast in urine: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast in
   urine
   - Continue fluconazole 200-400 qd for 5 days (day 2)
   .
   # Rising creatinine: today improving slightly, we will continue to
   trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   .
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.
   - Will need extreme care and close monitoring when extubation
   appropriate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a chief complaint of ARDS. She has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. The patient presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS. There is also a concern for right-sided pneumonia. She has had two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests and has been receiving shocks. The patient has been more stable in the past few days, trying to wean down on the ventilator and control hypertension, tachycardia, and fevers.

Active Issues:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient presented with evidence of lobar right-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. She has had seven PEA arrests. We were unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on ultrasound. The patient was weaned to PEEP of 8, so tracheostomy placement can be pursued.
2. Decrease Lasix drip to goal output of 100cc/2 hours.
3. Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]; on day 14), Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on day 13), and Cefepime/Meropenem (started [**10-31**]; on day 12) for severe pneumonia, plan is for a 15-day course. Meropenem started and cefip"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and asthma. She presented to the emergency department (ED) with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has a history of possible right pneumonia and had increasing ventilator requirements, evolving metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis, and shock. She experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and then two episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. The patient has been more stable for the past few days, attempting to wean down on the ventilator and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.

The patient's current issues include:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient presented with evidence of lobar right-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. The patient has had seven PEA arrests. Overnight, the patient was weaned to PEEP of 8, so tracheostomy placement can be pursued. The patient appears a little dry clinically.
2. Persistent fevers: The patient has persistent fevers of unknown origin, possibly related to right-sided pneumonia from admission. There is no fluid in the thorax for thoracentesis, and no source has been identified on the abdomen/pelvis CT scan done on [11-4]. The patient's central line has been replaced, and the Foley catheter has been replaced. Blood cultures, sputum, stool, and urine cultures have been obtained. It is unclear what other sources are possible, and it could be a drug fever.
3. Tachycardia and HTN: The patient's tachycardia has been responsive to fluid boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN medications, which were restarted. Her HTN and tachycardia are currently controlled.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which will be addressed by increasing free water flushes and diuresis.
5. Repeated PEA arrests/shock: The patient decompensates precipitously in the setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation. She responds well to epinephrine. The patient has evidence of end-organ damage on labs, with rising creatinine and transaminitis. Labs will continue to be monitored for improvement.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient takes a high dose of insulin daily at home, and it has been difficult to control her blood sugar while on D5W. Insulin will be continued as a gtt while the patient is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her status becomes more stable, a transition to subcutaneous insulin and a fixed dose will be considered.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). She has been showing improvement but still requires respiratory support. The patient has a fever, altered mental status, tachycardia, constipation, ineffective coping, and respiratory failure. She also has diabetes mellitus type I, hypocalcemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and anemia. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antihypertensives, insulin, and other ICU medications. She is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has arterial and peripheral intravenous lines in place. The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if she is unable to be extubated or if a tracheostomy is required. This may lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Infection: The patient's fever and ongoing use of antibiotics suggest a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or worsening infection is crucial.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance indicates fluid overload. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show some fluctuations. Hypotension can increase the risk of"

   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Has now had 2 episodes of PEA and then 2
   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA arrests.   We were
   unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on
   ultrasound  Overnight, the pt was weaned to PEEP of 5 and PS of 0.  Can
   pursue with trach placement, but would give patient extuabtion trial.
   Patient is on the schedule tentatively for Mon.  Patient looks a little
   dry clinically.
   - Lasix drip at current setting; consider decreasing amount
   - Acetazolamide [**Hospital1 **] for alkalemia
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]; on day 15), Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on
   day 14), and Cefepime/Meropenem (started [**10-31**]; on day 13) for severe
   pneumonia, plan is for a 15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime
   stopped because positive blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.
   These blood cultures are now reported as negative.   ID ok with staying
   with meropenem.
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.  IJ has been replaced,
   foley has been replaced. Patient has had blood cultures, sputum, stool,
   and urine.  Not sure what other source is possible.  Could be a drug
   fever.
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - Consider stopping any unneccessary medications.
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia has been responsive to fluid
   boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds, which were
   restarted.  Her HTN and tachyC are currently controlled.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, amlodipine 10mg, IV hydral PRN
   - Zyprexa for agitation
   - continue diuresis as this will also help control blood pressure.
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.
   #Yeast in urine: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast in
   urine
   - Continue fluconazole 200-400 qd for 5 days (day 3)
   .
   #Anemia: patient Hct has been low for length of stay and interval bllod
   transfusions given.  Patient given a unit yesteday and increased Hct 2
   points.  Cause of her low Hct is now know, but there does not seem to
   be a GI bleed per NG tube suctioning and bowel movement examination.
   Loss could be due to being critically ill.
   - Give blood transfusion as needed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Change 50 glargine to 40BID w/ sliding scale and stop drip.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Currently getting  free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.
   - Increase free water flushes
   - Free water boluses and increase lasix
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has had multiple episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been relatively stable for the past few days, with efforts to wean her down on the ventilator and control hypertension, tachycardia, and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient presented with severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. There is concern for ongoing respiratory failure, especially if the patient does not respond to tracheostomy and extubation trial.
2. Persistent fevers: Despite negative blood cultures, the patient continues to have fevers of unknown origin. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Tachycardia and hypertension: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension are currently controlled with medication, but there is a risk of recurrence if underlying causes are not addressed.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has been difficult to control on insulin, and her blood sugars have been in the high 100's to low 200's. Close monitoring and adjustment of insulin therapy will be necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's"

   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Has now had 2 episodes of PEA and then 2
   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA arrests.   We were
   unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on
   ultrasound  Overnight, the pt was weaned to PEEP of 5 and PS of 0.  Can
   pursue with trach placement, but would give patient extuabtion trial.
   Patient is on the schedule tentatively for Mon.  Patient looks a little
   dry clinically.
   - Lasix drip at current setting of 9 mg/hour, goal negative 500
   today
   - Acetazolamide [**Hospital1 **] for alkalemia
   - Discontinue Levaquin today
   - Continue Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on day 15), and Cefepime/Meropenem
   (started [**10-31**]; on day 14) for severe pneumonia, plan is for a 15-day
   course.  Meropenem started and cefipime stopped because positive blood
   cultures despite being on antibiotics.  These blood cultures are now
   reported as negative.   ID ok with staying with meropenem.
   - d/c Levaquin [**11-13**], d/c Vanc [**11-14**], d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 350**] [**11-15**]
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids
   - At first, minimal cuff leak, then on rounds, more robust leak present
   - Consider cook catheter if planning for extubation tomorrow
   - Plan for extubation tomorrow; alert anesthesia d/t difficulty of
   intubation (for this, NPO in the early morning, at least 2 hours before
   extubation)
   - Contact family regarding potential extubation planned for tomorrow
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.  IJ has been replaced,
   foley has been replaced (foley to be replaced again, d/t yeast).
   Patient has had blood cultures, sputum, stool, and urine.  Not sure
   what other source is possible.  Could be a drug fever.
   - Re-replace Foley if it wasn
t done yesterday already
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - see how fever improves when antibiotics are stopped over the next

   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia has been responsive to fluid
   boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds, which were
   restarted.  Her HTN and tachyC are currently controlled.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, amlodipine 10mg, IV hydral PRN (not needing the
   hydral prn; could consider another po prn [**Doctor Last Name **])
   - Zyprexa for agitation
   - continue diuresis as this will also help control blood pressure.
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.

   in urine.  Now yeast in vagina.

   transfusions given.  Patient given a unit yesteday and increased Hct 2
   points.  Cause of her low Hct is now know, but there does not seem to
   be a GI bleed per NG tube suctioning and bowel movement examination.
   Loss could be due to being critically ill.
   - Give blood transfusion as needed. None needed today.

   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Change 50 glargine to 40BID w/ sliding scale and stop drip.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Previously had been getting free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.
   No longer hypernatremic.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure, which progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also had evidence of possible right-sided pneumonia, liver and renal organ damage, and experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests.

Currently, the patient is more stable and is being weaned off ventilatory support. However, she still requires continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is on a lasix drip to achieve negative fluid balance. The patient's current medications include famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (Lasix), fluconazole, meropenem, and insulin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1Â°C (100.5Â°F), heart rate of 76 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 148/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 50%.

   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA arrests.   We were
   unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on
   ultrasound  Overnight, the pt was weaned to PEEP of 5 and PS of 0.  Can
   pursue with trach placement, but would give patient extuabtion trial.
   Patient is on the schedule tentatively for Mon.  Patient looks a little
   dry clinically.
   - Lasix drip at current setting; consider decreasing amount
   - Acetazolamide [**Hospital1 **] for alkalemia
   - Continue Levaquin (started [**10-29**]; on day 15), Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on
   day 14), and Cefepime/Meropenem (started [**10-31**]; on day 13) for severe
   pneumonia, plan is for a 15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime
   stopped because positive blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.
   These blood cultures are now reported as negative.   ID ok with staying
   with meropenem.
   - d/c Levaquin [**11-13**], d/c Vanc [**11-14**], d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 350**] [**11-15**]
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids.
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.  IJ has been replaced,
   foley has been replaced. Patient has had blood cultures, sputum, stool,
   and urine.  Not sure what other source is possible.  Could be a drug
   fever.
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - see how fever improves when antibiotics are stopped over the next
   couple of days.
   - reculture for BP drop or other major clinical changes.
   - Consider stopping any unneccessary medications.
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia has been responsive to fluid
   boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds, which were
   restarted.  Her HTN and tachyC are currently controlled.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, amlodipine 10mg, IV hydral PRN

   - continue diuresis as this will also help control blood pressure.
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.
   #Yeast in urine/vagina: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast
   in urine.  Now yeast in vagina.
   - Change foley today
   - Continue fluconazole 200-400 qd for 5 days (day 3)
   .
   #Anemia: patient Hct has been low for length of stay and interval blood
   transfusions given.  Patient given a unit yesteday and increased Hct 2
   points.  Cause of her low Hct is now know, but there does not seem to

   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they have a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). The patient presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and persistent fever. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.3Â°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 148/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal ventilation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 259 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 74. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and attentive mental status with normal cardiovascular findings. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, blood glucose of 156 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, chloride of 101 mEq/L, calcium of 8.7 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.2 mg/dL, and phosphate of 5.6 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate elevated troponin-T, CK, ALT, AST, and LDH levels.

Assessment and plan include altered mental status, fever of unknown origin, alteration in nutrition, tachycardia, constipation, ineffective coping, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus, hypocalcemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS and mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection, as indicated by persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count.
3. Hypotension and hypoperfusion due to low blood pressure.
4. Hypocalcemia and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Complications related to diabetes mellitus, such as poor glycemic control.
6. Potential need for tracheostomy if extubation fails.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis due to prolonged immobility.
8. Stress ulcer prophylaxis due to critical illness.
9. Possible complications from long-term mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Has now had 2 episodes of PEA and then 2
   episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring shocks. Currently, she
   has been more stable for the past several days, trying to wean down on
   the vent and control HTN, tachycardia, and fevers.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA arrests.   We were
   unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on
   ultrasound  Overnight, the pt was weaned to PEEP of 5 and PS of 0.  Can
   pursue with trach placement, but would give patient extuabtion trial.
   Patient is on the schedule tentatively for Mon.  Patient looks a little
   dry clinically.
   - Lasix drip at current setting of 9 mg/hour, goal negative 500
   today
   - Acetazolamide [**Hospital1 **] for alkalemia
   - Stop Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on day 15), and stop Cefepime/Meropenem
   (started [**10-31**]; on day 15) tomorrow for severe pneumonia, plan is for a
   15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime stopped because positive
   blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.  These blood cultures are
   now reported as negative.   ID ok with staying with meropenem.
   - d/c Levaquin [**11-13**], d/c Vanc [**11-14**], d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 350**] [**11-15**]
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids
   - At first, minimal cuff leak, then on rounds, more robust leak present
   - Consider cook catheter if planning for extubation tomorrow
   - Plan for extubation; alert anesthesia d/t difficulty of intubation
   (for this, NPO in the early morning, at least 2 hours before
   extubation)
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.  IJ has been replaced,
   foley has been replaced (foley to be replaced again, d/t yeast).
   Patient has had blood cultures, sputum, stool, and urine.  Not sure
   what other source is possible.  Could be a drug fever.
   - Re-replace Foley if it wasn
t done yesterday already
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - see how fever improves when antibiotics are stopped over the next
   couple of days.
   - reculture for BP drop or other major clinical changes.
   - Consider stopping any unneccessary medications, in case drug fever is
   causative
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia has been responsive to fluid
   boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds, which were
   restarted.  Her HTN and tachyC are currently controlled.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, amlodipine 10mg, IV hydral PRN (not needing the
   hydral prn; could consider another po prn [**Doctor Last Name **])
   - Zyprexa for agitation
   - continue diuresis as this will also help control blood pressure.
   - Continue to address underlying infectious and respiratory issues.
   .
   #Yeast in urine/vagina: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast
   in urine.  Now yeast in vagina.
   - Change foley today if wasn
t changed yesterday yet
   - Continue fluconazole 200-400 qd for 5 days (day 4)
   .
   #Anemia: patient Hct has been low for length of stay and interval blood
   transfusions given.  Patient given a unit yesteday and increased Hct 2
   points.  Cause of her low Hct is now know, but there does not seem to
   be a GI bleed per NG tube suctioning and bowel movement examination.
   Loss could be due to being critically ill.
   - Give blood transfusion as needed. None needed today.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Change 50 glargine to 40BID w/ sliding scale.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Previously had been getting free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.
   No longer hypernatremic.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above
   .

d; on
   glargine and ISS.
   .
   # Rising creatinine: improving, we will continue to trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities.
   Would likely be elevated again today given PEA arrest and recent
   shocks, so we will not keep checking Trops
   - Keep on tele, watch for dysrhythmias and keep pads on chest
   .
   # History of difficult intubation.  s/p 6 attempts in ED; required
   bronchoscopic placement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, which progressed to hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, experiencing multiple episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests, hemodynamic instability, and organ damage. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, with a recent decrease in PEEP to 5 and PS of 0. There is ongoing concern about persistent fevers, tachycardia, and hypertension. Additionally, the patient has yeast infections in her urine and vagina, anemia, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's ARDS requires maximal ventilatory support, and there is a plan to pursue tracheostomy placement. However, the patient is being considered for an extubation trial.
2. Pneumonia: The patient presented with evidence of right-sided pneumonia, which may have contributed to the development of ARDS.
3. Infection: Persistent fevers indicate an ongoing infection. Blood cultures were initially positive but are now reported as negative. The patient has been on various antibiotics, and it is planned to stop them in a few days.
4. Hypotension/Shock: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Had several episodes of PEA arrest
   requiring shocks. Currently, she has been more stable for the past
   several days, was weaned off the vent and been afebrile.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA arrests.   We were
   unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on
   ultrasound  Overnight, the pt was weaned to PEEP of 5 and PS of 0.
   Will give extuabtion trial today.  Patient is on the schedule
   tentatively for Mon for trach if fails extuabtion.
   - Lasix drip at current setting of 9 mg/hour.  Will stop drip and bolus
   with lasix 40mg this morning with goal negative 500
 1L today
   - Stop Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on day 15), and stop Cefepime/Meropenem
   (started [**10-31**]; on day 15) tomorrow for severe pneumonia, plan is for a
   15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime stopped because positive
   blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.  These blood cultures are
   now reported as negative.   ID ok with staying with meropenem.
   - d/c Levaquin [**11-13**], d/c Vanc [**11-14**], d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 350**] [**11-15**]
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids
   - Plan for extubation; alert anesthesia d/t difficulty of intubation
   (for this, NPO in the early morning, at least 2 hours before
   extubation)
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.  IJ has been replaced,
   foley has been replaced. Patient has had blood cultures, sputum, stool,
   and urine.  Not sure what other source is possible.  Could be a drug
   fever.  Will see if afebrile when all antibiotics are stopped.  Was
   afebrile overnight.
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - see how fever improves when antibiotics are stopped over the next
   couple of days.
   - reculture for BP drop or other major clinical changes.
   - Consider stopping any unneccessary medications, in case drug fever is
   causative
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia has been responsive to fluid
   boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds, which were
   restarted.  Her HTN and tachyC are currently controlled.
   - Labetalol 800 TID changed to 20mg IV PRN doses for goal systolic of
   130-150 while she cannot take pills.  Change back to PO and add back
   amlodipine 10mg when can take pills
   - Zyprexa for agitation
   - continue diuresis as this will also help control blood pressure.
   .
   #Yeast in urine/vagina: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast
   in urine.  Now yeast in vagina.
   - Continue fluconazole 200-400 qd for 5 days (day 5); can be stopped
   tomorrow.
   .
   #Anemia: patient Hct has been low for length of stay and interval blood
   transfusions given.  Patient has been responsive to blood transfusions.
     Cause of her low Hct is now know, but there does not seem to be a GI
   bleed per NG tube suctioning and bowel movement examination.  Loss
   could be due to being critically ill.
   - Give blood transfusion as needed. None needed today.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Change 50 glargine to 40BID w/ sliding scale.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Previously had been getting free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.
   No longer hypernatremic.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above .
   .
   # Rising creatinine: improving, we will continue to trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities. Has
   stabilized with her improvement.

   morning as preparation for potential extubation).

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly due to right-sided pneumonia. She has had multiple episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and required multiple shocks. She is currently more stable and has been weaned off the ventilator, but is still dependent on oxygen supplementation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient presented with evidence of lobar right-sided pneumonia, which rapidly progressed to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. There is a possibility of recurring respiratory failure if extubation fails.

2. Persistent fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, possibly due to right-sided pneumonia from admission. Despite numerous tests and antibiotic therapy, the source of fever remains unknown. It could be a drug fever or another undiagnosed infection.

3. Tachycardia and hypertension: The patient has been experiencing tachycardia and hypertension, which have been responsive to fluid boluses and medication adjustments. These conditions need to be monitored and controlled.

4. Yeast in urine/vagina: The patient has yeast in both her urine and vagina, despite replacement of the Foley catheter. She is currently being treated with fluconazole, but the infection persists.

5. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit (Hct) level, indicating an"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Had several episodes of PEA arrest
   requiring shocks. Currently, she has been more stable for the past
   several days, was weaned off the vent and been afebrile.
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA arrests.   We were
   unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on
   ultrasound  Yesterday we extubated patient, doing well.
   - Continue lasix boluses to keep pt in negative fluid balance
   - Stop Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on day 15), and stop Cefepime/Meropenem
   (started [**10-31**]; on day 15) tomorrow for severe pneumonia, plan is for a
   15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime stopped because positive
   blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.  These blood cultures are
   now reported as negative.   ID ok with staying with meropenem.
   - d/c Levaquin [**11-13**], d/c Vanc [**11-14**], d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 350**] [**11-15**]
   - Asthma management with IV solumedrol and albuterol MDIs; off of
   systemic steroids
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.  IJ has been replaced,
   foley has been replaced. Patient has had blood cultures, sputum, stool,
   and urine.  Not sure what other source is possible.  Could be a drug
   fever.  Will see if afebrile when all antibiotics are stopped.  Was
   afebrile overnight.
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - see how fever improves when antibiotics are stopped over the next
   couple of days.
   - reculture for BP drop or other major clinical changes.
   - Consider stopping any unneccessary medications, in case drug fever is
   causative
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia has been responsive to fluid
   boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds, which were
   restarted.  Her HTN and tachyC are currently controlled.
   - Labetalol 800 TID changed to 20mg IV PRN doses for goal systolic of
   130-150 while she cannot take pills.  Change back to PO and add back
   amlodipine 10mg when can take pills
   - Zyprexa for agitation
   - continue diuresis as this will also help control blood pressure.
   .
   #Yeast in urine/vagina: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast
   in urine.  Now yeast in vagina.
   - Continue fluconazole 200-400 qd for 5 days (day 5); can be stopped
   tomorrow.
   .
   #Anemia: patient Hct has been low for length of stay and interval blood
   transfusions given.  Patient has been responsive to blood
   transfusions.   Cause of her low Hct is now know, but there does not
   seem to be a GI bleed per NG tube suctioning and bowel movement
   examination.  Loss could be due to being critically ill.
   - Give blood transfusion as needed. None needed today.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.  We will continue the
   insulin gtt today while she is on tube feeds. Eventually, when her
   status becomes more stable, would want to think about transitioning her
   to SSI and fixed dose, but for now keep on gtt.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Change 50 glargine to 40BID w/ sliding scale.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Previously had been getting free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.
   No longer hypernatremic.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above .
   .
   # Rising creatinine: improving, we will continue to trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities. Has
   stabilized with her improvement.
   FEN: No IVFs, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (d/c tubefeeds early
   morning as preparation for potential extubation).
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; H2 blocker
   Access: Has PICC, arterial, and 2 peripherals.
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family. Okay with trach and PEG if
   necessary.
   Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 10086**] speaks English and understands the
   situation, has been kept informed. Phone numbers are on board in room.
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement
","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 70-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and asthma.
- She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient had increasing ventilatory requirements, evolving metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis, and shock.
- She also had episodes of Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) arrest requiring defibrillation shocks.
- The patient was intubated and placed on maximal ventilatory support.
- She received several blood transfusions due to low hemoglobin levels.
- The patient was given various medications including IV solumedrol, albuterol MDIs, labetalol, and fluconazole.
- She was extubated successfully and is currently doing well.
- The patient's active issues include respiratory failure/ARDS, persistent fevers of unknown origin, tachycardia, and hypertension.
- Her less active/stable issues include hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, repeated PEA arrests/shock, rising creatinine levels, and elevated troponins.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's current condition of ARDS puts her at risk for further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Persistent Fevers: Despite multiple investigations, the source of the patient's persistent fevers remains unknown. This could indicate"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Had several episodes of PEA arrest
   requiring shocks. Currently, she has been more stable for the past
   several days, was weaned off the vent and been afebrile x 3 days (Tm
   101.5 [**2151-11-11**]).
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA arrests.   We were
   unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on
   ultrasound.  Yesterday we extubated patient, doing well.
   - Continue lasix boluses to keep pt in negative fluid balance
   - Stop Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on day 15), and stop Cefepime/Meropenem
   (started [**10-31**]; on day 15) today for severe pneumonia, as will have
   completed 15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime stopped
   because positive blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.  These
   blood cultures are now reported as negative.   ID ok with staying with
   meropenem.
   - d/c Levaquin [**11-13**], d/c Vanc [**11-14**], d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 350**] [**11-15**]
   - Asthma management with albuterol MDIs; off of systemic steroids.
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.  IJ has been replaced,
   foley has been replaced. Patient has had blood cultures, sputum, stool,
   and urine.  Not sure what other source is possible.  Could be a drug
   fever.  Will see if afebrile when all antibiotics are stopped.
   Afebrile x 3 days
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - see how fever improves when antibiotics are stopped over the next
   couple of days.
   - reculture for BP drop or other major clinical changes.
   - Consider stopping any unnecessary medications, in case drug fever is
   causative
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia has been responsive to fluid
   boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds, which were
   restarted.  Her HTN and tachyC are currently controlled.
   - Now taking Labetalol 800 TID and  amlodipine 10mg, as pt is
   tolerating POs.
   - Zyprexa for agitation
   - continue diuresis as this will also help control blood pressure.
   .
   #Yeast in urine/vagina: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast
   in urine.  Now yeast in vagina.
   - last dose of fluconazole 200 IV qd today (day [**4-13**]); can be
   discontinued tomorrow.
   .
   #Anemia: patient Hct has been low for length of stay and interval blood
   transfusions given.  Patient has been responsive to blood
   transfusions.   Cause of her low Hct is now known, but there does not
   seem to be a GI bleed per NG tube suctioning and bowel movement
   examination.  Loss could be due to being critically ill.
   - Give blood transfusion as needed. None needed today.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Change 50 glargine to 40BID w/ sliding scale
 with CBGs in mid-150s.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Previously had been getting free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.
   No longer hypernatremic.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above .
   .
   # Rising creatinine: improving, we will continue to trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities. Has
   stabilized with her improvement.
   FEN: No IVFs, replete electrolytes, tube feeds, advanced diet to soft
   mechanical diet.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; H2 blocker. PT consult.
   Access: Has PICC, arterial lines.
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family. Okay with trach and PEG if
   necessary.
   Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 10086**] speaks English and understands the
   situation, has been kept informed. Phone numbers are on board in room.
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement, ICU for now
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possible right-sided pneumonia. The patient had increasing ventilator requirements, evolving metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis, and shock, with evidence of liver and renal organ damage. She also experienced several episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest requiring defibrillation.

The patient's current condition is more stable, having been weaned off the ventilator and afebrile for three days. Active issues include respiratory failure/ARDS, persistent fevers of unknown origin, tachycardia, and hypertension. Less active/stable issues include hyperglycemia, anemia, hypernatremia, repeated PEA arrests/shock, rising creatinine, and elevated troponins.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: Continue lasix boluses to keep the patient in negative fluid balance.
2. Persistent fevers: Evaluate potential sources such as right-sided pneumonia, drug fever, or unknown origin. Follow up with cultures and consider stopping unnecessary medications.
3. Tachycardia and HTN: Restart home regimen of HTN medications and continue diuresis.
4. Yeast in urine/vagina: Foley catheter replaced, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of hypoxemic respiratory failure and multiple episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She has been extubated since yesterday and is currently doing well. The patient has completed courses of antibiotics and antifungal medication. She is still experiencing low-grade fever, agitation, and has yeast growing in her urine and sputum. The patient's condition requires intensive care unit (ICU) care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is a critical concern. Extubation was successful, but close monitoring is required to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
2. PEA Arrest: The patient has had multiple episodes of PEA arrest, indicating a potential underlying cardiac issue. Continuous cardiac monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent further episodes.
3. Infection: The presence of yeast in the urine and sputum suggests a possible fungal infection. The patient has completed antifungal treatment, but ongoing surveillance for infection and prompt management of any new infections are essential.
4. Agitation: The patient's agitation may be due to various factors such as delirium, pain, or medication side effects. Close observation and appropriate pharmacological interventions are needed to manage agitation and ensure patient safety.
5. Fever: The patient's persistent low-grade fever may indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying condition. Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly low calcium and potassium, need to be monitored and managed to avoid complications related to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other systemic issues.
7. Glycemic Control: Given the patient's critical condition and potential diabetes mellitus, tight glycemic control is crucial to prevent both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia-related complications.
8. Nutrition: The patient may require nutritional support to optimize her recovery and maintain adequate nutritional status.
9. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for DVT prophylaxis due to her prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
10. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving a stress ulcer prophylaxis with a histamine-2 receptor antagonist to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
11. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and appropriate infection control measures are necessary to prevent and manage this complication."

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
   development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
   pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic
   lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of
   liver and renal organ damage.  Had several episodes of PEA arrest
   requiring shocks. Currently, she has been more stable for the past
   several days, was weaned off the vent and been afebrile x 3 days (Tm
   101.5 [**2151-11-11**]).
   .
   ACTIVE ISSUES:
    # Respiratory failure/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar
   R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring
   maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s/p 7 PEA arrests.   We were
   unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on
   ultrasound.  Yesterday we extubated patient, doing well.
   - Continue lasix boluses to keep pt in negative fluid balance
   - Stop Vanc (started [**10-30**]; on day 15), and stop Cefepime/Meropenem
   (started [**10-31**]; on day 15) today for severe pneumonia, as will have
   completed 15-day course.  Meropenem started and cefipime stopped
   because positive blood cultures despite being on antibiotics.  These
   blood cultures are now reported as negative.   ID ok with staying with
   meropenem.
   - d/c Levaquin [**11-13**], d/c Vanc [**11-14**], d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 350**] [**11-15**]
   - Asthma management with albuterol MDIs; off of systemic steroids.
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from
   admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on
   abd/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.  IJ has been replaced,
   foley has been replaced. Patient has had blood cultures, sputum, stool,
   and urine.  Not sure what other source is possible.  Could be a drug
   fever.  Will see if afebrile when all antibiotics are stopped.
   Afebrile x 3 days
   - F/u Cx
s already drawn
   - ABx as above
   - see how fever improves when antibiotics are stopped over the next
   couple of days.
   - reculture for BP drop or other major clinical changes.
   - Consider stopping any unnecessary medications, in case drug fever is
   causative
   .
   #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia has been responsive to fluid
   boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds, which were
   restarted.  Her HTN and tachyC are currently controlled.
   - Now taking Labetalol 800 TID and  amlodipine 10mg, as pt is
   tolerating POs.
   - Zyprexa for agitation
   - continue diuresis as this will also help control blood pressure.
   .
   #Yeast in urine/vagina: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast
   in urine.  Now yeast in vagina.
   - last dose of fluconazole 200 IV qd today (day [**4-13**]); can be
   discontinued tomorrow.
   .
   #Anemia: patient Hct has been low for length of stay and interval blood
   transfusions given.  Patient has been responsive to blood
   transfusions.   Cause of her low Hct is now known, but there does not
   seem to be a GI bleed per NG tube suctioning and bowel movement
   examination.  Loss could be due to being critically ill.
   - Give blood transfusion as needed. None needed today.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and
   has been difficult to control when on D5W.
   - Will allow blood sugars in the high 100's to low 200's for now
   - Change 50 glargine to 40BID w/ sliding scale
 with CBGs in mid-150s.
   - Q2hr blood sugars.
   .
   LESS ACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES:
   # HyperNa: Previously had been getting free H2O flushes w/ tube feeds.
   No longer hypernatremic.
   .
   # Repeated PEA arrests/shock: Patient decompensates precipitously in
   setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds
   well to epinephrine.  She does have evidence of end-organ damage on
   labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis.  Will continue to check labs as
   she stabilizes to trend for improvement.
   - Have spoken to family and she is full code
   - Optimize respiratory status as above .
   .
   # Rising creatinine: improving, we will continue to trend.
   .
   # Elevated Troponins
 Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather
   than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple
   organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities. Has
   stabilized with her improvement.
   .
   FEN: No IVFs, replete electrolytes, tube feeds, advanced diet to soft
   mechanical diet.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; H2 blocker. PT consult.
   Access: Has PICC, arterial lines.
   Code:  Full code, confirmed with family. Okay with trach and PEG if
   necessary.
   Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 10086**] speaks English and understands the
   situation, has been kept informed. Phone numbers are on board in room.
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement, ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and asthma. She presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and developed hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has evidence of possible right-sided pneumonia, liver and renal organ damage, and has had several episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest requiring defibrillation.

Current issues:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient presented with severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. She was recently extubated and is doing well.
2. Persistent fevers: The patient has had ongoing fevers of unknown origin, possibly due to right-sided pneumonia from admission. No fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis was found on ultrasound.
3. Yeast in urine/vagina: Despite replacing the Foley catheter, yeast remains present in the urine. It has now also been detected in the vagina.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been low for the length of stay, and blood transfusions have been given. The cause of her low Hct is not yet known but does not seem to be a gastrointestinal bleed.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient requires a significant amount of insulin daily at home, and her blood sugar levels have been difficult to control while on D5W. Blood sugar levels in the high 100"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma who presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She had increasing ventilatory requirements, evolving metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis, and shock. The patient experienced multiple episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests requiring defibrillation. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been more stable over the past few days, weaned off the ventilator, and has been afebrile for three days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient presented with evidence of lobar right-sided pneumonia, which rapidly progressed to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support.
2. Persistent Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers, possibly due to right-sided pneumonia from admission. Fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis was not found on ultrasound, and no other source of infection has been identified. Blood cultures, sputum, stool, and urine have been drawn.
3. Tachycardia and HTN: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension are currently controlled with fluid boluses and antihypertensive medications.
4. Yeast in Urine/Vagina: The patient has yeast present in her urine and vagina. She received fluconazole IV qd, which will be discontinued tomorrow.
5. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit (Hct) level for the length of her stay, and blood transfusions have been given. The cause of her low Hct is not yet known, but there does not seem to be a gastrointestinal bleed.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient takes a high dose of insulin daily at home, and her blood sugar levels have been difficult to control on D5W. Her blood sugars are in the high 100's to low 200's, and she will be allowed to have these levels for now.
7. HyperNa: The patient has high sodium levels due to free water flushes with tube feeds. An IV fluid bolus will be given today.
8. Repeated PEA Arrests/Shock: The patient decompensates precipitously in the setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation. She responds well to epinephrine. There is evidence of end-organ damage on labs, with rising creatinine and transaminitis. Will continue to check labs for improvement.
9. Rising Creatinine: The patient's creatinine levels are improving, and we will continue to trend them.
10. Elevated Troponins: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, but almost definitely due to global ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS). There are no focal wall-motion abnormalities on echo, and she has stabilized with improvement.

Please note that the patient's medical history, medications, and test results are available in the provided progress note."
