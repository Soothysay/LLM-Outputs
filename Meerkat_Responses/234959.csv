   Assessment and Plan
   The patinet is an 86 year old male with a history of CAD, CAF (not on
   coumadin secondary to GI bleed,) dementia, bipolar disorder, and COPD
   who presented with profound anemia, found to have a large duodenal
   ulcer, and continued hematocrit drop despite epinephrine injections,
   now transfered for potential GDA embolization.
   .
   # GIB:  Patient has continued to demonstrate a unstable hematocrit
   despite EGD injections of a large duodenal ulcer.  Abdominal exam shows
   no evidence of peritonitis, and no evidence of free air under the
   diagphram on CXR.  Given the size of the duodenal ulcer with ongoing
   bleeding, treatment plans could include a GDA embolization, repeat EGD,
   or surgical intervention.  See little value in repeat EGD given the
   size of the ulcer that did not responed to epinepherin injections.
   Given patients multiple comorbidities, the risk of surgery clearly
   present, and agree that GDA embolization may be better intial
   approach.  Report for [**Hospital1 632**] described posterior perforation, which may
   explain leukocytosis, but no evidence of this in transfer records.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including CAD, CAF, dementia, bipolar disorder, and COPD. The patient presented with profound anemia and a large duodenal ulcer, resulting in ongoing bleeding despite epinephrine injections. The patient has been transferred for potential GDA embolization due to the unstable hematocrit levels.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with an unstable hematocrit despite EGD injections of a large duodenal ulcer. There is no evidence of peritonitis or free air under the diaphragm on CXR. Given the size of the duodenal ulcer with ongoing bleeding, treatment options include GDA embolization, repeat EGD, or surgical intervention.

The patient also has chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) which is well rate-controlled, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypokalemia, leukocytosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The leukocytosis may be related to a possible posterior perforation of the duodenal ulcer.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) and the following holds: amlodipine, ASA, Plavix, digoxin, and anticoagulation.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 180/81 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory"

   # GIB:  Patient has continued to demonstrate a unstable hematocrit
   despite EGD injections of a large duodenal ulcer.  Abdominal exam shows
   no evidence of peritonitis, and no evidence of free air under the
   diagphram on CXR.  Given the size of the duodenal ulcer with ongoing
   bleeding, treatment plans could include a GDA embolization, repeat EGD,
   or surgical intervention.  See little value in repeat EGD given the
   size of the ulcer that did not responed to epinepherin injections.
   Given patients multiple comorbidities, the risk of surgery clearly

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CAD, CAF, dementia, bipolar disorder, and COPD. He presented with profound anemia and a large duodenal ulcer. Despite epinephrine injections, the patient's hematocrit continued to drop, indicating ongoing bleeding. The patient is currently in the ICU for potential GDA embolization due to the large size of the duodenal ulcer and ongoing bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has an unstable hematocrit despite EGD injections for a large duodenal ulcer. This indicates a risk of continued bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and potential organ failure.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may suggest an infection or inflammation. It could be a sign of a secondary infection related to the gastrointestinal bleed or another underlying condition.
3. Chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF): The patient has a history of CAF, which is currently well-controlled with medications. However, there is a risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke or systemic embolism, if anticoagulation is not maintained.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated in the past, but currently, it is not hypertensive. Monitoring blood pressure is important to avoid complications like left ventricular hypertrophy or end-organ damage"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and potential complications that need to be considered:

1. GI bleed: The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding attributed to a duodenal ulcer. They have required a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are being monitored, and they are currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) for acid suppression. There is ongoing discussion regarding the best course of therapy, including the possibility of arteriography and embolization by the interventional radiology (IR) service.

2. COPD: The patient has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with symptoms including a productive cough. It is unclear if the symptoms are worsening. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count (WBC), which could be due to stress or early infection. Cultures have been obtained, and there is a low threshold for empirical antimicrobials.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation (A-FIB) with a controlled heart rate. The heart rate should be monitored.

5. Hypertension: The patient has elevated blood pressure, likely due to being nil per os (NPO) of usual anti-hypertensive medications. Fluid balance should be monitored.

6. Fluid repletion:"

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 13.8, hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, sodium level of 139 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and glucose level of 94 mg/dL. Other lab values include a platelet count of 197, creatinine level of 1.2, PT/PTT/INR levels of 12.3/25.8/1.0, amylase/lipase levels of 107/60, calcium level of 7.7 mg/dL, magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 3.5 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of multiple lines and tubes, as well as their compromised immune system.

2. Bleeding: The patient's elevated PT/PTT/INR levels indicate an increased risk of bleeding. This can be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulant medications or procedures.

3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant input-output discrepancy, which may indicate fluid overload or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, suggesting potential kidney dysfunction. This can be further assessed through additional renal function tests.

5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, are outside the normal range. Close monitoring and correction of these imbalances are necessary.

6. Blood product transfusion reaction: The patient has received blood products, and there is a risk of transfusion reactions such as allergic reactions, febrile non-hemolytic reactions, or even acute hemolytic reactions.

7. Gastrointestinal bleeding"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), dementia, bipolar disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with profound anemia and a large duodenal ulcer, leading to ongoing bleeding. 

The patient's current condition is unstable, with fluctuations in hematocrit levels despite epinephrine injections. There is no evidence of peritonitis or free air under the diaphragm on chest X-ray. Treatment options being considered include gastrointestinal duodenal artery (GDA) embolization, repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), or surgical intervention. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities, and the risks of surgery are evident. It is agreed that GDA embolization may be a better initial approach. The patient is already receiving IV pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitor) and will have a large bore IV. Follow-up is planned for H. pylori testing and biopsy. Consultations have been ordered from gastroenterology (GI), interventional radiology (IR), and general surgery.

Other assessments and plans include chronic atrial fibrillation, well rate-controlled, with continued use of lopressor and holding of digoxin and anticoagulation. Hypertension is not currently present, and the patient is holding amlodipine. Coronary artery disease"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CAD, CAF, dementia, bipolar disorder, and COPD. He presented with profound anemia and a large duodenal ulcer, leading to ongoing bleeding despite epinephrine injections. The patient's hematocrit levels are unstable, and there is concern for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Treatment options include GDA embolization, repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), or surgical intervention. The patient's comorbidities increase the risk of surgery, and it may be better to initially approach with GDA embolization. The patient is also being evaluated for chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), hyperkalemia (CKI), leukocytosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a large duodenal ulcer with ongoing bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
2. Hypotension: The patient's unstable hematocrit levels indicate ongoing bleeding, which can cause hypotension and shock.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, such as Clostridium difficile or a secondary infection due to the gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function should be monitored closely due to the use"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), dementia, bipolar disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with profound anemia and was found to have a large duodenal ulcer. Despite epinephrine injections, the patient continued to show an unstable hematocrit level.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a large duodenal ulcer with ongoing bleeding, which is a significant concern for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Perforation: There is a concern for posterior perforation of the duodenal ulcer, which may lead to peritonitis and sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (hypotension) may result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Due to dehydration and ongoing bleeding, there is a risk of AKI, especially considering the patient's pre-existing renal insufficiency.
5. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis suggests an underlying infection, which needs to be investigated and managed promptly.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has left upper extremity edema, raising concerns for possible DVT, especially considering the patient's immobilization and use of central venous lines.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient's history is unable to be obtained due to encephalopathy. The patient has been experiencing ""sundowning,"" which refers to increased confusion or restlessness in the evening. There is no requirement for packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion. The patient's allergies include acetylcysteine, with an unknown last dose of antibiotics.

The patient is currently on several medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix) at a rate of 8 mg/hour. Other ICU medications and changes to medical and family history are unchanged from admission except for the mentioned above.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cough and anemia. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and has been placed on nutritional support. Fluid balance shows a total in of 1,706 mL and a total out of 1,235 mL, resulting in a balance of 471 mL. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/60 mmHg to 138/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is not well-nourished and"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo M with a history of CAD, CAF (not on warfarin secondary to GI
   bleed), dementia, bipolar disorder, and COPD who presented with
   profound anemia, found to have a large duodenal ulcer, and continued
   hematocrit drop despite epinephrine injections, now transferred for
   potential GDA embolization.
   .
   # GIB:  Patient has continued to demonstrate a unstable hematocrit
   despite EGD injections of a large duodenal ulcer.  Abdominal exam shows
   no evidence of peritonitis, and no evidence of free air under the
   diaphragm on CXR.  Given the reputed size of the duodenal ulcer with
   ongoing bleeding, treatment plans could include a GDA embolization,
   repeat EGD, or surgical intervention.  See little value in repeat EGD
   given the size of the ulcer that did not responed to epinephrine
   injections.  Given patients multiple comorbidities, the risk of surgery
   clearly present, and agree that GDA embolization may be better initial
   approach.  Report for [**Hospital1 632**] described posterior perforation, which may
   explain leukocytosis, but no evidence of this in transfer records.
   - surgery defers management to IR in the event of acute bleed and,
   before that, medical management.
   - converted to PPI [**Hospital1 **] IV
   - trend hct [**Hospital1 **], increasing frequency if bloody stool or increased
   stool frequency
   - has a large bore IV
   - f/u H. pylori serologies in-house (OSH labs had no H. pylori tests
   when Path & Chem labs were called)
   - consult GI, IR, and gen surgery
 IR embo in the event that surgery
   defers management. The outcomes are likely the same.
   - continue trend hct, if not improve, will likely get abd CT for
   reeval.
   - going to be called out today
   .
   # Chronic AF: Currently well rate controlled, with bradycardic episodes
   to the low 40
   - decrease metoprolol to 12.5 TID
   - cont to hold digoxin
   - hold anticoagulation.

   # Hypertension: on amlodipine, trend

   # LUE edema
 New this AM.  Patient does have a history of L-sided IV.
   Appears to be infiltrated without evidence of edema across all
   compartments.
   - no U/S at this time; would avoid anticoagulation even if there was
   evidence of clot

   # CAD:  Not currently complaining of chest pain and no evidence of
   ACS.
   - hold ASA and plavix
   - cont BB

   #CKI:  Currently at baseline, renally dose medications and avoid
   nephrotoxins. If get CT w/ contrast, will give mucomyst/NaHCO3.

   x 2 will hold further vancomycin.  Concern for posterior performation
   in the setting of duodenal ulcer.
   - check UA and UCx

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7709**]
s note above and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname **] is a delightful
   86 yo man with a large DU that
s bled significantly. Though initially
   transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for possibly surgery or other IR intervention, so
   far he
s done well with just high dose PPI.  Today he
s comfortable and
   hemodynamically stable, if a bit bradycardic on his current dose of
   metoprolol for Afib rate control. His Hct is generally stable at 30.
   If Hct stays stable he can go to floor on a lower dose of Metoprolol.
   If there is evidence of rebleed, then IR will be re-consulted for
   embolization.  35 min spent in the care of this patient.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), dementia, bipolar disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with profound anemia and a large duodenal ulcer, resulting in continued hematocrit drop despite epinephrine injections. The patient was transferred for potential gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) embolization.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. GIB: The patient has an unstable hematocrit despite epinephrine injections for a large duodenal ulcer. There is no evidence of peritonitis or free air under the diaphragm on chest X-ray. The treatment plan includes GDA embolization, repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), or surgical intervention. The attending physician agrees with the plan to proceed with GDA embolization due to the size of the ulcer and multiple comorbidities.

2. Chronic AF: The patient's atrial fibrillation is well rate-controlled, but there are bradycardic episodes. The plan is to decrease metoprolol to 12.5 TID and hold digoxin.

3. Hypertension: The patient is on amlodipine, and the trend is stable.

4. Left upper extremity (LUE) edema: The patient has a history of left-sided IV"

- The patient was transferred for potential gastroudodenal artery (GDA) embolization due to the large size of the duodenal ulcer and ongoing bleeding.
- The patient's abdominal exam showed no evidence of peritonitis or free air under the diaphragm on chest X-ray.
- Treatment plans include GDA embolization, repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), or surgical intervention.
- The patient's multiple comorbidities and the risk of surgery suggest that GDA embolization may be a better initial approach.
- The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is restarting amlodipine for hypertension.
- The patient has left upper extremity (LUE) edema, which appears to be infiltrated without evidence of edema across all compartments.
- No ultrasound (U/S) is performed at this time to avoid anticoagulation even if there was evidence of clot.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), dementia, bipolar disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with profound anemia and a large duodenal ulcer, which has continued to bleed despite epinephrine injections. The patient's hematocrit levels are unstable, and there is a concern for ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. The treatment plan includes potential gastrointestinal bleeding embolization, repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), or surgical intervention. The patient's other medical conditions include chronic AF with bradycardic episodes, hypertension, left upper extremity edema, leukocytosis, and bipolar disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's unstable hematocrit levels indicate continued bleeding from the duodenal ulcer. This could lead to hypovolemic shock if not addressed promptly.
2. Perforation: There is a concern for posterior perforation of the duodenal ulcer, which can lead to peritonitis and sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and advanced age put him at risk for developing DVT.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is in the ICU, he is at risk for developing VAP due to mechanical ventilation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low"
