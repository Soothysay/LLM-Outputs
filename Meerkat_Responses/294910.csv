   failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following
   trasfusions at [**Hospital1 358**].
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - for now, goal Vt 6cc/kg PWB/breath
   - get formal mechanics -- PIPs suggest good compliance at present
   - differential includes [**Doctor Last Name 11**], TRALI, pneumonia (less likely), and
   leukostasis
   - TRALI and acute diastolic CHF are probably most likely
   - check mechanics, plateau, etc.  Consider RSBI and SBT if reasonable.
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   - heme/onc consult appreciated
   - no acute therapy indicated at this time
 SHOCK
   - cover empirically for pneumonia
   - goal-directed therapy, with CVP goal ~12 today
 FEVER
   - follow cultures
   - if further LFT elevation, RUQ ultrasound
 NSTEMI
   - most likely related to demand or leukostasis

   FAMILY MEETING
   [**2107-3-30**] 5p
   Met with Mr. [**Name (NI) 375**]
 wife and children to discuss his course and
   illness.  He remains critically ill, on ventilatory support and
   vasopressors.  In addition to his acute illness, he also has a very
   limited oncologic prognosis.  His wife and children indicate that he
   would not want prolonged life support, and they request DNR status in
   the case of a pulseless arrest.  We will proceed otherwise with
   aggressive care, and re-evaluate in a few days time about whether he is
   improving or not.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old man with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presenting with shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following transfusions at another hospital. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a goal to maintain a tidal volume of 6cc/kg with pressure-controlled ventilation. The differential diagnosis includes diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), pneumonia, and leukostasis.

2. Leukemia, Acute (AML): The patient has secondary AML. A heme/onc consult is appreciated, and no acute therapy is indicated at this time.

3. Shock: The patient is in shock, and goal-directed therapy with central venous pressure (CVP) goal of around 12 is being managed. Empirical coverage for pneumonia is being given, and hemodynamic management is ongoing.

4. Fever: The patient has a fever, and cultures are being followed. If further liver function test (LFT) elevation occurs, a right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound may be performed.

5. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient may have NSTEMI, which is most likely related to demand or leukostasis. An echocardiogram (echo)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 72-year-old man with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presents with shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome.
- The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and shock.
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments including rasburicase, ventilatory support, and fluid management.
- The patient has a fever, and cultures have been obtained to identify the cause.
- The patient's blood pressure is low, and hemodynamic monitoring is ongoing.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lactic acid levels, along with decreased platelet count and renal function.
- The patient's fluid analysis reveals 53% blasts in the peripheral smear.
- The patient's condition is critical, and he is on full code status.
- The patient's disposition is ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to various causes such as diffuse alveolar damage, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), pneumonia, or leukostasis. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary, and consideration should be given to performing a respiratory mechanics analysis and spontaneous breathing trial if appropriate.

   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name **]
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is experiencing respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury), tumor lysis syndrome, septic shock, CHF (congestive heart failure), TACO (trauma-associated coagulopathy), ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and leukostasis.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 123 bpm, and slightly low blood pressure at 108/51 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is within normal range at 98%. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 6 mL and output of 630 mL, indicating positive fluid balance.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 430 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The plateau pressure is 17 cmH2O, indicating mild lung compliance. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure (CHF), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, or leukostasis. Imaging results do not support the diagnosis of ARDS. The patient has been tolerating pressure support well and may be considered for extubation if they continue to improve.

The patient has been empirically covered with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and levofloxacin since day 3 for possible pneumonia or sepsis. Other potential diagnoses to consider include pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiogenic shock with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or septic shock due to possible sepsis secondary to the AML.

Additionally, the patient has renal failure, which is likely uric acid nephropathy, and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS should be managed with uricase inhibitors and close monitoring of uric acid levels. The patient also has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with elevated markers but no schistocytes on smear. There is a mild transaminitis, possibly due to tumor infiltration of the liver with hepatomegaly.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with insulin infusion, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis ("

   Disposition:should be extubated today
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is now presenting with Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI), tumor lysis syndrome, or septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure and is receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) with low tidal volume (TV) ventilation strategy. The differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure (CHF), trauma-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (TACO), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), TRALI, leukostasis, cardiogenic shock, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), septic shock, tumor lysis syndrome, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and elevated liver enzymes (LFTs).

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftazidime, and levofloxacin for suspected sepsis. He is also being treated for tumor lysis syndrome with hydration and a uricase inhibitor. The renal consult suggests a likely diagnosis of uric acid nephropathy, and renal failure management includes IV hydration and urine alkalinization. DIC management involves monitoring platelet count, fibrin degradation products (FDP), hepatocellular injury markers, and coagulation profile. The patient's LFT abnormalities may be due to tumor infiltration of the liver or other causes, and further evaluation is planned.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control with insulin infusion, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with famotidine. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also being provided. The patient's code status remains as full code, and the plan is to extubate him today.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include worsening respiratory failure, cardiac complications such as CHF or NSTEMI, septic shock, tumor lysis syndrome, renal failure, DIC, and liver dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate management strategies will be necessary to address these potential complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The note details the patient's chief complaint, which includes respiratory failure and shock. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU.

From the note, it appears that the patient may be experiencing several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Myocardial Infarction (MI), specifically an acute MI. The note mentions the presence of moderate AS (aortic stenosis), mild LV regional systolic dysfunction, and no vegetations seen on transesophageal echocardiography.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is indicated by the patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels and the need for mechanical ventilation.

3. Leukemia, acute (ALL or AML). The note mentions a high WBC count and abnormal differential.

4. Renal Failure, acute (ARF). The note mentions elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

5. Hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate) and Hypocalcemia (low calcium), which are consistent with tumor lysis syndrome.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to note that further evaluation and testing would be necessary to confirm these conditions."

   72 y/o man with secondary AML presented with shock, respiratory
   failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following
   trasfusions at [**Hospital1 358**].  He has now improved substantially.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - hold sedation and pursue formal SBT
   - if passes and wakes up
 trial of extubation
   - differential includes [**Doctor Last Name 11**], TRALI, TACO, and pneumonia (less likely
   but not excluded)
   - TRALI and acute diastolic CHF are probably most likely
   - PE unlikely given improvement without therapy and thrombocytopenia
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   - heme/onc consult appreciated
   - no acute therapy indicated at this time
 SHOCK
   - resolved
   - cover empirically for pneumonia
 FEVER
   - follow cultures
   - if further LFT elevation, RUQ ultrasound
 NSTEMI
   - most likely related to demand or some leukostasis
   - echo suggests that there may have been some infarct rather than just
   diffuse demand; however, overall function is preserved
   - not eligible for aspirin given platelets.  Can consider beta blocker
   once off pressors for a day or two
 TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a diagnosis of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented with shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following transfusions. The patient has now improved substantially.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, and we should consider holding sedation and pursuing a formal spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) if the patient's condition improves. If the SBT is successful, a trial of extubation may be considered.

2. Leukemia (acute): The patient has a history of secondary AML. A heme/onc consult is appreciated, and no acute therapy is indicated at this time.

3. Shock: The patient's shock has resolved, but we should continue to cover empirically for pneumonia due to the risk of infection. Further evaluation for the cause of shock may be necessary.

4. Fever: The patient's fever should be followed, and cultures should be obtained. If there is further elevation in liver function tests (LFTs), a RUQ ultrasound may be considered.

5. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient may have had an NSTEMI related to demand or leukostasis. An echocardiogram suggests possible infarct rather than diffuse demand, but overall function is preserved. Aspirin is not"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), currently being treated for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) vs. Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) vs. septic shock. The patient is also suspected to have Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced liver injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing, which can be due to ARDS or TRALI. Close monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation may be required.
2. Septic shock: The patient's vital signs indicate low blood pressure and rapid heart rate, suggesting septic shock. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and administration of appropriate antibiotics are necessary.
3. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): The patient's high white blood cell count and elevated levels of potassium and phosphate suggest TLS. Proper hydration and administration of medications to prevent complications such as renal failure and cardiac arrhythmias are needed.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate renal failure. Renal consult and appropriate management, such as dialysis, may be required.
5. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's elevated D-dimer levels and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They have been intubated and are receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and mildly low blood pressure. Fluid balance indicates a negative balance, suggesting potential dehydration. The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal limits, and their ABG results are within normal range as well.

The patient's lab results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets, but there are elevated levels of creatinine and lactate. Electrolyte levels such as potassium, sodium, and chloride are within normal range, while calcium and magnesium levels are slightly low. Liver enzymes and kidney function tests are also within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and no signs of chest pain or distress. Neurological examination shows the patient to be alert and oriented, with purposeful movements and normal muscle tone.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including myocardial infarction, tumor lysis syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leukemia, acute renal failure, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. The ICU care plan includes ongoing monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory parameters. Nutritional support and glycemic control are also being provided. The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, so appropriate prophylactic measures are being implemented."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o man with secondary AML presented with shock, respiratory
   failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following
   trasfusions at [**Hospital1 358**].  He has now improved substantially.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - differential includes [**Doctor Last Name 11**], TRALI, TACO, and pneumonia (less likely
   but not excluded)
   - TRALI and acute diastolic CHF are probably most likely
   - PE unlikely given improvement without therapy and thrombocytopenia
   - extubation trial today
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   - heme/onc consult appreciated
   - no acute therapy indicated at this time
 SHOCK
   - resolved. Etiology remains unclear.
   - covering empirically for pneumonia
 FEVER
   - follow cultures
   - if further LFT elevation, RUQ ultrasound
 NSTEMI
   - most likely related to demand or some leukostasis
   - echo with regional wall motion abnormalities suggests that there may
   have been some infarct rather than just diffuse demand; however,
   overall function is preserved
   - not eligible for aspirin given platelets.  Can consider beta blocker
   once off pressors for a day or two

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old man with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented with shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following transfusions at Hospital1. The patient has now improved substantially.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to an underlying condition such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), acute dysplastic heart failure (TACO), or pneumonia. Extubation trial is planned today.

2. Leukemia, Acute: The patient has acute leukemia, but no immediate therapy is indicated at this time. A heme/onc consult is appreciated.

3. Shock: The patient's shock has resolved, but the etiology remains unclear. Empirical coverage for pneumonia is being provided.

4. Fever: Follow cultures and consider further liver function test (LFT) elevation and right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound if indicated.

5. Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient most likely had an NSTEMI related to demand or leukostasis. An echocardiogram with regional wall motion abnormalities suggests there may have been some infarct rather than just diffuse demand. However, overall function is preserved. The patient is not eligible for aspirin due to thrombocytopenia, but beta-blocker therapy can be"

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - differential includes [**Doctor Last Name 11**], TRALI, TACO, and pneumonia (less likely
   but not excluded)
   - TRALI and acute diastolic CHF are probably most likely
   - PE unlikely given improvement without therapy and thrombocytopenia
   - extubation trial today
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   - heme/onc consult appreciated
   - no acute therapy indicated at this time
 SHOCK
   - resolved
   - cover empirically for pneumonia
 FEVER
   - follow cultures
   - if further LFT elevation, RUQ ultrasound
 NSTEMI
   - most likely related to demand or some leukostasis
   - echo suggests that there may have been some infarct rather than just
   diffuse demand; however, overall function is preserved
   - not eligible for aspirin given platelets.  Can consider beta blocker

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented with shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following transfusions at Hospital1. He has now improved substantially. The patient's current conditions include acute respiratory failure, leukemia, shock (resolved), fever, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), tumor lysis syndrome, and acute renal failure. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to various causes such as pneumonia, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), trauma-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (TACO), or pulmonary embolism (PE). Given the improvement without therapy and thrombocytopenia, PE is less likely. TRALI and acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) are the most probable causes. Extubation trial today should be considered.

2. Leukemia: The patient has acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although no acute therapy is indicated at this time, a heme/onc consult is appreciated. Monitoring the patient's blood counts and managing any complications related to leukemia, such as tumor lysis syndrome, is important.

3. Shock: The patient initially presented with shock, which has now"

   Imaging: CT head
   1.  No acute intracranial pathology identified.  Please note MRI is
   more
   sensitive for evaluation of ischemia or lymphomatous involvement.
   2.  Chronic appearing sinus changes with suggestive element of acute
   sinusitis
   involving the left maxillary sinusitis.  This should be correlated with
   clinical exam.
   CT spine
   1.  No acute pathology to explain the patient's upper extremity
   neurologic
   findings.  Please note, MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of cord
   pathology.
   2.  Right apical ground-glass opacity is nonspecific and may represent
   underlying infection or alveolar edema.

   # Hypox Res Failure
   Differential still wide: vol overload (TACO) vs TRALI post
   transfusion.  Also, w/ gram + cocci in sputum, concern for infectious
   etiology.  Leukostasis and ARDS less likely.  Now extubated and doing
   well.  Cont titrate O2.  Re-intubation not likely to add length or
   quality of life.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He has been in the ICU for several days and has received treatment for various conditions, including bacterial pneumonia, NSTEMI, and sinusitis. The patient's mental status is improving after being extubated, but he is still somnolent and unable to follow commands. Physical examination reveals extreme pitting edema and a harsh holosystolic murmur over the left lower sternal border. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and troponin-T levels. Imaging studies do not show any acute intracranial or spinal pathology. The patient has a history of AML and has received blood transfusions. His condition is complex, with multiple potential complications such as volume overload (TACO), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), bacterial pneumonia, and cardiogenic shock (CARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload (TACO): The patient's fluid balance shows a significant positive balance, indicating possible volume overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function.
2. Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI): Given the patient's recent blood transfusions and the presence of hypoxemic respiratory failure, there is a concern for TRALI. This condition is characterized by acute lung injury following transfusion and can present with similar symptoms to the patient's"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has been extubated and needs to follow up with OSH blood bank for infection. Additionally, the sputum gram stain showed gram + cocci in clusters and pairs, which may indicate a bacterial infection. The blood cultures are pending, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and the differential diagnosis included CHF/TACO, ARDS, TRALI, and leukostasis. The rapid resolution of respiratory failure suggests the possibility of TACO (transfusion-associated circulatory overload) or TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury). Further evaluation is necessary to determine the exact cause.

3. Septic shock: The patient's shock is initially suspected to be cardiogenic with NSTEMI or septic shock. The presence of sepsis and PNA (pneumonia) as potential causes of septic shock should be closely monitored and treated accordingly.

4. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient has leukocytosis and uric acid nephropathy, which are suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome. Close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is necessary.

5. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure, possibly due to uric acid nephropathy. A renal consult is appreciated, and the patient's urine output should be closely monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is now presenting with TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury), TACO (transusion-associated circulatory overload), or septic shock. The patient was previously intubated but has been extubated and is showing signs of hypoxemic respiratory failure. An echocardiogram revealed some hypokinesis, suggesting possible congestive heart failure or TACO. The patient's respiratory status has rapidly improved since extubation.

The patient's current medical conditions include altered mental status, likely due to sedation or watershed infarct, as well as improving renal failure. The patient's white blood cell count has increased to over 100, which may indicate leukostasis. There are concerns about the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome, and allopurinol has been started for uric acid management. Pain, constipation, and liver function abnormalities are also being addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. TRALI vs TACO vs Septic Shock: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to TRALI, TACO, or septic shock. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. CHF/TACO vs TRALI: Given the rapid resolution of respiratory status and evidence of hypokinesis on echocardiogram, the patient most likely has congestive heart failure or TACO"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall individual who presented with respiratory distress. They were extubated yesterday at 11 AM. The patient has a history of rising uric acid levels, for which allopurinol has been requested by the BMT (likely Bone Marrow Transplant). The patient has no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 108 bpm with sinus tachycardia, a blood pressure ranging from 134/56 mmHg to 158/75 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on a face tent with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,227 mL, with 795 mL given through intravenous fluids. Their total output was 2,630 mL, including 1,120 mL of urine output. The patient's respiratory support consists of being on standby ventilation with a face tent, with a tidal volume of 548 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 223.

   Assessment and Plan
    72 y/o man with secondary AML presented with shock, respiratory
   failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following
   trasfusions at [**Hospital1 358**].  He has now improved substantially.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - differential includes [**Doctor Last Name 11**], TRALI, TACO, and pneumonia (less likely
   but not excluded)
   - TRALI and acute diastolic CHF are probably most likely given rapid
   resolution
   - sucessfully extubated yesterday
   - Mental Status: only opening eyes, moaning, occ answering questions, -
   DDx delayed clearance of medication, last head
   CT after off pressors without evidence for bleed or acute ischemia,
   check ABG to exclude hypercarbia.
   This is a difficult situation but we must treat pain to see if that
   helps with his mental status a bit- he is chronically on narcotics/
   Suspect this will continue to clear through the day, if persiosts will
   need to consider repeat imaging
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   - heme/onc consult appreciated
   - WBC is rising to pver 100K and 42% blasts
 clarify with them
   indications for Rx
   - Allopurinol for tumor lysis
 SHOCK
   - resolved. Etiology remains unclear.
   - covering empirically for pneumonia
 FEVER
   - follow cultures
   - if further LFT elevation, RUQ ultrasound
 NSTEMI
   - most likely related to demand or some leukostasis
   - echo with regional wall motion abnormalities suggests that there may
   have been some infarct rather than just diffuse demand; however,
   overall function is preserved
   - not eligible for aspirin given platelets.  Would add b blocker low

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with secondary acute myeloid leukemia who presented with shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following transfusions at Hospital1 358. He has now improved substantially. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday but is experiencing delirium, moaning, and difficulty following commands. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/56 mmHg to 158/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on face tent with FiO2 of 40%, and temperature within normal range. The patient has a history of allergies to no drugs and has received various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 104.7 K/uL and 42% blasts, elevated uric acid levels, and abnormalities in other lab parameters such as creatinine, glucose, and liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, leukemia, shock, fever, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute renal failure. The plan includes treating pain, addressing delirium, providing appropriate nutrition and glycemic control, removing unnecessary lines, administering prophylactic medications, and addressing potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with secondary acute myeloid leukemia who presented with shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome after transfusions at another hospital. He has now improved significantly. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience delayed clearance of medication, hypercarbia, or pneumonia. TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) and acute diastolic CHF (congestive heart failure) are the most likely causes.
2. Leukemia, Acute: The patient has rising WBC count and 42% blasts. He requires a heme/onc consult to determine the indications for treatment, including the use of allopurinol for tumor lysis.
3. Shock: The etiology of the shock remains unclear, but it has resolved. The patient is being covered empirically for pneumonia and may require further evaluation if there is further LFT elevation.
4. Fever: Follow cultures and consider RUQ ultrasound if further LFT elevation occurs.
5. NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction): The patient may have had some infarct rather than just diffuse demand, but overall function is preserved. An echo with regional wall motion abnormalities is needed, and consideration can be given to beta-blocker therapy once off pressors for a day or two.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and hypoxia. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in oxygen saturation levels despite receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient also experienced pain, fever, and difficulty passing stool. The patient's vital signs indicate an elevated heart rate and slightly low blood pressure. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications, including morphine for pain management. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count and elevated lactate levels. Imaging and microbiology tests are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia and the need for supplemental oxygen suggest a potential risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The combination of fever, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels raises concern for sepsis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and careful fluid management should be continued.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and fluctuating level of consciousness may indicate delirium. Frequent reorientation and sedation adjustment may be required.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings should be implemented.
5. Stress Ulcer Bleeding:"

   Assessment and Plan
    72 y/o man with secondary AML presented with shock, respiratory
   failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following
   trasfusions at [**Hospital1 358**].  We were able to extubate and resp status
   stable but mental status porr and WBC is rapidly rapidly rising
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   - heme/onc consult appreciated. This rapid rise in WBC with blasts is
   extremely concerning today.
   We will initiate family meeting with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 383**] ourselves and family
   today.
   Not a candidate for pheresis, could consideer Hydrea but overall
   prognosis is very poor
   - Allopurinol for tumor lysis
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - differential includes [**Doctor Last Name 11**], TRALI, TACO, and pneumonia (less likely
   but not excluded)
   - TRALI and acute diastolic CHF are probably most likely given rapid
   resolution
   - sucessfully extubated 48 hrs ago
   - Now at risk for leukostasis
   - Mental Status: only opening eyes, moaning, occ answering questions, -
   DDx delayed clearance of medication, last head
   CT after off pressors without evidence for bleed or acute ischemia,
   check ABG to exclude hypercarbia.
   This is a difficult situation but we must treat pain to see if that
   helps with his mental status a bit- he is chronically on narcotics/
   Suspect this will continue to clear through the day, if persiosts will
   need to consider repeat imaging
 SHOCK
   - resolved. Etiology remains unclear.
   - covering empirically for pneumonia
 FEVER
   - follow cultures
   - if further LFT elevation, RUQ ultrasound
 NSTEMI
   - most likely related to demand or some leukostasis
   - echo with regional wall motion abnormalities suggests that there may
   have been some infarct rather than just diffuse demand; however,
   overall function is preserved
   - not eligible for aspirin given platelets.  Would add b blocker low
   dose
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   - improving

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented with shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following transfusions. He was successfully extubated 48 hours ago but is now experiencing confusion and pain post-extubation. He has an increased oxygen requirement and is on a face tent. His temperature is 100.8 degrees Celsius and he has been cultured. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/56 to 156/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His blood culture was taken at 04:21 AM on 04/03/2107. 

The patient's medications include levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and vancomycin, which were administered on 03/31/2107 and 04/03/2107. He also receives other ICU medications such as famotidine (Pepcid), metoprolol, docusate, SSRI, allopurinol, lopressor, and lorazepam. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is thin, unresponsive, slightly labored breathing, with poor air movement and no wheezes. His neurologic examination shows that he responds to tactile stimulation,"

 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)

   extremely concerning today.
   We will initiate family meeting with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 383**] ourselves and family
   today.
   Not a candidate for pheresis, could consideer Hydrea but overall
   prognosis is very poor
   - Allopurinol for tumor lysis
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - differential includes [**Doctor Last Name 11**], TRALI, TACO, and pneumonia (less likely
   but not excluded)
   - TRALI and acute diastolic CHF are probably most likely given rapid
   resolution
   - sucessfully extubated 48 hrs ago
   - Now at risk for leukostasis
   - Mental Status: only opening eyes, moaning, occ answering questions, -
   DDx delayed clearance of medication, last head
   CT after off pressors without evidence for bleed or acute ischemia,
   check ABG to exclude hypercarbia.
   This is a difficult situation but we must treat pain to see if that
   helps with his mental status a bit- he is chronically on narcotics/
   Suspect this will continue to clear through the day, if persiosts will
   need to consider repeat imaging

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old man with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented with shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following transfusions at Hospital1. The patient was extubated and his respiratory status is stable, but he has poor mental status and a rapidly rising white blood cell count (WBC). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Leukostasis: Due to the rapid rise in WBC with blasts, there is concern for leukostasis, which can lead to respiratory distress and acute respiratory failure.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's presentation includes acute respiratory failure, which may be due to ARDS. This can be caused by various factors, including sepsis, pneumonia, or trauma.
3. Tumor lysis syndrome: Given the patient's leukemia diagnosis, there is a risk of tumor lysis syndrome, which is a metabolic complication that can occur after treatment of cancer, particularly hematologic malignancies.
4. Infection: The patient has fever, and cultures have been obtained. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust the antibiotic therapy accordingly.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has an NSTEMI, likely"

   Assessment and Plan
    72 y/o man with secondary AML presented with shock, respiratory
   failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following
   trasfusions at [**Hospital1 358**].  We were able to extubate and resp status
   stable but mental status porr and WBC is rapidly rapidly rising
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   - heme/onc consult appreciated. This rapid rise in WBC with blasts is
   extremely concerning today.
   We will initiate family meeting with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 383**] ourselves and family
   today.
   Not a candidate for pheresis, could consideer Hydrea but overall
   prognosis is very poor
   - Allopurinol for tumor lysis
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - differential includes [**Doctor Last Name 11**], TRALI, TACO, and pneumonia (less likely
   but not excluded)
   - TRALI and acute diastolic CHF are probably most likely given rapid
   resolution
   - sucessfully extubated 48 hrs ago
   - Now at risk for leukostasis
   - Mental Status: only opening eyes, moaning, occ answering questions, -
   DDx delayed clearance of medication, last head
   CT after off pressors without evidence for bleed or acute ischemia,
   check ABG to exclude hypercarbia.
   This is a difficult situation but we must treat pain to see if that
   helps with his mental status a bit- he is chronically on narcotics/
   Suspect this will continue to clear through the day, if persiosts will
   need to consider repeat imaging
 SHOCK
   - resolved. Etiology remains unclear.
   - covering empirically for pneumonia
 FEVER
   - follow cultures
   - if further LFT elevation, RUQ ultrasound
 NSTEMI
   - most likely related to demand or some leukostasis
   - echo with regional wall motion abnormalities suggests that there may
   have been some infarct rather than just diffuse demand; however,
   overall function is preserved
   - not eligible for aspirin given platelets.  Would add b blocker low
   dose
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   - improving

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Family meeting held x 30 min with BMT attg [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 384**] [**Doctor Last Name 383**] who
   reviewed grave prognosis with blast crisis and felt a transition to CMO
   was indicated. Family agreed that this fight had been long and hard but
   was now at an end. At this point goal was quality of life and all
   shouldl be done ot minimize suffering. Will we initiate morphine for
   comfort and further discuss with family as afternoon progresses. Many
   family yet to arrive but will be updated as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented with shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and likely tumor lysis syndrome following transfusions at Hospital1. He was successfully extubated 48 hours ago but now has confusion and pain after extubation. He is on low-dose morphine for pain management. The patient has a rapid rise in white blood cell count (WBC) with blasts, which is concerning for leukemia. The overall prognosis is very poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukostasis: Due to the rapid rise in WBC with blasts, the patient is at risk for leukostasis, which can lead to respiratory distress and failure.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, and the differential includes TRALI (Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury), TACO (Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload), pneumonia (less likely but not excluded), and delayed clearance of medication.
3. Shock: The patient's shock has resolved, but the etiology remains unclear. Empirical coverage for pneumonia is being provided.
4. Fever: The patient has a fever, and cultures have been obtained. If further liver function test (LFT) elevation occurs, a right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound may be considered.
5. NSTEMI: The patient may have had a non-ST-elevation myocardial inf"
