   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   82 y/o woman with history of breast Ca and cerebral aneuysym admitted
   to the ICU with cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure
    # Septic Shock: source cholangitis, ERCP with pus drainage. Hopefully
   she will do well. Continues to demonstrate septic physiology with
   pressor requirment.
   - mixed venous 02
   - titrate CVP to 12 w/fluid bolus
   - wean levophed as tolerated with CVP ~12
   - Vanc/Zosyn
   - Aline, CVL
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to metabolic acidosis and
   inability to compensate. Interestingly, however, is her elevated
   bicarbonate which could be from a higher level at baseline or from a
   contraction alkalosis.  Currently intubated on Assist control 500 x 14
   w/5 peep and oxygenating well on 60%.
   - wean Fi02 to 40%
   - check ABgs to see if pH treding toward normal.  Would not
   overventilate as I suspect her pCO2 is somewhat elevated given her age
   and elevated bicarbonates in the past (~30). Maintain current minute
   ventilation and monitor PH. Woudl expect as sepsis resolves her pH
   trends towards normal.
   - If pH normal then could change to pressure support and begin weanign
   process. Do not expect her to be intuabed long as her lungs were ok
   prior to admission
   # Cholangitis: Vanco / Zosyn as above. No large stones seen.
   - plans per ERCP
   - NPO for now
   - stent removal in future
    # Hypertension:  hold antihypertensives
    # Breast Cancer: not active issue, outpatient follow up
    # Cerebral Aneurysm: care with pressors, keep MAP ~60, 65 not higher
    # Depression: continue antidepressents
   # Hypercholesterolemia: hold statin for now, restart when LFTs trendign
   toward normal
    # Access: Rihgt IJ, Aline, also 2 PIVs
   # FEN: NPO
   # PPx: famotidine, heparin SQ

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and cerebral aneurysm admitted to the ICU with cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure.
- The patient has been experiencing septic physiology with pressor requirements, indicating ongoing sepsis.
- She is intubated on assist control ventilation with FiO2 set at 50% and PEEP at 8 cmH2O, oxygenating well.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and metabolic acidosis.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/54 to 131/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 6,390 mL and output of 2,707 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,683 mL.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam), sedatives (Propofol), vasopressor (Norepinephrine), and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock and ongoing sepsis indicated by the need for pressors and persistent hypotension. Close monitoring and aggressive management are required to prevent further deterioration.

   82 yo female admit with cholangitis and now s/p ERCP.  She had
   significant sepsis and with stent relieving obstruction rapid wean of
   pressors was performed.  Now she has had return to pressor requirement
   despite optimized volume status--this is in the absence of significant
   fever but with persistent bandemia.

Patient with intubationin the setting of sepsis
   and cholangitis.  She has had substantial improvement in her
   oxygenation and ventilation with good preservation of aeration on CXR-
   -Will move to PSV today
   -Will trial RSBI and 1 hour SBT prior to extubation to consider
   possible successful extubation today
   -If mental status and CVP/fluid status favorable will move to

","The patient is an 82-year-old female admitted with cholangitis and sepsis. She underwent an ERCP procedure and had a rapid wean of pressors after the stent relieved the obstruction. However, she now requires pressor support again despite being in an optimized volume status. There is no significant fever but there is persistent bandemia.

The patient has respiratory failure and is currently intubated due to sepsis and cholangitis. She has shown substantial improvement in oxygenation and ventilation, with good preservation of aeration on CXR. The plan is to move to pressure support ventilation (PSV) today and trial rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) prior to extubation. If her mental status and central venous pressure/fluid status are favorable, she will be considered for extubation today.

The patient is also experiencing shock and sepsis. She is receiving Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam antibiotics. The plan is to move to diuresis today as tolerated.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on NPO status given the possibility of extubation. Glycemic control will be maintained, and she has multiple lumen lines, an arterial line, and prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. VAP precautions will be followed.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is currently ICU"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and cerebral aneurysm admitted to the ICU with cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and unable to provide a history. The patient has been experiencing septic physiology, requiring the use of norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. Her CVP is consistently around 10, indicating possible fluid overload. Blood cultures have shown positive results for gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient is receiving antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) and has undergone an ERCP procedure with pus drainage. Her respiratory failure is likely secondary to metabolic acidosis, and she is currently on assisted ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient continues to demonstrate septic physiology despite receiving appropriate antibiotics. This indicates that there may be a persistent source of infection or inadequate antibiotic coverage. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters is necessary to ensure early detection and management of septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate ventilation and compensation for metabolic acidosis may lead to further respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of ABGs and adjustment of ventilator settings will be crucial in managing this condition.
3. Cholangitis: Although no large stones were seen during the ERCP procedure, the patient still requires further management for cholangitis. This may include stent removal and follow-up"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and cerebral aneurysm. She was admitted to the ICU with cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. She has been experiencing septic physiology, requiring pressor support. Her respiratory failure is likely secondary to metabolic acidosis and the inability to compensate. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown positive response to pressure support ventilation (PSV). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient has been diagnosed with cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. It is important to continue treating the infection with appropriate antibiotics and consider further interventions such as ERCP for drainage.

2. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection leading to low blood pressure and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and management of her hemodynamic status with appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are necessary.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to metabolic acidosis. Close monitoring of ABGs (arterial blood gases) is required to assess her respiratory function. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to the patient's inability to maintain adequate ventilation.

4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and antihypertensive medications should be held for now.

5. Breast Cancer: Although not currently an active issue, the patient's history of"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female admitted with biliary obstruction and ascending cholangitis. She has shown stability in her blood pressure following decompression and drainage. The patient has been able to wean off pressors and maintain a stable blood pressure. She also tolerated minimal ventilatory settings well and has had her sedation weaned off, displaying excellent mental status and the ability to follow commands.

The patient initially required intubation due to altered mental status, sepsis, and respiratory failure. However, she is now alert and able to follow commands clearly. Her respiratory status has improved, and she meets the criteria for extubation. The plan is to extubate the patient today, checking for a cuff leak prior to doing so. She will be moved out of bed to a chair and encouraged to use incentive spirometry.

The patient is being treated for septic shock with Vancomycin and Zosyn. She will continue to receive IV fluids as needed and follow-up with culture results.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on nutritional restriction (npo) this morning. Her glycemic control will be monitored. She has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line. Prophylactic measures include boots to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis, and measures to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls with respiratory system assessment before int"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o woman with history of lung Ca and cerebral aneuysym admitted to
   the ICU with cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure
    # Septic Shock:  Patient admitted with hypotension and 2 GNR isolates
   as well as GPC
s in blood cultures.  The presumed source of this
   infection was her cholangitis and she is s/p ERCP and drainage of pus.
   Follow-up blood cultures remain negative and she has been successfully
   weaned off pressors.
   - Vanc/Zosyn
   - Will d/c CVL after peripheral access established
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient
s ventilation and oxygenation are stable
   since extubation though she does have some persistent hypercapnea.  Her
   respiratory failure was presumed due to volume overload in the setting
   of aggressive fluid resuscitation.   Currently this seems to be
   improved.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of lung cancer and cerebral aneurysm admitted to the ICU for cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. She has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. The source of infection is presumed to be her cholangitis, and she underwent ERCP with drainage of pus. The patient's blood cultures have remained negative, and she has been successfully weaned off pressors. She remains intubated but is stable in terms of ventilation and oxygenation. Her respiratory failure was likely due to volume overload from aggressive fluid resuscitation. There are no large stones seen in the cholangitis. The patient also has hypertension, breast cancer (not currently active), cerebral aneurysm, depression, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. She has multiple lines and tubes in place, including a right internal jugular central line, peripheral intravenous lines, and a multi-lumen central line. She is NPO (nothing by mouth) and on various medications including metoprolol for tachyarrhythmias and furosemide for fluid management. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock due to an infection, specifically from her cholangitis. There is a risk of ongoing sepsis if the infection is"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of lung cancer and cerebral aneurysm. She was admitted to the ICU with cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. 

The patient initially presented with hypotension and two Gram-negative bacterial isolates in her blood cultures, along with Gram-positive cocci. The presumed source of infection was her cholangitis, and she underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and drainage of pus. 

Follow-up blood cultures have remained negative, and the patient has been successfully weaned off pressors. She is currently being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin for the infection. The central venous line (CVL) will be discontinued once peripheral access is established.

The patient's respiratory failure was likely due to volume overload resulting from aggressive fluid resuscitation. However, her ventilation and oxygenation are now stable since extubation, although she still experiences some persistent hypercapnia. 

The cholangitis has been decompressed, but she will require another ERCP after recovery to remove a large stone. A stent removal in the future and follow-up ERCP recommendations are also planned. Serial abdominal exams will be monitored to assess her condition.

Additionally, the patient has hypertension, lung cancer (not currently an active issue), cerebral aneurysm (with low tolerance for hypertension), depression (contin"

   to the ICU with cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure
    # Septic Shock: source cholangitis, ERCP with pus drainage. Continues
   to demonstrate septic physiology with pressor requirment. Levo weaned
   overnight but had to be increased again this afternoon. CVP
   consistently ~10 today and pt looks edematous. Think has enough fluid
   on board at this time.
   -  wean levophed as tolerated to MAP >65
   - Vanc/Zosyn
   - Aline, CVL
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to metabolic acidosis and
   inability to compensate. Originally, Bicarb was elevated but has since
   declined to 19. Pt needs to hyperventilate approx 10% to compensate for
   this. While trying to wean to PS today, pt unable to do this, unable to
   maintain 7.5L minute ventilation as ABGs showed pH dropped and pt was
   put back on a/c
   - rest on a/c overnight. Trial of PS again tomorrow while monitoring
   ABG to check if pt able to maintain nl pH by adequate respiratory
   alkalosis in compensation for metabolic acidosis.
   # Cholangitis: Vanco / Zosyn as above. No large stones seen.
   - NPO for now
   - stent removal in future
   -f/u ERCP recs.
    # Hypertension:  hold antihypertensives
    # Breast Cancer: not active issue, outpatient follow up
    # Cerebral Aneurysm: care with pressors, keep MAP ~60, 65 not higher
    # Depression: continue antidepressents
   # Hypercholesterolemia: hold statin for now, restart when LFTs trendign
   toward normal
    # Access: Right IJ, Aline, also 2 PIVs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and cerebral aneurysm. She was admitted to the ICU with cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving treatment for septic shock, respiratory failure, and cholangitis. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has required pressor support. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein, and signs of metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition indicates sepsis due to cholangitis. Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and can lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's sepsis has progressed to septic shock, characterized by persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Septic shock can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and has a high mortality rate.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to metabolic acidosis and an inability to compensate. This can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, leading to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis requires urgent intervention, and she is currently being managed with antibiotics and planned ERCP. If left untreated or if there is a recurrence of infection, cholangitis can lead to liver abscess formation, b"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o woman with history of lung Ca and cerebral aneuysym admitted to
   the ICU with cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure
   # Septic Shock:  Patient admitted with hypotension and 2 GNR isolates
   as well as GPC
s in blood cultures.  The presumed source of this
   infection was her cholangitis and she is s/p ERCP and drainage of pus.
   Follow-up blood cultures remain negative and she has been successfully
   weaned off pressors.
   - Pipercillin/tazobactam
   -Vancomycin for GPC
   - Will d/c CVL after peripheral access established
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient
s ventilation and oxygenation are stable
   since extubation though she does have some persistent hypercapnea.  Her
   respiratory failure was presumed due to volume overload in the setting
   of aggressive fluid resuscitation.   Currently this seems to be
   improved.
   -supplementary O2 PRN
   -low index of suspicion to repeat ABG for mental status changes
   # Cholangitis: Vanco / Zosyn as above. system has been decompressed but
   will need repeat ERCP after recovery to remove large stone.
   -stent removal in future
   -f/u ERCP reccs.
   -monitor serial abdominal exams
    # Hypertension:  hold antihypertensives except BB for the moment until
   longer w/o hypotension
    # Lung Cancer: not active issue, outpatient follow up
    # Cerebral Aneurysm: low tolerance for hypertension
   # Depression: continue antidepressents

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of lung cancer and cerebral aneurysm. She was admitted to the ICU with cholangitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. Over the past day, the patient has remained stable with no major complications. She has been on supplemental oxygen and has shown intermittent confusion, which is presumed to be post-infectious. Blood cultures revealed two isolates of E. coli and one isolate of Streptococcus anginosus. The patient received haloperidol for agitation, which was effective. She has been successfully weaned off pressors and her respiratory support has been reduced to a nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 113/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Fluid balance is also within normal limits. The patient's lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, but overall are stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure, but since extubation, her ventilation and oxygenation have been stable. However, she still has persistent hypercapnea. Close monitoring and supplemental oxygen will be required to prevent further respiratory complications.
2. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis has been decompressed, but"
