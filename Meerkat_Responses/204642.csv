   Imaging: [**2131-3-15**] CXR:
   [**2132-3-13**] Chest CT:
   Distal left subclavian and left axillary veins are only poorly contrast
   opacified and not well evaluated. Pacemaker leads traverse the more
   proximal left subclavian and brachiocephalic veins, limiting evauation
   of these vessles. No thrombus in SVC. Appearance of lungs unchanged in
   short interval.
   1. Findings are consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Followup study in
   six to eight weeks is recommended after appropriate treatment to
   document evolution.
   2. Small right pleural effusion, minimal also on the left.
   3. 9-mm nodule in the right lower lobe which should be reevaluated on
   the followup study.
   4. Cardiomegaly.
   5. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy
   .
   [**3-11**] CXR:
   No interval change over one day in appearance of diffuse airspace
   opacity involving the right hemithorax. Additional opacity seen in the
   left base, also unchanged. Original differential diagnosis stands and
   multifocal pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   .
   [**2132-3-12**] LUE Ultrasound:
   Slow flow in subclavian, axillary and to a lesser extent, brachial and
   basilic veins. It is difficult to exclude nonocclusive thrombus in the
   axillary vein, although the findings are overall suggestive of a more
   central venous stenosis, which could relate to the presence of
   pacemaker leads. These results were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5796**]. If
   clinically feasible, a contrast- enhanced CT of the chest may be
   helpful.
   .
   4/13 L spine Xray:
   Marked lumbar spondylosis without spondylolisthesis or fracture.
   Ill-defined density projecting over the intertrochanteric region of the
   right femur. The finding is not well localized on the single frontal
   view. Given the submitted history of prostate cancer, dedicated
   radiographs of the right hip are recommended for better localization
   and characterization.
   .
   [**2132-3-10**] Renal U/S:
   No left renal stone. Small left renal cyst. Bladder could not
   be evaluated fully.
   .
   [**2131-2-1**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of
   all left ventricular segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, prostate cancer, and cardiac catheterization who presented with a dry cough. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy. The patient has diffuse right peripheral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and his arterial blood gas analysis shows severe hypoxemia and hypercarbia. The patient's condition is consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), and he has been started on prednisone empirically. Other possible causes include bacterial pneumonia, Churg-Strauss syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, parasitic infection, and neoplasm. Legionella, fungal, and acid-fast cultures have been sent. The patient's left arm is swollen, and a vascular consultation has been requested to evaluate the possibility of pacemaker lead-related venous stenosis. The patient's hypotension was likely due to sedation post-bronchoscopy or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which resolved with fluid resuscitation. He has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% and evidence of pulmonary hypertension. The patient also has acute renal failure with a fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of 0.1%, likely prerenal or contrast-induced. His hypertension is currently being managed with IV fluids. The patient has a history of nonsustained ventricular tach"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and prostate cancer. He presents with dry cough, respiratory distress, and hypoxia, which have led to his admission to the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to bronchoscopy and BAL in the setting of underlying diffuse infiltrates. He also has eosinophilic pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of 30% eosinophils in the BAL fluid and peripheral eosinophilia. Other possible causes of the pneumonia include bacterial infection, but this is less likely given the pulmonary eosinophilia.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia suggest a potential respiratory failure, which could be related to the bronchoscopy and BAL procedure. It is expected to slowly resolve as the BAL fluid reabsorbs. Continuous oxygen therapy should be maintained to maintain the oxygen saturation above 96%.

2. Diffuse Right Peripheral Infiltrates: The patient has diffuse right peripheral infiltrates on chest X-ray. BAL from today shows 30% eosinophils, indicating acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Other possibilities include bacterial pneumonia, but this seems less likely given the presence of pulmonary eosinophilia. Churg-Strauss syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA),"

   Distal left subclavian and left axillary veins are only poorly contrast

   proximal left subclavian and brachiocephalic veins, limiting evauation
   of these vessles. No thrombus in SVC. Appearance of lungs unchanged in

   1. Findings are consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Followup study in
   six to eight weeks is recommended after appropriate treatment to
   document evolution.
   2. Small right pleural effusion, minimal also on the left.
   3. 9-mm nodule in the right lower lobe which should be reevaluated on

   Slow flow in subclavian, axillary and to a lesser extent, brachial and
   basilic veins. It is difficult to exclude nonocclusive thrombus in the

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement, as well as prostate cancer. He presented with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress following bronchoscopy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This is likely related to the bronchoscopy and BAL in the setting of underlying diffuse infiltrates. It is expected to slowly resolve as the BAL fluid reabsorbs.
2. Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates: BAL from today showed 30% eosinophils, along with peripheral eosinophilia, most likely acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Other possibilities include bacterial pneumonia, Churg-Strauss syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, parasitic infection, and neoplasm. A rapid response to steroids is expected if acute eosinophilic pneumonia is confirmed.
3. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive shortly after arrival to the ICU, likely due to sedation post-bronchoscopy or sepsis-induced respiratory failure. It rapidly responded to 1.5L IV fluid resuscitation.
4. Anemia: The patient has been experiencing anemia since February 4th, slowly trending down but without any"

   Imaging: [**2131-3-15**] CXR:
   [**2132-3-13**] Chest CT:
   Distal left subclavian and left axillary veins are only poorly contrast
   opacified and not well evaluated. Pacemaker leads traverse the more
   proximal left subclavian and brachiocephalic veins, limiting evauation
   of these vessles. No thrombus in SVC. Appearance of lungs unchanged in
   short interval.
   1. Findings are consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Followup study in
   six to eight weeks is recommended after appropriate treatment to
   document evolution.
   2. Small right pleural effusion, minimal also on the left.
   3. 9-mm nodule in the right lower lobe which should be reevaluated on
   the followup study.
   4. Cardiomegaly.
   5. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy
   .
   [**3-11**] CXR:
   No interval change over one day in appearance of diffuse airspace
   opacity involving the right hemithorax. Additional opacity seen in the
   left base, also unchanged. Original differential diagnosis stands and
   multifocal pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   .
   [**2132-3-12**] LUE Ultrasound:
   Slow flow in subclavian, axillary and to a lesser extent, brachial and
   basilic veins. It is difficult to exclude nonocclusive thrombus in the
   axillary vein, although the findings are overall suggestive of a more
   central venous stenosis, which could relate to the presence of
   pacemaker leads. These results were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5796**]. If
   clinically feasible, a contrast- enhanced CT of the chest may be
   helpful.
   .
   4/13 L spine Xray:
   Marked lumbar spondylosis without spondylolisthesis or fracture.
   Ill-defined density projecting over the intertrochanteric region of the
   right femur. The finding is not well localized on the single frontal
   view. Given the submitted history of prostate cancer, dedicated
   radiographs of the right hip are recommended for better localization
   and characterization.
   .
   [**2132-3-10**] Renal U/S:
   No left renal stone. Small left renal cyst. Bladder could not
   be evaluated fully.
   .
   [**2131-2-1**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of
   all left ventricular segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), prostate cancer, and chronic systolic heart failure. He presents with dry cough, diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, and respiratory distress. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory failure following a bronchoscopy. He also has peripheral eosinophilia and an eosinophilic presence in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), suggestive of acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Other possible diagnoses include bacterial pneumonia, Churg-Strauss syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), parasitic infection, and neoplasm.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has diffuse right-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, likely related to bronchoscopy and BAL. It is expected to resolve as BAL fluid reabsorbs. The patient should be monitored for ABG results and oxygen saturation levels should be maintained above 96% with the help of supplemental oxygen.
2. Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates: The BAL from today shows 30% eosinophils, along with peripheral eosinophilia, which is consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Other possibilities include bacterial pneumonia, but less likely in the presence"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), prostate cancer, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented with a dry cough, diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, and hypoxia. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress after a bronchoscopy. The patient has been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) and has been started on prednisone therapy. Other possible causes for his respiratory symptoms include bacterial pneumonia, Churg-Strauss vasculitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), parasitic infection, and neoplasm. Legionella and fungal cultures have been obtained. The patient also has left arm swelling, which is believed to be related to the pacemaker leads causing venous return obstruction. His renal function is worsening, and he has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP): The patient has diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, along with peripheral eosinophilia. This suggests the possibility of AEP, which is an interstitial lung disease characterized by pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia.

2. Bacterial pneumonia: Although less likely compared to AEP, bacterial pneumonia should still be considered due to the presence of respiratory symptoms and the fact that the patient is in the ICU.

3. Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS): CSS is a systemic vasculitis associated with asthma and eosinophilia. The patient's peripheral eosinophilia and respiratory symptoms raise the possibility of this condition.

4. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA): ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus species commonly seen in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. The presence of eosinophilia and respiratory symptoms may indicate ABPA.

5. Parasitic infection: Given the patient's eosinophilia, parasitic infections such as Strongyloides stercoralis should also be considered.

6. Neoplasm: Although less likely at this time, neoplastic diseases should be considered given the patient's history of prostate cancer.

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with multiple medical problems, currently admitted to the ICU for right-sided pneumonia (PNA). Despite receiving antibiotics, there has been no improvement, and he underwent a bronchoscopy with subsequent decompensation. The patient was started on prednisone for suspected eosinophilic pneumonia or pulmonary-renal syndrome. His serum creatinine levels are rising, indicating potential renal dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/59 to 80/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. He is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antacids, and heparin. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,580 mL and output of 1,740 mL over the past 24 hours. His urine output is within normal limits at 490 mL. The patient has crackles and wheezing in his right chest and abdominal distension with tympanicity. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated potassium, and decreased albumin levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows some clearing in the right apex. The assessment includes suspected eosinophilic pneumonia, coronary artery disease with previous CABG, and renal failure due to contrast or pulmonary-renal syndrome. The plan involves weaning off oxygen, conducting follow-up bronchoal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including coronary artery disease and a history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He presented with right-sided pneumonia that did not improve with antibiotics, leading to a bronchoscopy. Following the bronchoscopy, the patient decompensated and was started on prednisone for eosinophilic pneumonia or pulmonary-renal syndrome. The patient's creatinine level is rising, indicating possible renal dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/59 mmHg to 134/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin for prophylaxis, pantoprazole, and others for his medical history.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,580 mL, output of 1,740 mL, with positive balances in the urine, NG tube, and drains. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula, and his ABG results are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals no murmur on auscultation, right-sided crackles and wheezing with coughing, and an abdomen that is distended and tympanitic. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's inability"
