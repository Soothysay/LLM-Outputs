","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post three-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), left and right carotid artery stenosis with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) x 2 in [**Country 2032**], peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and bilateral renal artery stenosis treated with stents. The patient was admitted for an elective redo-redo right CEA due to a previous stroke with residual right-sided deficits and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: 
- Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
- Heart rate: 64 bpm (63-68 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 131/58 mmHg (126/53-157/63 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (16-38 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 95% on 4 liters nasal cannula

The patient has a firm hematoma measuring 6x4 cm on the neck. The cardiac examination reveals a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the fifth intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, regurgitation, or gallops, and no thrills or lifts. The lung"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous 3-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), left and right carotid artery stenosis with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) x 2, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and bilateral renal artery stenosis treated with stents.
- The patient was admitted for an elective redo-redo right CEA due to residual right-sided deficits and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient's current medications include atenolol, captopril, aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, ezetimibe, fish oil, and citalopram.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate between 61-69 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 159/55-177/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient's cardiac examination shows a systolic ejection murmur best heard at the upper sternal borders, but no other abnormalities.
- The patient's lung examination reveals right mid lung linear atelectasis, but no overt congestive heart failure (CHF) or fluid"
