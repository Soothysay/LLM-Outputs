","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 20%, refractory ventricular tachycardia ablation, and coronary artery disease post myocardial infarction. He presented with shortness of breath and acute congestive heart failure. The patient has been experiencing episodes of ventricular tachycardia and has been receiving dobutamine therapy. He has responded well to diuresis and has been taking in 1 liter of fluids per day. The patient's renal function is being monitored, and he is showing signs of improvement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
- Refractory Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of refractory VT, which can potentially recur or worsen.
- Heart Failure Exacerbation: Given the patient's poor ejection fraction, there is a risk of further exacerbations of heart failure.

2. Pulmonary Complications:
- Pleural Effusion: The patient has a large right-sided pleural effusion, which may require thoracentesis to relieve symptoms.
- Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral basilar crackles could indicate the presence of pneumonia.

3. Renal Complications:
- Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's rising BUN and creatinine levels suggest possible AKI, which may be due to hypotension or other factors.
- Fluid Overload: Excessive fluid administration could lead to fluid overload and worsen heart failure.

4. Infection:
- Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's leukocytosis and absence of urinary symptoms raise the possibility of a UTI.
- Sepsis: Considering the patient's history of sepsis and current immunocompromised state, there is a risk of developing sepsis.

5. Thrombotic Events:
- Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of hypercoagulability disorder and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. There is a risk of developing DVT, especially with immobilization.

6. Metabolic Imbalances:
- Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's elevated phosphate levels may indicate hyperphosphatemia, which can be a consequence of chronic kidney disease.

7. Psychiatric Complications:
- Depression: The patient's recent hospitalizations and medical conditions may contribute to depression, for which he is receiving treatment.

Please note that this summary and list of potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 20%, refractory ventricular tachycardia ablation, and coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction. He presented with shortness of breath and acute congestive heart failure. The patient has been in the ICU for several days, experiencing episodes of ventricular tachycardia with increased dobutamine dose, subsequently turned off. He has been diuresed well, and his lasix gtt was turned off. A renal consult was requested. The patient has allergies to levofloxacin, hives; cefazolin, nausea/vomiting; and carvedilol, fatigue. His last dose of antibiotics was on [date]. The patient is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and other ICU medications. He is also on multiple oral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and crackles in bilateral lower lobes, along with jugular venous distention and peripheral edema, indicate volume overload. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is significantly elevated from the previous value, suggesting poor cardiac output. The patient's low flow state continues, and he requires careful management of blood pressure and fluid balance to avoid hypoperfusion, especially renal perfusion, as his creatinine and blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old gentleman with h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20%,
   Refractory VT s/p ablation, CAD s/p MI'[**03**], who presented from rehab
   with increasing SOB c/w acute on chronic heart failure.
   .
   #PUMP/ CHF exacerbation: CXR with effusions (right >left) and left
   likely loculated fluid per CT. Clinical exam reveals bilateral basilar
   crackles, JVD 12-13cm and peripheral edema all consistent with volume
   overload. BNP 55,260 (previous BNP 22,000).
   Poor EF of 20% with ischemic cardiomayopathy.  SBPs in 90-114 range now
   so relatively low flow state continues.
   - Increase Dobutamine drip to 7.5mcg/hr, goal MAP>55 to avoid any
   hypoperfusion, especially renal perfusion as Cr/BUN worsening
   -Pressor/Dobutamine for BP control as above and Lasix gtt down to
   5mg/hour for now
   -Goal negative 1L over 24hrs
   -continue 1 L fluid restriction
   -Hold Metoprolol given low BP
   -cath in place now, strict I/Os
   -d/c Lyrica as can contribute to edema/fluid retention state
   .
   # Rhythm: Patient has a history of refractory VT s/p ablation on recent
   admission (after sepsis) and hx of a-fib ablation too.  Currently V
   paced with occasional PVCs.
   - plan to increase pacemaker rate/re-program to 70bpm for better
   cardiac output in face of hypoperfusion risks and poor BPs
   - Continue Mexilitine 200mg PO Q8
   - Continue Amiodarone 200mg PO Q8
   .
   #CAD-Known single valve disease now, first set of CE Trop 0.35 which
   was attributed to CRF.
   - Holding BB
   -Continue statin
   -consider restart ASA prior to d/c (later)
   .
   # Dyspnea : improving, oxygen saturations are 96-97% on room air. CHF
   exacerbation with additional pleural effusion contributing to shortness
   of breath. CT Chest shows large right effusion and loculated small left
   effusion.
   -plan for thoracentesis of R sided effusion over next 48hrs once INR
   down to 1.4-1.5 range and once AMS improves
   -cont to hold Lovenox
   -sent collected pleural fluid for diagnostic cultures/stains/cytology
   given high WBC and possible infection
   .
   AMS- patient very somnolent last night and this morning. Dose of
   Oxycodone decreased to 10mg q12hrs. Avoid any benzos, morphine or
   Ambien for now. Will d/c Lyrica as patient has impaired renal
   metabolism w/ prolonged effects of drug that may be worsening his
   mental status.
   .
   #Constipation: Patient reported constipation on admission which has
   since resolved. Hx of short gut syndrome.
   - Psyllum Wafers
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 1267**], [**Name (NI) **], MOM
   - continue cholestyramine
   .
   #CRI : Patient has a history of CRI, currently Cr 2.2 and BUN 81 (Cr up
   from  baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -increase Dobutamine as above to improve perfusion to kidneys
   -reprogram pacemaker with increased HR to 70bpm for better CO
   -monitor Cr/BUN
   -f/u pm lytes while diuresing
   -f/up Fe-Urea calculations once pending urine lytes return.
   -Renal consult for uremia concerns and rising BUN/Cr
   .
   #Hyperphosphatemia- likely a consequence of his CKD which is probably
   underestimated by his creatinine in the setting of cachexia. Repleted
   today
   .
   #DMII: Will continue home dose NPH, ISS
   .
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has a history of leukocytosis as a consequence
   of MDS. Afebrile. UA showed no infection, no dysuria now. No cough or
   URI sx despite effusions on CT. F/up urine culture, final blood
   cultures
   .
   # Hypercoagulability Disorder: Holding Lovenox while awaiting INR
   decrease for thoracentesis, continue heparin gtt
   .
   #Depression: Continue Citalopram 40mg PO Qday, consider psych consult
   once stabilizes/less lethargic. SW Consult to address family/patient

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 20%, refractory ventricular tachycardia ablation, coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU with shortness of breath and acute congestive heart failure. The patient has been experiencing episodes of ventricular tachycardia with increased dobutamine dose, subsequently turned off. He has been diuresed well, with lasix infusion turned off. A renal consult was requested. The patient has allergies to levofloxacin, cefazolin, carvedilol, dopamine, and heparin. His last dose of antibiotics was on [**2131-10-20**]. He is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and other ICU medications. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/65 mmHg to 113/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced with occasional premature ventricular contractions. His height is 69 inches, and his weight is not provided. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,096 mL and output of 5,130 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -4,034"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) post ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD) post myocardial infarction (MI), and short-gut syndrome with a thrombotic event at the superior mesenteric artery. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) consistent with acute on chronic heart failure. Physical examination revealed bilateral basilar crackles, jugular venous distention (JVD), and peripheral edema, all consistent with volume overload. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), hypercoagulability disorder, and hyperphosphatemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient underwent thoracentesis, which resulted in the removal of 2.1 liters of serous fluid, with laboratory analysis indicating a transudate. He also had a Foley catheter placed for urine output monitoring.

The patient's medications include amiodarone, mexiletine, atorvastatin, cholestyramine, citalopram, enoxaparin sodium, furosemide, ranitidine, and others. His current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 95/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"
