","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who presented with confusion and hypotension following a fall. She was transferred to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite intravenous fluid resuscitation. The patient has a history of frequent falls, poor nutrition, and chronic anemia. Her vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. She is also experiencing respiratory distress, as indicated by an ABG result of ///14/. The patient's physical examination reveals ecchymosis on the head, poor dentition, and muscle wasting. Her neurological assessment shows disorientation, tangential speech, and tremors. Laboratory results indicate abnormal levels of potassium, sodium, magnesium, and liver enzymes. The patient has multiple medical issues, including hypotension, mental status change, possible UTI, anemia, seizure disorder, hypocalcemia/hypomagnesiemia, history of hypothyroidism, transaminitis, and malnutrition. The plan includes further evaluation for cirrhosis, neuro consultation for mental status change, volume repletion, monitoring ABG and lactate levels, continuing Zosyn while awaiting urine culture results, and initiating lactulose. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 56F seizures, falls, and altered mental
   status transferred for hypotension. Patient has history of UTI /
   urosepsis, had negative trauma w/u, groin line placed, sent to floor.
   Overnight, BP trended upward to SBP 80s but pt remains confused and

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of frequent falls, confusion, and hypotension. She was admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite IV fluid resuscitation. The patient has poor nutrition with an albumin level of 1.6 g/dL and chronic anemia. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 31% to 23% overnight, and she received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), which resulted in an appropriate Hct increase but no improvement in mental status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/65 mmHg to 131/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's neurological examination revealed confusion, delusional speech, and no focal deficits. Her cardiovascular examination showed normal sinus rhythm with regular rate and rhythm, rales at the lung bases otherwise clear to auscultation, and soft abdomen with no tenderness or guarding. The patient's extremities were cool and dry with no edema. Her skin was warm.

The patient's laboratory results indicated a white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, sodium of 125 mg/dL, potassium of 3."

   boyfriend reports 80s-90s. She has not been volume responsive, her
   lactate is normal. Differential includes incfection with UTI,
   underlying toxicity from medications, such as her cyclobenzaprine or
   atenolol, but Her HR is 70-80s. It does not appear to be
   cardiac/obstructive (her oxygen saturation is variable due to pleth,
   but she appears not to have significant hypoxia. Patient with very poor
   nutrition/albumin 1.6. Random cortisol [**2181**] - 1.2. Pt also with chronic
   anemia however HCT drop 31-23 with IVF overnight - received 1 U PRBC
   this am
   - Continue volume repletion - consider albumin/IVF vs PRBC given low
   albumin. Currently with good urine output 65ml/hr if drops will add
   pressors
   - STAT HCT now
   - Will check cortisol and [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim if low

   # Confusion: Likely multifactorial encephalopathy. Pt with evidence of
   infection with UTI, poor nutritional status with albumin 1.6, metabolic
   derrangement including low Ca and Mg, anemia, dehydration and question
   of underlying liver disease vs poor nutrition with evidence of poor
   synthetic function. TSH low but likely due to chronic illness - normal
   free T4. Also history of keppra for seizure - not currently on med as
   outpatient. Serum tox explained by cyclobenazaprine which can cause
   false positives as pt otherwise does not appear to have TCA toxicity.
   Head CT negative.
   - Hold all sedating medications
   - Treat hypotension as above
   - Correct metabolic derrangements by repleting Mg and Ca
   - Consider lactulose if RUQ shows evidence of cirrhosis

","The patient is a 56-year-old female who presents with confusion and hypotension after experiencing a fall. She has been admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite intravenous fluid resuscitation. The patient's baseline blood pressure is unclear due to prior hospitalizations, but her boyfriend reports it to be in the range of 80s-90s. She has not shown any volume responsiveness, and her lactate levels are normal. The differential diagnosis includes infection with urinary tract infection (UTI), underlying toxicity from medications such as cyclobenzaprine or atenolol, but her heart rate is stable at 70-80 beats per minute, suggesting that cardiac or obstructive causes are less likely.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.7°F), a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/65 mmHg to 63/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and her physical examination reveals pale conjunctiva, ecchymosis on the head, poor dentition, cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, normal cardiovascular examination, clear breath sounds bilaterally, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present and tender liver, muscle wasting, warm skin, and normal strength with tremor.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with frequent falls who presented with confusion and hypotension after a recent fall. She has been transferred to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite IV fluid resuscitation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/60 mmHg to 97/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, ecchymosis on the forehead, poor dentition, bibasilar rales extending halfway up the chest, and a warm, dry skin. Neurologic examination shows an odd affect, though the patient is awake, alert, and cooperative. There is slight asymmetry to the face, but equal smile, eyebrow raise, tongue movements, shoulder shrug, and finger-to-nose intact. Strength is 4-1 bilaterally upper and lower, with weakness in dorsiflexion of the left foot.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated leukocyte count of 17,000/uL, a decreased hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, increased creatinine level of 1.13 mg/dL, decreased magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of frequent falls, confusion, and hypotension following a recent fall. She was transferred to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite intravenous fluid resuscitation. The patient has not been volume responsive, with normal lactate levels. Her nutritional status is poor, with an albumin level of 1.6 g/dL. She also has chronic anemia but experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration overnight after receiving packed red blood cells (PRBCs), which did not improve her mental status. The patient's cortisol level is within normal range, and she has a history of hypothyroidism, for which she is receiving levothyroxine replacement therapy.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension and mental status change: The patient's persistent hypotension and mental status changes require further evaluation. She does not appear to be infected or septic, and her lactate levels are normal. Possible causes may include medication effects, poor nutrition, or an underlying medical condition such as adrenal insufficiency.
2. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) as indicated by positive urine culture results. Antibiotic therapy with Zosyn has been initiated, and blood cultures are pending.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia has been stable, and she has received a blood transfusion. Serial hematocrit (Hct) measurements and guaiac stool"

   # Dispo -
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with frequent falls who presented with confusion and hypotension after a recent fall. She was transferred to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite intravenous fluid resuscitation. The patient's baseline condition is unclear due to prior hospitalizations, but her boyfriend reports a baseline blood pressure in the 80s-90s range. She has not been volume responsive, with a normal lactate level, suggesting that her hypotension may not be due to sepsis or infection. The patient also has very poor nutrition, as indicated by an albumin level of 1.6. Her cortisol level is low, and she has chronic anemia. Despite receiving one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), there was no improvement in her mental status. Her random cortisol level from 2018 is 1.2. The patient's [Last Name] stim is normal.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg. The patient has received a total of 5,908 mL of intravenous fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 654 mL of urine and 175 mL of blood products. Her blood cultures were drawn, and she is being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.7, a hematocrit (Hct) of 26.9, a platelet count of 70,000/mm^3, a creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7, and a troponin-T level of <0.01. Other lab values include a TCO2 of 22, a glucose level of 142, and an lactic acid level of 0.9 mmol/L. Her electrolytes are as follows: sodium (Na+) at 113 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 3.6 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 21 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) at 7.3 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) at 1.7 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) at 3.3 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include addressing her hypotension and mental status change, ruling out infection or sepsis. Medication effects should be resolving by now, and she is being monitored for volume repletion, considering albumin/IVF vs PRBCs given her low albumin. The patient's cortisol and [Last Name] stim will be checked if low. Medications including atenolol, cyclobenzaprine, and ativan have been held. The patient's ABG and lactate levels will be monitored, and she will continue on Zosyn while awaiting urine culture results. Lactulose has also been administered.

Other plans include ruling out cirrhosis with a RUQ ultrasound, obtaining a neuro consult regarding further evaluation of mental status change, and holding medications including atenolol, cyclobenzaprine, and ativan. The patient's seizure disorder will be evaluated by a neuro consult, as she is not currently on keppra. Calcium and magnesium levels will be monitored, and calcium will be given as a sliding scale. The patient's history of hypothyroidism will be managed with thyroid replacement, and her transaminitis will be trended. She will also receive nutrition support and repletion of electrolytes as needed."
