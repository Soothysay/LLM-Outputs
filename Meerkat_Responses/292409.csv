","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD on HD), and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. He presented with hematemesis and hematochezia, and was transferred from another hospital with a suspected lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been experiencing vomiting, bloody mucus coughing, some diarrhea, and a sensation of stomach fullness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient's symptoms of vomiting bloody mucus suggest an upper GI bleed, which may be due to his history of diverticulosis and prior rectal bleeding. He has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is awaiting further evaluation by gastrointestinal (GI) consultation. An upper endoscopy is planned for this morning after dialysis.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) indicates leukocytosis, which could be due to infection. However, there are no fevers, chills, or localized signs of infection. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and urine culture have been ordered to rule out infection.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient's missed hemodialysis session and elevated potassium level of 6.0 require immediate attention. He will have hemodialysis this morning and medications will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and a recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient was transferred from another hospital with ongoing lower GI bleeding. The patient's current condition includes upper GI bleed, blood loss anemia, leukocytosis, chronic renal insufficiency/HD, and bullous pemphigoid. The patient is critically ill and currently receiving hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has ongoing upper GI bleeding, which can lead to further blood loss and potential hypotension or shock if not managed promptly.
2. Chronic renal insufficiency/HD: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis. Any complications with the dialysis process could worsen the patient's renal function and overall condition.
3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection. If untreated, it could progress to sepsis, leading to organ dysfunction.
4. Bullous pemphigoid: This is a skin condition that can cause blisters and increased risk of infection. Proper management is essential to prevent complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating potential hypotension. This can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of multiple"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He was transferred from an outside hospital with the lower GI bleed. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to aspiration during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). He has received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is hemodynamically stable. The EGD did not reveal any active bleeding sites, but there was evidence of blood in the stomach and clot in the duodenum. Surgery consulted for evaluation of possible aortoenteric fistula, but a CT abdomen with contrast showed no evidence of such fistula or acute intrabdominal process. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, but trending down, with no clear source of infection. He has a history of bullous pemphigoid, for which he is on prednisone taper. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his lab results are within normal limits except for minimally elevated lipase levels. The patient's family has noted a recent history of mouth/throat cancer. The patient's DNR/DNI status is discussed if he would be intubated for a long time.

   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Definitive management depends on endoscope.
   Leukocytosis
   White count trending down. No clear source of infection. Abd CT without
   intra abdominal process. Afebrile. C. Diff Negative.
   - Stop Cipro/Flagyl
   - Culture if spikes
   - FU blood cultures
   ESRD on HD
   Renal planning for HD tomorrow.
   - Will discuss with Renal possibility of HD today to take off some
   volume prior to extubation.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   CAD
   Stable
   - Hold ASA, BB in the setting of GI bleed
   - Continue statin
   Back and hip pain
   - Continue tramadol, oxazepam as BP tolerates.
   Bullous pemphigoid
   Stable. Patient on prednisone taper. Will continue taper after acute
   episode resolves. Continuing stress dose steroids currently. Follow up
   with Dermatology at discharge.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old male with a history of CAD (S/P CABG), ESRD on HD, AAA s/p
   repair, who was transferred from OSH with lower GI bleed.
   GI Bleed
   Thought to be lower initially with NG lavage negative and [**Last Name (un) 890**]. No
   BRBPR. Patient has a history of diverticulosis, and prior rectal
   bleeding. Received 1u PRBCs today. Now this a.m. with frank bloody
   mucus being spat up (most likely upper GI but possible lung and
   swallowing -> [**Last Name (un) 890**].
   - Given 7 units
 still waiting for final crit.
   - GI consulted
 will take for upper endoscope this a.m. (after
   diadlysis), f/u recs
   - IV fluid boluses to keep MAP>65
   - Q6h HCT -transfuse for HCT<30
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Definitive management depends on endoscope.
   Leukocytosis
   WBC 27.3, though 19.3 two hours prior. Differential includes infection,
   steroids (less likely), C. diff. given diarrhea. No fevers, chills, or
   localizing source of infection. CXR without obvious infiltrate.
   - Obtain blood cultures, UA, Urine culture
   - Await C. diff.
   ESRD on HD
   Missed HD today. K of 6.0.
   - Will have HD this a.m.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   Nausea
   Likely secondary to blood products in stomach. Zofran not very
   effective.
   - Continue Zofran
   - Considered ativan but did not want to increase aspiration risk
   CAD
   Stable
   - Hold ASA, BB in the setting of GI bleed
   - Continue statin
   Back and hip pain
   - Continue tramadol, oxazepam as BP tolerates.
   Bullous pemphigoid
   Stable. Patient on prednisone taper. Would consider speaking with
   outpatient dermatologist regarding prednisone given GI bleeds in this
   setting.
   Access
   Given WBC, low threshold to remove femoral line.
   - If blood culture positive of if spikes then remove
   - Establish better access ASAP and remove femoral
   - Consider PICC and/or good PIV later today when able to prognosticate
   about further bleeding

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and diverticulosis. He was transferred to the ICU for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, initially thought to be lower GI bleed. He has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is awaiting further critical values. 

The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to the risk of aspiration during the endoscopic procedure. Blood products have been given, but the patient continues to have bloody mucus being spat up, indicating ongoing bleeding. 

He has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 27.3, which could be due to infection or stress. No source of infection is evident, but blood cultures and urine cultures have been obtained. C. difficile infection has been ruled out. 

The patient missed his scheduled hemodialysis session today, leading to a potassium level of 6.0. He will receive hemodialysis this morning and renal dose medications will be adjusted accordingly. 

The patient's nausea is likely secondary to blood products in the stomach. Zofran has been continued, and consideration has been given to using Ativan but was not pursued due to increased aspiration risk. 

The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, and he is on appropriate medications for his condition. 

The patient is also experiencing back and hip pain, for which"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He was admitted to the ICU due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently experiencing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) yesterday, which revealed a large clot at the stomach fundus that could not be removed. A repeat EGD was performed today. The patient is intubated for airway protection and remains intubated overnight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/35-150/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's blood hemoglobin level is low at 11.1 g/dL, indicating ongoing blood loss and anemia.

The patient has a history of allergies to various pain medications and antibiotics. He is currently receiving sedation and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,759 mL, including 795 mL of intravenous fluids, and an output of 300 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows no acute abdominal process."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (AAA repair). The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and renal failure. The respiratory failure is not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but rather acute respiratory failure. The impaired skin integrity may be due to bullous pemphigoid, which the patient has been diagnosed with. The renal failure is end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the patient is on hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 138/46 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and conversational.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The kidney function tests indicate renal dysfunction.

The patient's imaging studies reveal no evidence of aortoenteric fistulization, mild stranding between the aorta and graft, and duodenum consistent with postoperative changes. The abdominal bruit is present and most audible"

   82 year old male with a history of CAD (S/P CABG), ESRD on HD, AAA s/p
   repair, who was transferred from OSH with lower GI bleed.
   GI Bleed
   Hemodynamically stable. HCT relatively stable sp 7 Units PRBCs.
   - GI to repeat EGD today.
   - Q8H hematocrits
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Definitive management depends on endoscope.
   Leukocytosis
   White count trending down. No clear source of infection. Abd CT without
   intra abdominal process. Afebrile. C. Diff Negative. Cipro/Flagyl
   stopped yesterday.
   - Culture if spikes
   - FU blood cultures
   ESRD on HD
   Renal planning for HD today.
   - Will discuss with Renal possibility of HD today to take off some
   volume prior to extubation.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   Ventilation
   Failed SBTs x 2 yesterday. Likely [**12-30**] fluid overload in context of
   transfusions.
   - D/w Renal for aggressive goal for fluid off.
   - Attempt SBT again after dialysis
   - Extubate if passed SBT
   CAD
   Stable
   - Hold ASA, BB in the setting of GI bleed
   - Continue statin
   Back and hip pain
   - Continue tramadol, oxazepam as BP tolerates.
   Bullous pemphigoid
   Stable. Patient on prednisone taper. Will continue taper after acute
   episode resolves. Continuing stress dose steroids yesterday. Follow up
   with Dermatology at discharge.
   - Resume taper

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 

The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, renal failure, and upper GI bleeding. He has been receiving hemodynamic support with intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory system compliance of 45 cmH2O/mL. His oxygenation is adequate with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 468. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and the need for hemodialysis. 

The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, but there is no clear source of infection. He has received antibiotics, and cultures have been obtained. 

The patient's fluid status is a concern, as he has failed two spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) likely due to fluid overload. 

The patient's history of CAD is stable, and he is currently on medication to manage his condition. 

The patient also has bullous pemphigoid, a skin condition, which is being managed with"

   Chief Complaint: GI Bleed
   24 Hour Events:
   - HD in a.m. with pressure dropping to 80s - stopped taking volume off.
   - Renal recs enacted: increased sevelamer to 1600 mg TID; EPO at HD;
   3.5 hours HD with goal of 3 L off (not acheived, as above).
   - Decreased steroids: Hydrocort from 50 mg q6 IV to 25 q8 IV, then
   prednisone 10 mg  on [**12-19**] (not yet ordered) (back to taper of one month
   at 10 mg then one month at 5 mg)
   - Vascular dropped note: S/p CT, no concern at present for fistula s/p
   AAA repair.
   - EGD in afternoon with propofol and small amount of pressor.
   - Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus. Stomach: Mucosa: In the
   fundus, a small serpigenous ulcer was noted surrounded by an area of
   erythema.  Two cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at
   the stomach fundus. Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
   Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy)
   Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
   Recommendations: Continue high dose ppi
   Await biopsy reports. Patient will need outpatient GI follow up after
   discharge.
   - SBT passed well with slightly alkalotic gas and low CO2 - possibly
   secondary to anxiety. RSBI was 18.
   - Extubated successfully.
   - Restarted full liquids with advance to clears as tolerated.
   - Renal recommended Midedrine prior to dialysis on Saturday morning (5
   mg PO) to help preserve pressure with negative volume goal.
   - Hematocrit trended down: 37.5 > 34.5 > 33.1 (not dilutional - need to
   entertain possibility of further bleeding)

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair who presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been hemodynamically stable with a relatively stable hematocrit level after receiving 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). An ulcer has been identified in the stomach.

The assessment and plan include:
1. GI bleed: The patient is stable, and further management depends on the findings of the endoscopy. Biopsies have been performed, and high-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are being continued. Definitive management will depend on the results of the endoscopy.
2. ESRD on HD/Volume status: The patient is volume overloaded, and renal planning for HD tomorrow includes giving 5 mg of Midodrine prior to hemodialysis to support blood pressure and remove excess volume. Renally dosed medications will be avoided, and nephrotoxins will be avoided as well.
3. CAD: The patient's cardiac condition is stable, and medications such as aspirin and beta-blockers will be restarted in the next few days pending stable blood pressure and hematocrit levels.
4. Back and hip pain: The patient's pain is being managed with tramadol and oxazepam as tolerated.
5. Bullous pemphigoid: The patient's skin condition is stable, and prednisone taper will continue. Follow-up with dermatology at discharge is planned.
6. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and PPI prophylaxis are being continued.
7. Access: Arterial line and PICC line are in place.
8. Communication: Contact information for the patient's daughter and healthcare providers is provided.
9. Code status: Full code.
10. Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU until clinical improvement is observed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Further bleeding from the identified ulcer or other sources.
2. Hypotension and unstable blood pressure due to fluid overload and ongoing bleeding.
3. Renal complications due to volume overload and ongoing hemodialysis.
4. Cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
5. Infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Development of pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization.
8. Gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration pneumonia or stress ulcers.
9. Cognitive changes or delirium due to medications or underlying conditions.

   Chief Complaint: GI Bleed
   24 Hour Events:
   - HD in a.m. with pressure dropping to 80s - stopped taking volume off.
   - Renal recs enacted: increased sevelamer to 1600 mg TID; EPO at HD;
   3.5 hours HD with goal of 3 L off (not acheived, as above).
   - Decreased steroids: Hydrocort from 50 mg q6 IV to 25 q8 IV, then
   prednisone 10 mg  on [**12-19**] (not yet ordered) (back to taper of one month
   at 10 mg then one month at 5 mg)
   - Vascular dropped note: S/p CT, no concern at present for fistula s/p
   AAA repair.
   - EGD in afternoon with propofol and small amount of pressor.
   - Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus. Stomach: Mucosa: In the
   fundus, a small serpigenous ulcer was noted surrounded by an area of
   erythema.  Two cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at
   the stomach fundus. Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
   Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy)
   Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
   Recommendations: Continue high dose ppi
   Await biopsy reports. Patient will need outpatient GI follow up after
   discharge.
   - SBT passed well with slightly alkalotic gas and low CO2 - possibly
   secondary to anxiety. RSBI was 18.
   - Extubated successfully.
   - Restarted full liquids with advance to clears as tolerated.
   - Renal recommended Midedrine prior to dialysis on Saturday morning (5
   mg PO) to help preserve pressure with negative volume goal.
   - Hematocrit trended down: 37.5 > 34.5 > 33.1 (not dilutional - need to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (S/P CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is hemodynamically stable. He has received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient presented with a lower GI bleed. Further evaluation through an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned to determine the source and extent of the bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic stability, and hematocrit levels is necessary. If the bleeding recurs or is significant, additional blood transfusions may be required.
2. ESRD on HD: The patient has ESRD and is on maintenance HD. Renal planning for HD today is mentioned, indicating the need for ongoing management of renal function and fluid balance. It is important to avoid fluid overload, especially considering the recent fluid overload in the context of transfusions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He was transferred to the ICU for lower gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient has several medical conditions including respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and upper gastrointestinal bleed. The respiratory failure is not acute and the patient was extubated yesterday. Impaired skin integrity is mentioned but no further details are provided. The upper gastrointestinal bleed has stopped and the patient is awaiting further evaluation of the stomach biopsies.

The patient is on hemodialysis for chronic renal insufficiency and is also being treated for bullous pemphigoid with a reduced dose of prednisone. There is mention of left arm swelling but no specific cause or treatment is indicated. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or respiratory distress syndrome.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and compromised wound healing.

3. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed: Although the bleeding has stopped, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or complications related to the underlying cause of the bleed, such as peptic ulcer disease or gastritis.

4. Chronic Renal Ins"
