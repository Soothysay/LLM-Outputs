","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU. They experienced several episodes of low-grade fever, hypotension, and hypokalemia, which were managed accordingly. The patient's mental status was altered, and they were started on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's blood work showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. Liver enzymes were slightly elevated, with an increased PT/PTT and INR. Electrolyte levels were abnormal, including low potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. The patient received various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, IV fluids, and medication adjustments. They continue to be monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could progress if they do not improve or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and altered mental status raises concerns for possible infections. The patient may be at risk for further infections while in the ICU.
3. Hypotension: If the patient's blood pressure continues to be unstable, it could lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
4. Hypokalemia: Low potassium levels can affect cardiac function and muscle weakness. If not corrected, it may lead to severe complications.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's"

   with seizure and LP c/w meningitis vs encephalitis.
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: thus far seems most c/w viral meningitis
   given lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from
   OSH.  HSV encephalitis is also on ddx at this time pending further data
   from CSF PCR and planned MRI imaging.  No focal neurologic defecits on
   exam at this time.
   -f/u ID reccs
   -f/u gram stain/culture from [**Location (un) **]
   -continue vanc/ceftriaxone/acyclovir for now
   -start ampicillin to cover for listeria
   -?doxycycline
   -will need MRI to evaluate for temporal lobe edema/enhancing lesion to
   further eval for evidence of HSV encephalitis; may require intubation
   to allow for MRI given AMS
   -blood cx, cxr, UA C&S to evaluate for other possible sources of
   infection
   .
   #Seizure - tonic clonic per report likely [**3-15**] meningitis vs
   encephalitis as above.  Treated with ativan/dilatin at OSH with no
   obvious seizure activity since arrival here although persistant AMS
   possibly [**3-15**] subclinical seizure vs infection.
   -f/u neurology reccs
   -continue dilantin, disscuss w/neuro the appropriate dose
   -EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   .
   #Anemia - concerning for blood loss as HCT at OSH 36.3 -> 28.8 on
   arrival here.  Also got about 4L IVF so may be hemodilutional.
   -guaiac stools
   -follow serial HCT's to be sure stable
   .
   #Mild Transaminitis - likely [**3-15**] seizure, not concerning at this time
   for viral hepatitis as primary cause, trending down c/w OSH.
   -daily LFT's
   .
   #Non-Gap metabolic acidosis - likely [**3-15**] agressive IVF with NS prior to

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizure and lumbar puncture, presenting with symptoms of fever, hypotension, and hypokalemia.
- She was admitted to the ICU with a possible diagnosis of meningitis or encephalitis, with initial findings suggesting viral meningitis.
- Further tests are being conducted to rule out other potential causes, including HSV encephalitis.
- The patient has been started on antibiotics, antivirals, and additional medications to cover for possible infections.
- She is currently experiencing intermittent agitation, stating she needs to use the bathroom, with no focal neurological deficits observed.
- Her vital signs show a low-grade temperature, tachycardia, and low blood pressure.
- Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient is also showing signs of a non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to aggressive intravenous fluid administration.
- Anemia and mild transaminitis are also noted, with further evaluation recommended.
- The patient's condition remains unstable, and she may require intubation for an upcoming MRI to evaluate for temporal lobe edema/enhancing lesion suggestive of HSV encephalitis.
- Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening infection, seizures, bleeding, and metabolic disturbances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening infection: The patient is being treated for suspected meningitis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 41-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningitis versus encephalitis. She has been treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and has shown improvement, but still exhibits altered mental status (AMS) and abnormal neurologic findings. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/63 mmHg to 142/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. Arterial blood gas analysis shows normal pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and bicarbonate levels. 

Plan:

1. Continue with current ID recs, including viral panel, HIV test, and outside hospital follow-up.
2. Follow up on gram stain/culture from an unspecified location.
3. Maintain vanc/ceftriaxone/acyclovir therapy for now.
4. Start ampicillin to cover for listeria.
5. Consider doxycycline.
6. Plan for MRI imaging to evaluate for temporal lobe edema/enhancing lesion and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presented with a seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningitis versus encephalitis. The initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed lymphocyte predominance, normal protein/glucose levels, and negative Gram stain. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for CSF are pending. The patient has been empirically treated for both bacterial and viral meningitis, as well as mycoplasma infection. An MRI has been ordered to evaluate for temporal lobe edema/enhancing lesion and further assess for evidence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis vs Encephalitis: The patient may develop complications associated with either meningitis or encephalitis, such as neurological deficits, seizures, or respiratory failure due to compromised brain function.
2. HSV Encephalitis: If the patient is diagnosed with HSV encephalitis, she may experience severe neurological complications, including focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, and potential progression to coma.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient may continue to experience seizures, which could lead to further neurological complications and require ongoing management with antiepileptic drugs.
4. Non-Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis, which could progress if not appropriately managed with IV fluids.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU with new onset seizures and presenting with a post-ictal state. She exhibits mild improvement in mental status but remains significantly confused. The patient has hyper-reflexia in her lower extremities (LEs) with no fractures or cord compression noted on CT.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/56 mmHg to 142/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium, dilantin, and other ICU medications.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and increased platelet count. Blood cultures were taken at different times, and urine culture was also obtained. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but liver enzymes are elevated.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of seizures with dilantin, EEG monitoring, neurology input, and clarification of dosing based on dilantin levels. Possible meningitis is suspected, and cultures are pending. Acyclovir has been started for possible HSV infection, and CMV load will be checked. Antibiotics (vancomycin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone) are being administered for possible bacterial mening"

- The patient is a 41-year-old female with a chief complaint of seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) consistent with meningitis vs encephalitis.
- The patient was transferred from another hospital with seizure activity and subsequent LP showing signs of meningitis or encephalitis.
- The initial CSF analysis showed a lymphocyte predominance, normal protein/glucose levels, and no organisms seen on Gram stain, suggesting viral meningitis.
- However, HSV encephalitis is also being considered pending further CSF PCR results and planned MRI imaging.
- The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and coverage for mycoplasma.
- The patient has no significant past medical history.
- Physical examination findings include lethargy, normal temperature, elevated blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.
- Neurological examination reveals intermittent sleeping, occasionally opening eyes to voice, not reliably following commands, 3+ symmetric reflexes in upper and lower extremities, clonus in feet bilaterally, and decreased from yesterday, and clonus in right hand but not left. Withdraws to painful stimulus.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient's condition remains stable with ongoing monitoring for potential complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, seizures, anemia,"

The patient was transferred from another hospital with initial results showing lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A Gram-stain from an unspecified location showed no organisms, and PCR tests were negative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and enterovirus. However, herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is still being considered pending further data from CSF PCR and MRI imaging.

The patient is currently receiving broad coverage for both bacterial and viral meningitis, as well as mycoplasma with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, doxycycline, and acyclovir. An MRI was performed earlier in the morning, but the final read is pending. The patient's blood culture is still pending, and additional tests have been ordered to cover other possible causes such as toxoplasmosis, Lyme disease, Bartonella infection, and cytomegalovirus (CMV).

The patient also experienced a seizure, which was treated with ativan and dilantin at the previous hospital. Although no obvious seizure activity has been observed since arrival, persistent altered mental status could indicate subclinical seizure activity.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture showing signs of meningitis or encephalitis. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medications. The initial CSF analysis showed a lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose levels, suggesting a viral etiology. The G-stain from the CSF was negative for organisms, and PCR tests for EBV and enterovirus were also negative. However, further testing is pending to rule out HSV encephalitis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 113/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals lethargy, clonus in the right hand and bilateral feet, and intermittent opening of eyes to voice with no reliable following of commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. The patient has slightly elevated blood glucose levels and abnormal liver function tests. The electrolyte levels are within normal range, but there is a mild metabolic acidosis.

The patient's medical history is significant for possible aspiration pneumonia, for which she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other potential causes of her symptoms, such as toxoplasmosis, Lyme disease, Bartonella infection, my"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo female admitted to ICU following seizure--new onset and
   generalized tonic/clonic seizure activity.  She has a suggestion of
   viral infection with diffuse changes on laboratory pannels and has
   findings on preliminary MRI review to suggest meningitis.  She has been
   covered with Acyclovir since presentation and full viral pannel has
   been sent in concert with the ID consultants to look for any possible,
   identifiable source.  Of concern is recurrent fever which in the
   setting of persistent altered mental status is concerning for
   aspiration penumonitis without evidence to date of evolution of
   aspiration pneumonia.
   1)Seizure--working diagnosis is new onset seizure in the setting of
   viral meningitis but the final diagnosis has yet to be established
   -Continue with Dilantin and dose by level-_Dila
   -Will follow up on MRI [**Location (un) **]
   -Follow up on all CSF testing at [**Location (un) **]
   -Will treat for meningitis as defined below
   2)Meningitis
presumptive diagnosis
   -Amp/Doxycycline/Vanco/CTX/Acyclovir to cover
   -Will look to CMV testing for guidance on the choice of anti-virals
   3)Fever

   -This is likely related
   -Elevate HOB
   -If possible, will move to D/C C-collar

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU following a seizure. She experienced new-onset generalized tonic/clonic seizure activity and had a suggestion of viral infection with diffuse changes on laboratory panels. The preliminary MRI review also suggested meningitis. The patient has been covered with Acyclovir since presentation, and a full viral panel has been sent to identify any possible source.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningitis vs encephalitis.  No clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be declining.  Neurologic exam
   otherwise unchanged.  No clear organism.
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: thus far seems most c/w viral meningitis
   given lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from
   OSH.  G-stain from [**Location (un) **] shows no organisms, only polys and PCR
   negative for EBV and enterovirus.  HSV encephalitis is also on ddx at
   this time pending further data from CSF PCR and MRI imaging.  No focal
   neurologic defecits on exam at this time.  Currently covered broadly
   for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma with
   Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, Doxycyclin, and Acyclovir.  MRI
   was performed yesterday, preliminary read shows increased signal in
   sulci, ?SAH.  LP and CT scan do not show evidence of SAH.
   - f/u lab results from [**Location (un) **]
        - per [**Location (un) **], pending CSF studies are parvovirus B19, HSV VZV and
   final cultures
        - as of [**2122-1-1**], CSF culture data is no growth to date
        - CSF at [**Location (un) **] NOT sent for EEE, WNV, CMV because they have no
   more CSF to send
   - will repeat LP today for opening pressure, gram stain and culture,
   CMV, EBV, enterovirus, HSV, VZV, EEE, WNV, parvovirus
   - blood and urine cultures still negative
   - labs for other possible causes: toxo, lyme, bartonella, mycoplasma,
   CMV, LCMV ordered

   possibly [**3-15**] subclinical seizure vs infection.  CT scan reassuring for
   no c-spine fracture or cord compression.  Discussed with EEG attending
   yesterday and no evidence of seizures on EEG monitoring from [**12-30**] or
   am of [**12-31**].  Discussed with neuro and need to resume continuous EEG
   monitoring given that patient still has persistent AMS.
   -f/u neurology recs

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU with seizures and lumbar puncture (LP) indicating meningitis versus encephalitis.
- There is no clear improvement, and mental status appears to be declining.
- Neurologic exam remains unchanged.
- No clear organism has been identified, but viral meningitis seems more likely due to lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose levels in the CSF.
- The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and likely has aspiration pneumonitis.
- She is being covered broadly for both bacterial and viral meningitis, as well as mycoplasma with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, Doxycycline, and Acyclovir.
- An MRI shows increased signal in sulci, possibly suggesting subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but LP and CT scan do not show evidence of SAH.
- Blood and urine cultures are negative, and CSF culture data shows no growth to date.
- The patient will undergo a repeat LP today for opening pressure, gram stain, and culture, as well as testing for CMV, EBV, enterovirus, HSV, VZV, EEE, WNV, and parvovirus.
- Other possible causes such as toxoplasmos"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 41-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) indicating meningitis versus encephalitis.
- The patient's condition seems consistent with viral meningitis due to the lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose levels in the CSF.
- G-stain from an unidentified location showed no organisms, while PCR was negative for EBV and enterovirus. HSV encephalitis is still being considered pending further data from CSF PCR and MRI imaging.
- The patient is being covered broadly for bacterial and viral meningitis, as well as mycoplasma, with antibiotics and acyclovir.
- An MRI was performed, but the final read is pending.
- The patient experienced a tonic-clonic seizure and is currently on ativan/dilantin treatment. Continuous EEG monitoring is being resumed due to persistent altered mental status (AMS).
- The patient had episodes of gagging on secretions, leading to a suspicion of aspiration. Broad coverage for aspiration pneumonia is being provided.
- The patient's anemia is stable and likely due to hemodilutional causes. Monitoring will continue.
- There is mild transaminitis, which could be related to viral infection or seizures. Daily LFTs will be monitored, along with CMV viral load, EBV Ab panel, HCV Ab, and HBV Abs.
- The patient has a non-gap metabolic"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningitis vs encephalitis.  No clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be declining.  Neurologic exam
   otherwise unchanged.  No clear organism.
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: thus far seems most c/w viral meningitis
   given lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from
   OSH.  G-stain from [**Location (un) **] shows no organisms, only polys and PCR
   negative for EBV and enterovirus.  HSV encephalitis is also on ddx at
   this time pending further data from CSF PCR and MRI imaging.  No focal
   neurologic defecits on exam at this time.  Currently covered broadly
   for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma with
   Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, Doxycyclin, and Acyclovir.  MRI
   was performed yesterday, preliminary read shows increased signal in
   sulci, ?SAH.  LP and CT scan do not show evidence of SAH.
   - f/u lab results from [**Location (un) **]
        - per [**Location (un) **], pending CSF studies are parvovirus B19, HSV VZV and
   final cultures
        - as of [**2122-1-1**], CSF culture data is no growth to date
        - CSF at [**Location (un) **] NOT sent for EEE, WNV, CMV because they have no
   more CSF to send
   - will repeat LP today for opening pressure, gram stain and culture,
   CMV, EBV, enterovirus, HSV, VZV, EEE, WNV, parvovirus
   - blood and urine cultures still negative
   - labs for other possible causes: toxo, lyme, bartonella, mycoplasma,
   CMV, LCMV ordered
   .
   #Seizure - tonic clonic per report likely [**3-15**] meningitis vs
   encephalitis as above.  Treated with ativan/dilatin at OSH with no
   obvious seizure activity since arrival here although persistant AMS
   possibly [**3-15**] subclinical seizure vs infection.  CT scan reassuring for
   no c-spine fracture or cord compression.  Discussed with EEG attending
   yesterday and no evidence of seizures on EEG monitoring from [**12-30**] or
   am of [**12-31**].  Discussed with neuro and need to resume continuous EEG
   monitoring given that patient still has persistent AMS.
   -f/u neurology recs
   -continue Keppra (changed from Dilantin on [**2122-1-1**])
   -continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   - minimal sedation to monitor frequent neuro checks
   .
   # Aspiration Pneumonitis
  Now intubated for airway protection.
   Likely aspiration pneumonitis given improvement on CXR today.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated
   - minimal sedation to assess neuron status
   - continue current antibiotic coverage
   #MRI findings
 enhancement of sulci with ?SAH.  Not seen on CT or LP
   results.  Low likelihood of SAH given CT and LP results.  Will
   follow-up final read.
   .
   #Mild Transaminitis
 Stable today, likely [**3-15**] seizure, though could be
   related to viral infection.  Hepatitis panel shows prior immunization.
   Pt currently on Tylenol.
   - will try Ibuprofen before Tylenol to manage fevers
   -daily LFT's
   -f/u CMV viral load, EBV Ab panel

","The patient is a 41-year-old female with a chief complaint of seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) showing meningitis versus encephalitis. The patient was transferred from another hospital with no significant past medical history. The patient's mental status appears to be declining, and there are no clear signs of improvement. The neurologic exam remains unchanged, and no clear organism has been identified.

Based on the information provided, the possible medical complications that can arise include:

1. Meningitis vs Encephalitis: The patient's symptoms are consistent with either viral meningitis or encephalitis. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's mental status and neurologic exam for any changes.

2. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to suspected aspiration pneumonitis. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary, and weaning of ventilation settings should be done as tolerated.

3. Subclinical Seizures: The patient had a tonic-clonic seizure reported, and there is a possibility of ongoing subclinical seizures. Continuous EEG monitoring has been recommended to evaluate for subclinical seizures.

4. SAH (Subarachnoid Hemorrhage): The MRI findings show increased signal in sulci, which raises suspicion of SAH. However, the CT scan and LP results do not show evidence of SAH. Further follow-up is needed to confirm or rule out SAH.

5. Mild Transam"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningitis vs encephalitis.  No clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be declining.  Neurologic exam
   otherwise unchanged.  No clear organism.
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: thus far seems most c/w viral meningitis
   given lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from
   OSH.  G-stain from [**Location (un) **] shows no organisms, only polys and PCR
   negative for EBV and enterovirus.  HSV encephalitis is also on ddx at
   this time pending further data from CSF PCR and MRI imaging.  No focal
   neurologic defecits on exam at this time.  Currently covered broadly
   for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma with
   Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, Doxycyclin, and Acyclovir.  MRI
   was performed yesterday, preliminary read shows increased signal in
   sulci, ?SAH.  LP and CT scan do not show evidence of SAH.
   - f/u lab results from [**Location (un) **]
        - per [**Location (un) **], pending CSF studies are parvovirus B19, HSV VZV and
   final cultures
        - as of [**2122-1-1**], CSF culture data is no growth to date
        - CSF at [**Location (un) **] NOT sent for EEE, WNV, CMV because they have no
   more CSF to send
   - will repeat LP today for opening pressure, gram stain and culture,
   CMV, EBV, enterovirus, HSV, VZV, EEE, WNV, parvovirus
   - blood and urine cultures still negative
   - labs for other possible causes: toxo, lyme, bartonella, mycoplasma,
   CMV, LCMV ordered
   .
   #Seizure - tonic clonic per report likely [**3-15**] meningitis vs
   encephalitis as above.  Treated with ativan/dilatin at OSH with no
   obvious seizure activity since arrival here although persistant AMS
   possibly [**3-15**] subclinical seizure vs infection.  CT scan reassuring for
   no c-spine fracture or cord compression.  Discussed with EEG attending
   yesterday and no evidence of seizures on EEG monitoring from [**12-30**] or
   am of [**12-31**].  Discussed with neuro and need to resume continuous EEG
   monitoring given that patient still has persistent AMS.
   -f/u neurology recs
   -continue Keppra (changed from Dilantin on [**2122-1-1**])
   -continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   - minimal sedation to monitor frequent neuro checks
   .
   # Aspiration Pneumonitis
  Now intubated for airway protection.
   Likely aspiration pneumonitis given improvement on CXR today.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated
   - minimal sedation to assess neuron status
   - continue current antibiotic coverage
   #MRI findings
 enhancement of sulci with ?SAH.  Not seen on CT or LP
   results.  Likely abnormal.
   .
   #Mild Transaminitis
 Stable today, likely [**3-15**] seizure, though could be
   related to viral infection.
   -daily LFT's
   -CMV viral load, EBV Ab panel, HCV Ab, HBV Abs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female who was transferred to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) showing meningitis versus encephalitis. The patient's mental status appears to be declining, and no clear organism has been identified yet.

The patient has been treated broadly for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma with antibiotics and antiviral medication. An MRI was performed, which showed increased signal in the sulci, raising suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, the LP and CT scan did not show evidence of SAH.

The patient's blood and urine cultures are still negative, and further CSF studies are pending, including tests for parvovirus B19, HSV VZV, and final cultures. The attending physician plans to repeat the LP today for opening pressure, gram stain, and culture, as well as testing for CMV, EBV, enterovirus, HSV, VZV, EEE, WNV, and parvovirus.

The patient's seizure activity has been managed with ativan/dilantin, but persistent altered mental status (AMS) is possibly due to subclinical seizure activity or infection. Continuous EEG monitoring has been recommended to evaluate for subclinical seizures.

The patient is now intubated for airway protection due to aspiration pneumonitis. Ventilation settings will be weaned as tolerated, and current"

   41 yo female admitted with new onset seizures without status
   epilepticus.  She now had prolonged course to recovery of baseline
   mental function which may well represent continued insult with
   hypecarbia, mild transaminitis, possible aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia and ongoing investigations to establish trend in
   CSF changes and complete diagnostic evaluation in the setting of
   treating all possible sources.  She has provocative metabolic changes
   with hypophosphatemia and transient hypocalcemia.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Propofol
   -Change to PSV today to allow spontaneous respiration in most
   comfortable mode of support

   4)Hypocalcamia-
   -Will check albumin today
   -Have severe hypophosphatemia as well.
   -Will replete but will need to consider further evaluation in the
   setting of albumin results based upon findings.

   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningitis vs encephalitis.  No clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be stable and depressed.
   Electively intubated on [**12-31**] for airway protection and periods of
   apnea. Neurologic exam otherwise unchanged.  No clear organism.
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: thus far seems most c/w viral meningitis
   given lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from
   OSH and here.  G-stain from [**Location (un) **] shows no organisms, only polys and
   PCR negative for EBV and enterovirus.  HSV encephalitis is also on ddx
   at this time pending further data from CSF PCR and MRI imaging.  No
   focal neurologic defecits on exam at this time.  Currently covered
   broadly for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma
   with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, Doxycyclin, and Acyclovir.
   MRI shows increased signal in sulci of unclear significance.  LP and CT
   scan do not show evidence of SAH.  CSF at [**Location (un) **] NOT sent for EEE,
   WNV, CMV because they have no more CSF to send. Collected and ordered
   on CSF from [**1-1**] LP in [**Hospital1 19**] MICU.   OP on repeat LP was 29.
   - f/u lab results from [**Location (un) **]
        - per [**Location (un) **], pending CSF studies are parvovirus B19, HSV VZV and
   final cultures
        - as of [**2122-1-1**], CSF culture data is no growth to date
   - blood and urine cultures still negative
   - serum toxo, lyme, cmv negative; ebv labs show evidence of prior
   infection.
   - labs for other possible causes: bartonella, mycoplasma, LCMV, histo,
   anaplasma, erlichia, WNV, Qfever pending.
   -d/w ID to d/c vanco, possibly other abx?

   #Seizure - tonic clonic per report likely [**3-15**] meningitis vs
   encephalitis as above.  Treated with ativan/dilatin at OSH with no
   obvious seizure activity since arrival here although persistant AMS
   possibly [**3-15**] subclinical seizure vs infection.  CT scan reassuring for
   no c-spine fracture or cord compression.  Discussed with EEG attending
   yesterday and no evidence of seizures on EEG monitoring from [**12-30**] or
   am of [**12-31**].  Discussed with neuro and need to resume continuous EEG
   monitoring given that patient still has persistent AMS. Keppra
   increased to [**2113**] [**Hospital1 7**] yesterday.
   -f/u neurology recs
   -continue Keppra (changed from Dilantin on [**2122-1-1**])
   -continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   - change sedation to ativan, fentanyl, give sedation breaks to assess
   MS.

   # Aspiration Pneumonitis
  Now intubated for airway protection.
   Likely aspiration pneumonitis given improvement on CXR today.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who was transferred to the ICU with a diagnosis of meningitis versus encephalitis. She presented with seizures and a lumbar puncture (LP) that showed signs of infection in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and other supportive care. She has a history of fever, diarrhea, and mild transaminitis, but no clear improvement in mental status. Further tests are pending to identify the specific organism causing the infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient initially presented with seizures, and there is a concern for ongoing subclinical seizures, especially since the patient remains in altered mental status. Continuous EEG monitoring has been recommended to evaluate for any seizure activity.

2. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient is now intubated for airway protection due to suspected aspiration pneumonitis. Weaning of ventilator settings will be monitored closely.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient developed diarrhea, which raises concern for C. diff infection, especially given the recent antibiotic use. Further testing is pending.

4. Hepatitis: The patient has mild transaminitis, which could be related to a recent viral infection or previous hepatitis exposure. Monitoring liver function tests and checking for hepatitis panel results is advised.

The patient's mental status is declining, and there is no clear improvement or identified organism. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating an inflammatory response. The blood cultures are negative, but CSF culture is pending. The patient has been covered for various pathogens including bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma.

The patient had a seizure, which was likely related to the infection. The EEG monitoring did not show any seizure activity, but continuous EEG monitoring has been recommended due to the persistent altered mental status.

The patient also has aspiration pneumonitis, which is an inflammation of the lungs caused by aspiration of gastric contents. The patient is now intubated for airway protection, and the ventilator settings are being weaned as tolerated.

There are some concerns about subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), as shown on MRI, but it is not seen on CT scan or lumbar puncture results. The low likelihood of SAH is mentioned, and further follow-up is planned.

The patient was admitted to the ICU on [admission date] due to respiratory failure and septic shock secondary to [infection/inflammatory condition]. Since admission, the patient has been mechanically ventilated and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has developed a fever, with a maximum temperature of 102.3°F. The patient's blood pressure has been relatively stable, ranging from 106/58 mmHg to 118/69 mmHg. The patient's heart rate has been between 85-109 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate has been between 7-26 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation has remained at 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of up to 41700 cells/mm3. The patient's hemoglobin level has been around 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count has been around 170,000/mm3. Renal function tests indicate a serum creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Liver enzymes, such as ALT and AST, have been elevated at 155 and 210 U/L, respectively.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningitis vs encephalitis.  No clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be stable and depressed.
   Electively intubated on [**12-31**] for airway protection and periods of
   apnea.  No clear organism.
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: thus far seems most c/w viral meningitis
   given lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from
   OSH and here.  G-stain from [**Location (un) **] shows no organisms, only polys and
   PCR negative for EBV and enterovirus.  HSV encephalitis is also on ddx
   at this time pending further data from CSF PCR and MRI imaging.  No
   focal neurologic defecits on exam at this time.  Currently covered
   broadly for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma
   with Ampicillin, Doxycyclin, and Acyclovir.  MRI shows increased signal
   in sulci of unclear significance.  LP and CT scan do not show evidence
   of SAH.  CSF at [**Location (un) **] NOT sent for EEE, WNV, CMV because they have no
   more CSF to send. Collected and ordered on CSF from [**1-1**] LP in [**Hospital1 19**]
   MICU.   OP on repeat LP was 29.  Vanco stopped [**1-3**] and Ceftriaxone to
   stop [**1-4**] given lack of evidence for bacterial meningitis.
   - f/u lab results from [**Location (un) **]
        - per [**Location (un) **], pending CSF studies are parvovirus B19, HSV VZV and
   final cultures
        - as of [**2122-1-1**], CSF culture data is no growth to date
   - f/u ID recs
   - serum toxo, lyme, cmv negative; ebv labs show evidence of prior
   infection.
   - labs for other possible causes: bartonella, mycoplasma, LCMV, histo,
   anaplasma, erlichia, WNV, Qfever pending.
   - respiratory virus studies pending, will d/c droplet precautions if
   negative.
   .
   #Seizure - tonic clonic per report likely [**3-15**] meningitis vs
   encephalitis as above.  Treated with ativan/dilantin at OSH with no
   obvious seizure activity since arrival here although persistant AMS
   possibly [**3-15**] subclinical seizure vs infection.  CT scan reassuring for
   no c-spine fracture or cord compression.  Discussed with EEG attending
   and no evidence of seizures on EEG monitoring from [**12-30**] or am of
   [**12-31**].  Discussed with neuro and need to resume continuous EEG
   monitoring given that patient still has persistent AMS. On Keppra and
   Lyrica for seizure prophylaxis.  Has had some rhythmic muscle movements

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a primary complaint of seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningitis versus encephalitis. She has been intubated for airway protection due to suspected aspiration pneumonitis. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral therapy. She experienced a tonic-clonic seizure, which is being treated with ativan and dilantin. Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended due to persistent altered mental status. The patient's MRI shows increased signal in the sulci, but no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT or LP results. There is also evidence of mild transaminitis, likely related to seizure or viral infection. The patient is on tube feeds and has been started on heparin prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis vs Encephalitis: The patient's symptoms are consistent with both conditions. It is important to monitor for any changes in mental status, fever, headache, and neck stiffness.
2. Seizure Activity: The patient has experienced a tonic-clonic seizure, and there are concerns about possible subclinical seizure activity. Continuous EEG monitoring and appropriate seizure prophylaxis are recommended.
3. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient's intubation is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis. Monitoring of respiratory status and weaning of vent settings as tolerated should be done.
4. Clostridioides"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningitis vs encephalitis.  No clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be stable and depressed.
   Electively intubated on [**12-31**] for airway protection and periods of
   apnea. Neurologic exam otherwise unchanged.  No clear organism.
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: thus far seems most c/w viral meningitis
   given lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from
   OSH and here.  G-stain from [**Location (un) **] shows no organisms, only polys and
   PCR negative for EBV and enterovirus.  HSV encephalitis is also on ddx
   at this time pending further data from CSF PCR and MRI imaging.  No
   focal neurologic defecits on exam at this time.  Currently covered
   broadly for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma
   with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, Doxycyclin, and Acyclovir.
   MRI shows increased signal in sulci of unclear significance.  LP and CT
   scan do not show evidence of SAH.  CSF at [**Location (un) **] NOT sent for EEE,
   WNV, CMV because they have no more CSF to send. Collected and ordered
   on CSF from [**1-1**] LP in [**Hospital1 19**] MICU.   OP on repeat LP was 29.
   - f/u lab results from [**Location (un) **]
        - per [**Location (un) **], pending CSF studies are parvovirus B19, HSV VZV and
   final cultures
        - as of [**2122-1-1**], CSF culture data is no growth to date
   - blood and urine cultures still negative
   - serum toxo, lyme, cmv negative; ebv labs show evidence of prior
   infection.
   - labs for other possible causes: bartonella, mycoplasma, LCMV, histo,
   anaplasma, erlichia, WNV, Qfever pending.
   -d/w ID to d/c vanco, possibly other abx?
   -d/c droplet precautions b/c very unlikely bacterial meningitis.

   #Seizure - tonic clonic per report likely [**3-15**] meningitis vs
   encephalitis as above.  Treated with ativan/dilatin at OSH with no
   obvious seizure activity since arrival here although persistant AMS
   possibly [**3-15**] subclinical seizure vs infection.  CT scan reassuring for
   no c-spine fracture or cord compression.  Discussed with EEG attending
   yesterday and no evidence of seizures on EEG monitoring from [**12-30**] or
   am of [**12-31**].  Discussed with neuro and need to resume continuous EEG
   monitoring given that patient still has persistent AMS. Keppra
   increased to [**2113**] [**Hospital1 7**] yesterday.
   -f/u neurology recs
   -continue Keppra (changed from Dilantin on [**2122-1-1**])
   -continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   - change sedation to ativan, fentanyl, give sedation breaks to assess
   MS.

   # Aspiration Pneumonitis
  Now intubated for airway protection.
   Likely aspiration pneumonitis given improvement on CXR today.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated
   - minimal sedation to assess neuro status
   - continue current antibiotic coverage

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) showing signs consistent with meningitis vs encephalitis. The patient was transferred to the hospital and underwent elective intubation due to airway protection and periods of apnea. Neurologic exam remained unchanged, and there is no clear organism identified yet. 

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medications to cover bacterial and viral infections, including Mycoplasma. The MRI imaging showed increased signal in the sulci of unclear significance, and LP and CT scan do not show evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). 

The patient's blood and urine cultures are negative, and serum toxo, lyme, cmv tests are negative as well. However, other possible causes for the symptoms are still pending. 

The patient experienced a tonic-clonic seizure, which was treated with ativan and dilatin. Although there have been no obvious seizure activities since arrival, the patient still exhibits altered mental status (AMS), possibly due to subclinical seizures. Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended to evaluate for subclinical seizures. 

The patient also has aspiration pneumonitis, likely due to improvement on chest X-ray (CXR) today. Ventilator settings will be weaned as tolerated.

   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: thus far seems most c/w viral meningitis
   given lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from
   OSH and here.  G-stain from [**Location (un) **] shows no organisms, only polys and
   PCR negative for EBV and enterovirus.  HSV encephalitis is also on ddx
   at this time pending further data from CSF PCR and MRI imaging.  No
   focal neurologic defecits on exam at this time.  Currently covered
   broadly for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma
   with Ampicillin, Doxycyclin, and Acyclovir.  MRI shows increased signal
   in sulci of unclear significance.  LP and CT scan do not show evidence
   of SAH.  CSF at [**Location (un) **] NOT sent for EEE, WNV, CMV because they have no
   more CSF to send. Collected and ordered on CSF from [**1-1**] LP in [**Hospital1 19**]
   MICU.   OP on repeat LP was 29.  Vanco stopped [**1-3**] and Ceftriaxone to
   stop [**1-4**] given lack of evidence for bacterial meningitis.
   - f/u lab results from [**Location (un) **]
        - per [**Location (un) **], pending CSF studies are parvovirus B19, HSV VZV and

   obvious seizure activity since arrival here although persistant AMS
   possibly [**3-15**] subclinical seizure vs infection.  CT scan reassuring for
   no c-spine fracture or cord compression.  Discussed with EEG attending
   and no evidence of seizures on EEG monitoring from [**12-30**] or am of
   [**12-31**].  Discussed with neuro and need to resume continuous EEG
   monitoring given that patient still has persistent AMS. On Keppra and
   Lyrica for seizure prophylaxis.  Has had some rhythmic muscle movements
   over the last 24 hours concerning for possible focal motor seizure
   activity per neurology

   # Aspiration Pneumonitis
  Now intubated for airway protection.
   Likely aspiration pneumonitis given improvement on CXR.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) consistent with meningitis or encephalitis.
- She was transferred to the ICU for airway protection and periods of apnea.
- Initial CSF analysis showed lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose levels, suggesting viral meningitis.
- G-stain from Location (un) showed no organisms, and PCR was negative for EBV and enterovirus.
- MRI imaging revealed increased signal in sulci of unclear significance.
- The patient is currently covered broadly for bacterial and viral meningitis, as well as Mycoplasma with Ampicillin, Doxycycline, and Acyclovir.
- Recent lab results indicate positive Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody, and CSF cryptococcal antigen negative.
- The patient experienced a tonic-clonic seizure on [**3-15**] and has been treated with ativan/dilantin.
- Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended due to persistent altered mental status (AMS).
- The patient has had rhythmic muscle movements, concerning for possible focal motor seizure activity.
- She is on Keppra and Lyrica for seizure prophylaxis.
- Aspiration pneumonitis is suspected, given improvement on chest X-ray.
- The patient is intubated for airway protection and sed"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 41-year-old female who was transferred from OSH with a seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) consistent with meningitis or encephalitis.
- She has been intubated for airway protection and periods of apnea.
- The patient's mental status appears stable and depressed.
- Broad coverage for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma has been initiated with ampicillin, doxycycline, and acyclovir.
- MRI imaging shows increased signal in sulci of unclear significance.
- LP and CT scan do not show evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
- CSF at Location (un) NOT sent for EEE, WNV, CMV because they have no more CSF to send.
- Collected and ordered on CSF from Hospital1 MICU. OP on repeat LP was 29. Vanco stopped on 1-3 and Ceftriaxone stopped on 1-4 given lack of evidence for bacterial meningitis.
- Follow-up lab results from Location (un) are pending CSF studies for parvovirus B19, HSV VZV, and final cultures.
- Serum toxo, lyme, CMV negative; EBV labs show evidence of prior infection.
- Labs for other possible causes: Bartonella, Mycoplasma, LCMV, Histo, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, WNV, Q fever pending.
- Respiratory virus studies pending, will d/c droplet precautions if negative.
- The patient had a tonic-clonic seizure per report likely due to meningitis or encephalitis.
- She has been treated with ativan/dilantin at OSH with no obvious seizure activity since arrival here although persistent AMS possibly subclinical seizure vs infection.
- CT scan reassuring for no c-spine fracture or cord compression.
- Discussed with EEG attending and no evidence of seizures on EEG monitoring from 12-30 or am of 12-31.
- Discussed with neurology and need to resume continuous EEG monitoring given that the patient still has persistent AMS.
- On Keppra and Lyrica for seizure prophylaxis.
- Has had some rhythmic muscle movements over the last 24 hours concerning for possible focal motor seizure activity per neurology.
- Continue Keppra (changed from Dilantin on 1-1) & Lyrica (started 1-3).
- Continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures.
- Ativan prn for presumed focal motor seizures.
- Sedation with ativan & fentanyl, give sedation breaks to assess MS.
- Aspiration pneumonitis likely given improvement on CXR.
- Continue to monitor and wean vent settings as"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningitis vs encephalitis.  No clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be stable and depressed.
   Electively intubated on [**12-31**] for airway protection and periods of
   apnea.  No clear organism.
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: thus far seems most c/w viral meningitis
   given lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from
   OSH and here.  G-stain from [**Location (un) **] shows no organisms, only polys and
   PCR negative for EBV and enterovirus.  HSV encephalitis is also on ddx
   at this time pending further data from CSF PCR. Neuro exam inconsistent
   and difficult to assess when patient sedated.  Currently covered
   broadly for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma
   with Ampicillin, Doxycyclin, and Acyclovir.  Unlikely given 2 LPs with
   lymphocytosis and negative gram stains that patient has a bacterial
   meningitis so ABx can be scaled back.  MRI shows increased signal in
   sulci of unclear significance but c/w SAH.  LP and CT scan do not show
   evidence of SAH.  CSF at [**Location (un) **] NOT sent for EEE, WNV, CMV because
   they had no more CSF to send. Collected and ordered on CSF from [**1-1**]
   LP in [**Hospital1 19**] MICU.   OP on repeat LP was 29.  Vanco stopped [**1-3**] and
   Ceftriaxone to stop [**1-4**] given lack of evidence for bacterial
   meningitis. Ampicillin d/c today.
   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir
   - daily f/u lab results from [**Location (un) **]
        - per [**Location (un) **], pending CSF studies are parvovirus B19, HSV VZV and
   final cultures
        - as of [**2122-1-5**], CSF culture data is no growth to date
   - f/u ID recs.  Will not start rifampin at this time b/c of unclear
   added benefit. ID recommended adding VZV to CSF
 called lab but not
   enough CSF to send.  Also recommended total IgG
 discussed on rounds
   yesterday and felt likely not to be helpful and want to limit
   phlebotomy given patients low Hct.
   - serum toxo, lyme, cmv negative; ebv labs show evidence of prior
   infection, mycoplasma labs show evidence of prior exposure to
   mycoplasma but no active infection.
   - labs for other possible causes: bartonella, LCMV, histo, anaplasma,
   erlichia, WNV, Qfever pending.
   - respiratory virus studies Ag negative, can d/c droplet precautions.
   .
   #Seizure - tonic clonic per report likely [**3-15**] meningitis vs
   encephalitis as above.  Treated with ativan/dilantin at OSH with no
   obvious seizure activity since arrival here although persistant AMS
   possibly [**3-15**] subclinical seizure vs infection.  CT scan reassuring for
   no c-spine fracture or cord compression.  Discussed with EEG attending
   and no evidence of seizures on EEG monitoring from [**12-30**] or am of
   [**12-31**].  Discussed with neuro and need to resume continuous EEG
   monitoring given that patient still has persistent AMS. On Keppra and
   Lyrica for seizure prophylaxis.  Has had some rhythmic muscle movements
   over the last 24 hours concerning for possible focal motor seizure
   activity per neurology. As per neurology recs, should d/c keppra and
   load w/phosphenytoin. Should check phenytoin level 1 hr after load.
   -f/u neurology recs
   -continue Lyrica (started [**1-3**])
   - d/c Keppra
   - phosphenytoin load, check level 1 hr later
   -continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   -ativan prn for presumed forcal motor seziures
   - sedation with ativan & fentanyl, give sedation breaks to assess MS.
   .
   # Aspiration Pneumonitis
 Now intubated for airway protection.  Likely
   aspiration pneumonitis given improvement on CXR, clinically.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated
   - minimal sedation to assess neuro status
   - continue current antibiotic coverage
   .
   #Diarrhea
 CDiff negative x3.  Could be med SE.  Will hopefully clear
   up now that most antibiotics are d/c. Bowel regimen is prn.
   .
   #MRI findings
 enhancement of sulci with ?SAH.  Not seen on CT or LP
   results.  Low likelihood of SAH given CT and LP results.
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 3899**]
 Unclear etiology but relatively stable today.
   Hepatitis panel shows prior immunization.  Tylenol d/c. did not improve
   when dilantin was d/c earlier so likely not due to dilantin. Could be
   SE from other medicine. Abdominal u/s normal (small inconsequential
   polyp in GB).
   - will try Ibuprofen before Tylenol to manage fevers

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old physician who presented to the emergency department with status epilepticus. They have a history of lymphocytic predominance, very poor MS, and MRI findings suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is currently intubated and on EEG monitoring. They are experiencing left temporal and right frontal seizures, as well as right facial twitching seizures. The impression is viral encephalitis with an unclear cause. 

The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and anti-seizure medications. They have also received a cooling blanket for fevers. The patient's vital signs have been monitored, showing an increased temperature, normal heart rate, stable blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation remains at 100%.

The patient's fluid balance has been closely monitored, with an intake-output balance of 4,030-1,848 mL since 12 AM. Blood products have been transfused, and urine output has been recorded at 3,735 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Liver function tests (LFTs) indicate elevated ALT and AST levels. Blood electrolytes reveal low potassium (K+) levels and normal calcium (Ca++) and magnesium (Mg++) levels. Other lab results show elevated lactate"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningitis vs encephalitis.  No clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be stable and depressed.
   Electively intubated on [**12-31**] for airway protection and periods of
   apnea.  No clear organism.
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: thus far seems most c/w viral meningitis
   given lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from
   OSH and here.  G-stain from [**Location (un) **] shows no organisms, only polys and
   PCR negative for EBV and enterovirus.  HSV encephalitis is also on ddx
   at this time pending further data from CSF PCR. Neuro exam inconsistent
   and difficult to assess when patient sedated.  Currently covered
   broadly for both bacterial and viral meningitis as well as mycoplasma
   with Ampicillin, Doxycyclin, and Acyclovir.  Unlikely given 2 LPs with
   lymphocytosis and negative gram stains that patient has a bacterial
   meningitis so ABx can be scaled back.  MRI shows increased signal in
   sulci of unclear significance but c/w SAH.  LP and CT scan do not show
   evidence of SAH.  CSF at [**Location (un) **] NOT sent for EEE, WNV, CMV because
   they had no more CSF to send. Collected and ordered on CSF from [**1-1**]
   LP in [**Hospital1 19**] MICU.   OP on repeat LP was 29.  Vanco stopped [**1-3**] and
   Ceftriaxone to stop [**1-4**] given lack of evidence for bacterial
   meningitis. Ampicillin d/c today.
   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir
   - daily f/u lab results from [**Location (un) **]
        - per [**Location (un) **], pending CSF studies are parvovirus B19, HSV VZV and
   final cultures
        - as of [**2122-1-5**], CSF culture data is no growth to date
   - f/u ID recs.  Will not start rifampin at this time b/c of unclear
   added benefit. ID recommended adding VZV to CSF
 called lab but not
   enough CSF to send.  Also recommended total IgG
 discussed on rounds
   yesterday and felt likely not to be helpful and want to limit
   phlebotomy given patients low Hct.
   - serum toxo, lyme, cmv negative; ebv labs show evidence of prior
   infection, mycoplasma labs show evidence of prior exposure to
   mycoplasma but no active infection.
   - labs for other possible causes: bartonella, LCMV, histo, anaplasma,
   erlichia, WNV, Qfever pending.
   - respiratory virus studies Ag negative, can d/c droplet precautions.
   .
   #Seizure - tonic clonic per report likely [**3-15**] meningitis vs
   encephalitis as above.  Treated with ativan/dilantin at OSH with no
   obvious seizure activity since arrival here although persistant AMS
   possibly [**3-15**] subclinical seizure vs infection.  CT scan reassuring for
   no c-spine fracture or cord compression.  Discussed with EEG attending
   and no evidence of seizures on EEG monitoring from [**12-30**] or am of
   [**12-31**].  Discussed with neuro and need to resume continuous EEG
   monitoring given that patient still has persistent AMS. On Keppra and
   Lyrica for seizure prophylaxis.  Has had some rhythmic muscle movements
   over the last 24 hours concerning for possible focal motor seizure
   activity per neurology. As per neurology recs, should d/c keppra and
   load w/phosphenytoin. Should check phenytoin level 1 hr after load.
   -f/u neurology recs
   -continue Lyrica (started [**1-3**])
   - d/c Keppra
   - phosphenytoin load, check level 1 hr later
   -continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   -ativan prn for presumed forcal motor seziures
   - sedation with ativan & fentanyl, give sedation breaks to assess MS.
   .
   # Aspiration Pneumonitis
 Now intubated for airway protection.  Likely
   aspiration pneumonitis given improvement on CXR, clinically.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated
   - minimal sedation to assess neuro status
   - continue current antibiotic coverage
   .
   #Diarrhea
 CDiff negative x3.  Could be med SE.  Will hopefully clear
   up now that most antibiotics are d/c. Bowel regimen is prn.
   .
   #MRI findings
 enhancement of sulci with ?SAH.  Not seen on CT or LP
   results.  Low likelihood of SAH given CT and LP results.
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 3899**]
 Unclear etiology but relatively stable today.
   Hepatitis panel shows prior immunization.  Tylenol d/c. did not improve
   when dilantin was d/c earlier so likely not due to dilantin. Could be
   SE from other medicine. Abdominal u/s normal (small inconsequential
   polyp in GB).
   - will try Ibuprofen before Tylenol to manage fevers
   - daily LFT's

   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: Clinical picture most consistent with
   viral meningitis given lymphocyte predominance and normal
   protein/glucose on CSF from OSH and here.  Thus far, no causative
   organism isolated.  Multiple studies from [**Location (un) **] and [**Hospital1 19**] still
   pending.  ID is following.  Fever broke this morning and clinically
   patient is more alert.
   - continue doxycycline and acyclovir
   - continue to supportive care
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   #Seizures: Per neuro yesterday ([**1-5**]) patient was continuing to have
   seizures on EEG that were not apparent clinically as well as focal
   motor seizures that were not registering on EEG.  Continuing Keppra,
   Lyrica was stopped, patient was reloaded with Dilantin (therapeutic
   level overnight), and versed drip started to control seizure activity.
   Per neuro, EEG is now improved.  Patient is more alert and responding
   to team this morning, but not able to move extremities on command.
   - continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   - sedation with ativan & fentanyl, give sedation breaks to assess MS.
   .
   # Intubation
 Patient was intubated for airway protection (copious
   secretions) and periods of apnea.  Secretions improved, though patient
   continues to have periods of apnea.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated with daily
   PSV trials
   - minimize sedation as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to
   assess neuro status

The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningitis or encephalitis. She has been intubated for airway protection and periods of apnea. The initial clinical picture is most consistent with viral meningitis given the lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, no causative organism has been identified yet. The patient's fever has broken, and she appears to be more alert.

Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient is experiencing seizures, both clinically apparent and subclinical. EEG shows seizures that are not apparent clinically, while focal motor seizures are not registering on EEG. The patient is currently on phenytoin, keppra, and a versed drip to control seizure activity. Continuous EEG will be monitored to evaluate for subclinical seizures.
2. Intubation: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to copious secretions and periods of apnea. Secretions have improved, but the patient continues to have periods of apnea. Vent settings will be weaned daily with PSV trials while minimizing sedation as tolerated.
3. Hepatitis: The patient has an unclear etiology of hepatitis, but liver function tests are trending downward. A hepatitis panel shows prior immunization, and Tylenol has been discontinued. An abdominal ultrasound is normal, except for a small"

The patient's fever has decreased today, but she still has ongoing twitching episodes. She is being treated for treatable causes of encephalitis.

The patient has no known drug allergies. She has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and doxycycline. She is also on midazolam (versed), lorazepam (ativan), ranitidine (prophylaxis), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and fosphenytoin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her neurological exam shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately, but her movement, tone, and other neurological assessments are not available.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, platelet count of 375 K/uL, sodium level of 110 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.5 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and glucose level of 104 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes and abnormal blood gases.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with settings of Vt (set) at 500 mL, Vt (spontaneous) at 418 mL, PS at 0 cmH2O, RR (set) at 12 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and RSBI at 63. Her ABG values are as follows: pH 7.28, PCO2 28 mmHg, PO2 104 mmHg, HCO3- 34 mEq/L, and Base excess -10 mEq/L.

The patient's physical exam reveals well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and normal bowel sounds. Her extremities are absent on the right side and present on the left side. Neurological assessment is incomplete.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and further deterioration of neurological status. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent these complications and optimize the patient's condition."

   #Seizures: Per neuro yesterday ([**1-5**]) patient was continuing to have
   seizures on EEG that were not apparent clinically as well as focal
   motor seizures that were not registering on EEG.  Continuing Keppra,
   Lyrica was stopped, patient was reloaded with Dilantin (therapeutic
   level overnight), and versed drip started to control seizure activity.
   Per neuro, EEG is now improved.  Patient is more alert and responding
   to team this morning, but not able to move extremities on command.
   - continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   - sedation with ativan & fentanyl, give sedation breaks to assess MS.

   # Intubation
 Patient was intubated for airway protection (copious
   secretions) and periods of apnea.  Secretions improved, though patient
   continues to have periods of apnea.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated with daily
   PSV trials
   - minimize sedation as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to
   assess neuro status

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizures and lumbar puncture, presenting with meningitis or encephalitis. The patient was transferred from another hospital with no clear improvement and mental status that appears to be stable but depressed. She was electively intubated for airway protection and periods of apnea. The clinical picture suggests viral meningitis given the lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Multiple tests are still pending, and Infectious Disease is following up.

The patient has been on doxycycline and acyclovir, and supportive care continues. The seizures have been managed with Keppra, and Dilantin has been started (therapeutic level overnight). The patient is more alert and responding to the team, but not able to move extremities on command. Continuous EEG is being done to evaluate for subclinical seizures. Sedation with ativan & fentanyl will be given, with sedation breaks to assess mental status.

The patient was intubated for airway protection and periods of apnea. Secretions have improved, but the patient continues to have periods of apnea. Vent settings will be weaned as tolerated with daily PSV trials. The patient's neuro status will be assessed while minimizing sedation.

Other assessments include an unclear etiology of fever with a trend downward, hepatitis panel showing prior immunization, and an abdominal ultrasound showing a small"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis.  Now with  clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be improving.  Electively
   intubated on [**12-31**] for airway protection and periods of apnea. HSV
   pending at [**Location (un) **], negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: Mental status improved today, able to
   follow commands and move all 4 extremities. Clinical picture most
   consistent with viral meningoencephalitis given lymphocyte predominance
   and normal protein/glucose on CSF from OSH and here. So far HSV PCR,
   bartonella, respiratory viruses, RPR are negative so far. CSF Cx and
   Bcx are pending.  [**Month (only) 51**] be consistent with west [**Doctor First Name **] encephalitis given
   flaccid paralysis.
   - MRI/MRV to eval for venous sinus thrombosis
   - continue doxycycline and acyclovir d/c acyclovir if MRI is
   reassuring.
   - continue supportive care
   .
   #Seizures: Per neuro today patient is continuing to have seizures on
   EEG that are not apparent clinically as well as focal motor seizures
   that were not registering on EEG.  Dilantin level not therapeutic but
   neuro is doubtful that it will help as she was having seizures with a
   therapeutic level.
   - Phenobarbital per neuro, once this is therapeutic may decrease midaz.
   - continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   - sedation with ativan & fentanyl, give sedation breaks to assess MS.
   .
   # Intubation
 Patient was intubated for airway protection (copious
   secretions) and periods of apnea.  Secretions improved, though patient
   continues to have periods of apnea on spontaneous breathing trial
   today.  Likely midazolam is contributing to apneic episodes.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated with daily
   PSV trials
   - minimize sedation as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to
   assess neuro status
   .
   # Transaminitis
 Continues trending downward, probable mild viral
   hepatitis.  Hepatitis panel shows prior immunization.  Tylenol d/c.
   Abdominal u/s normal (small inconsequential polyp in GB).

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningoencephalitis. She is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement in her mental status, able to follow commands and move all four extremities. The clinical picture suggests viral meningoencephalitis, with negative results for HSV PCR, Bartonella, respiratory viruses, and RPR. CSF Cx and Bcx are pending. An MRI/MRV is ordered to evaluate for venous sinus thrombosis, and she will continue on doxycycline and acyclovir, with plans to discontinue acyclovir if the MRI is reassuring. Supportive care will also be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient continues to have seizures, both clinically apparent and subclinical, despite therapeutic levels of phenytoin. Continuous EEG monitoring is ongoing to evaluate for subclinical seizures. Sedation with midazolam and fentanyl will be given while assessing mental status.
2. Apnea: The patient has periods of apnea on spontaneous breathing trials, likely due to midazolam sedation. Vent settings will be weaned as tolerated with daily pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has trending downward liver enzymes, likely due to mild viral hepatitis. Tylenol has been discontinued, and Ibuprofen will be given"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis.  Now with  clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be improving.  Electively
   intubated on [**12-31**] for airway protection and periods of apnea. HSV
   pending at [**Location (un) **], negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: Clinical picture most consistent with
   viral meningoencephalitis given lymphocyte predominance and normal
   protein/glucose on CSF from OSH and here. So far HSV PCR, bartonella,
   respiratory viruses, RPR are negative so far. CSF Cx and Bcx are
   pending.  [**Month (only) 51**] be consistent with west [**Doctor First Name **] encephalitis given flaccid
   paralysis.
   - continue doxycycline and acyclovir d/c acyclovir if MRI is
   reassuring.
   - continue to supportive care
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   #Seizures: Per neuro yesterday ([**1-5**]) patient was continuing to have
   seizures on EEG that were not apparent clinically as well as focal
   motor seizures that were not registering on EEG.  Continuing Keppra,
   Lyrica was stopped, patient was reloaded with Dilantin (therapeutic
   level overnight), and versed drip started to control seizure activity.
    Per neuro, EEG is now improved.  Patient is more alert and responding
   to team this morning, but not able to move extremities on command.
   - continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   - sedation with ativan & fentanyl, give sedation breaks to assess MS.
   .
   # Intubation
 Patient was intubated for airway protection (copious
   secretions) and periods of apnea.  Secretions improved, though patient
   continues to have periods of apnea.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated with daily
   PSV trials
   - minimize sedation as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to
   assess neuro status
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 3899**]
 Unclear etiology but trending downward.  Hepatitis
   panel shows prior immunization.  Tylenol d/c. Abdominal u/s normal
   (small inconsequential polyp in GB).
   - Ibuprofen for  fevers

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) consistent with meningoencephalitis. She was intubated for airway protection and periods of apnea. The patient is currently showing clear improvement in mental status. The clinical picture suggests viral meningoencephalitis given the lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). HSV PCR, Bartonella, respiratory viruses, and RPR have been negative so far. CSF cultures and blood cultures are pending. The patient is being treated with doxycycline and acyclovir, with plans to discontinue acyclovir if the MRI is reassuring. Supportive care is also being continued. 

The patient experienced seizures, which were controlled with Keppra and a versed drip. The EEG showed improvement, and the patient is more alert and responsive. However, she is not able to move her extremities on command. Continuous EEG will be monitored to evaluate for subclinical seizures. Sedation will be given with ativan and fentanyl, with sedation breaks to assess mental status.

The patient was intubated for airway protection and periods of apnea. Vent settings will be weaned as tolerated with daily pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials. Sedation will be minimized while still suppressing seizures to assess neuro status.

The patient has an unclear etiology"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])  Tried on PSV today and
   looks good, will try to switch her over.
   Encephalitis:  Improving fever curve.  More awake, now moving all
   limbs.  On dilantin, but lower end of therapeutic scale, LFTs stable.
   Will discuss with neuro re: switching to phenobarb.
   Will discuss with ID and neuro re: need for MRI given clinical
   improvement.

","The patient is a 41-year-old woman with encephalitis and status epilepticus. She is currently sedated and experiencing encephalopathy. She has been receiving various medications, including acyclovir, fosphenytoin, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and midazolam (Versed). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/65 mmHg to 119/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for diminished seizure activity. Her physical examination shows no acute distress, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin without rash, and attentive neurological status with movement and tone assessed as normal.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, low potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L, slightly elevated glucose level of 136 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests with AST and ALT levels elevated at 49 and 129 U/L, respectively. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,660 mL and output of 3,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted with a seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningoencephalitis. She has shown clear improvement in mental status, able to follow commands and move all four extremities. Her clinical picture is most consistent with viral meningoencephalitis, with a lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). HSV PCR, Bartonella, respiratory viruses, and RPR have been negative so far. CSF cultures and blood cultures are pending.

The patient continues to have seizures on EEG that are not apparent clinically, as well as focal motor seizures that were not registering on EEG. The patient's dilantin level is not therapeutic, but the neurologist doubts it will help as she was having seizures with a therapeutic level. They plan to administer phenobarbital per neuro, once it is therapeutic, and may decrease midazolam. Continuous EEG will be used to evaluate for subclinical seizures.

The patient was intubated for airway protection and periods of apnea. Secretions have improved, although the patient continues to have periods of apnea on spontaneous breathing trial today. Likely midazolam is contributing to apneic episodes. They will continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated with daily pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials. They will also minimize sedation as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to assess neuro status"

   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: Mental status improved today, able to
   follow commands and move all 4 extremities. Clinical picture most
   consistent with viral meningoencephalitis given lymphocyte predominance
   and normal protein/glucose on CSF from OSH and here.  Initial MRI/MRV
   was basically normal but repeat MRI showed significant change with a
   preliminary read of multifocal gyroform swelling of the B/L cerebral
   cortices that are patchy and non-specific, along with swelling of the
   right orbital frontal gyrus, the insular cortex B/L, and B/L
   medial/temporal gyri.  According to the neuroradiologist, these
   findings are classic for HSV encephalitis and certain other herpetic
mimics.
  Some of these changes could also be c/w protracted seizures
   (which we know she has had), although this should be a Dx of
   exclusion.  Of note, the venous sinuses were normal and her brainstem
   was unaffected.  She did have one temp of 100.3, but has been otherwise
   febrile for almost 3 days now.  ID and neuron recs appreciated.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus. Pending for
   parvovirus. Blood:
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg

","The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizures and lumbar puncture consistent with meningoencephalitis. She was transferred to the ICU for airway protection and periods of apnea. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Her condition has shown improvement, with mental status improving and the ability to follow commands and move all four extremities. The clinical picture is most consistent with viral meningoencephalitis, given the lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from outside hospital and here. 

Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no significant abnormalities, but a repeat MRI demonstrated multifocal gyral swelling of the bilateral cerebral cortices that are patchy and non-specific, along with swelling of the right orbital frontal gyrus, the insular cortex bilaterally, and bilateral medial/temporal gyri. These findings are classic for herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis and certain other herpetic mimics.

The patient's blood and CSF studies have been negative for various infections, including HSV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), enterovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, Cryptococcus, fungal and viral cultures, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) culture. Blood cultures have also been negative for several organisms.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with several medical complications. These include seizure activity, acute respiratory failure, fever, rash, and altered mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and receiving various medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, phenobarbital, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/43 mmHg to 130/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring is in place, and fluid balance is being closely monitored.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. Renal function appears to be within normal limits, and electrolyte levels are also within normal ranges.

The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and management of potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is set to full code, indicating that all resuscitative measures should be taken if the patient's heart stops or if they stop breathing.

Overall, the patient is being closely monitored and managed for multiple medical complications in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis.  Now with  clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be improving.  Electively
   intubated on [**12-31**] for airway protection and periods of apnea. HSV
   pending at [**Location (un) **], negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: Mental status improved today, able to
   follow commands and move all 4 extremities. Clinical picture most
   consistent with viral meningoencephalitis given lymphocyte predominance
   and normal protein/glucose on CSF from OSH and here.  Initial MRI/MRV
   was basically normal but repeat MRI showed significant change with a
   preliminary read of multifocal gyroform swelling of the B/L cerebral
   cortices that are patchy and non-specific, along with swelling of the
   right orbital frontal gyrus, the insular cortex B/L, and B/L
   medial/temporal gyri.  According to the neuroradiologist, these
   findings are classic for HSV encephalitis and certain other herpetic
mimics.
  Some of these changes could also be c/w protracted seizures
   (which we know she has had), although this should be a Dx of
   exclusion.  Of note, the venous sinuses were normal and her brainstem
   was unaffected.  She did have one temp of 100.3, but has been otherwise
   febrile for almost 3 days now.  ID and neuro recs appreciated. Mental
   status much improved tomorrow.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus. Pending for
   parvovirus. Blood:
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal and viral prelim
   CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is pending.  Blood: Negative
   for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV, Lyme, EBV. Blood Cx
   negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**], [**1-1**].
   - continue doxycycline and acyclovir
   - add ampicillin 2g IV Q4h as per neurology recs to cover listeria.
   - continue supportive care
   .
   #Seizures: Patient had been having seizure activity on EEG that was not
   apparent clinically.  Patient currently on Dilantin and Keppra, now
   started on Phenobarbital overnight as per neurology recommendations.
   - Phenobarbital level after 4^th dose as per neuron and base standing
   dose on level.  Once therapeutic may decrease midaz (or if patient is
   too sleepy)
   - continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures
   - sedation with midazolam & fentanyl
   .
   # Intubation: Patient was intubated for airway protection (copious
   secretions) and periods of apnea.  Secretions improved, though patient
   continues to have periods of apnea on spontaneous breathing trial
   today.  Likely midazolam is contributing to apneic episodes.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated with daily
   PSV trials
   - minimize sedation as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to
   assess neuro status
   .
   # Transaminitis: Continues trending downward, probable mild viral
   hepatitis.  Hepatitis panel shows prior immunization.  Tylenol d/c.
   Abdominal u/s normal (small inconsequential polyp in GB).
   - Ibuprofen for  fevers
   - cont. to monitor LFT's while on Dilantin.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Sinus tach on monitor. Checked EKG, also sinus
   tachycardia.  EKG during period of tachycardia to 160 showed SVT.
   Patient denies pain, but appears anxious.  Seems to correlate well
   w/stimulation/agitation and trends down with improved sedation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted with a seizure and lumbar puncture, which indicated meningoencephalitis. The patient's mental status has been improving, and the clinical picture is consistent with viral meningoencephalitis. The initial MRI/MRV showed normal findings, but a repeat MRI revealed multifocal gyral swelling of the bilateral cerebral cortices, right orbital frontal gyrus, insular cortex bilaterally, and bilateral medial/temporal gyri. These findings are classic for herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis and other herpetic mimics.

The patient was intubated for airway protection and periods of apnea. She continues to have periods of apnea on spontaneous breathing trials, likely due to midazolam sedation. The patient is being weaned off ventilator settings as tolerated with daily pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials.

Seizure management includes continuous EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures. The patient is currently on phenobarbital, which will be based on the level after the fourth dose. Midazolam and fentanyl sedation will be minimized as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to assess neuro status.

Transaminitis is trending downward, likely due to mild viral hepatitis. Hepatitis panel shows prior immunization, and Tylenol is discontinued. Abdominal ultrasound is normal, except for a small inconsequential polyp in the gallbl"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with encephalitis. She has been receiving various treatments including acyclovir, phenobarbital, midazolam, fentanyl, and fosphenytoin. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 106/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 87. The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, with clear breath sounds, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. However, she exhibits hyporeflexia on the left side, minimal movement in her hands, and moves her left arm more than her right. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal potassium and sodium levels, slightly low bicarbonate level, elevated creatinine level, and normal glucose level. Imaging studies are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If her respiratory status worsens, she may require more aggressive interventions such as tracheostomy"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis.  Now with  clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be improving.  Electively
   intubated on [**12-31**] for airway protection and periods of apnea. HSV
   pending at [**Location (un) **], negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: Mental status remains stable, able to
   follow commands and move all 4 extremities in a limited fashion.
   Clinical picture most consistent with viral meningoencephalitis given
   lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from OSH and
   here.  Initial MRI/MRV was basically normal but repeat MRI showed
   significant change with a preliminary read of multifocal gyroform
   swelling of the B/L cerebral cortices that are patchy and non-specific,
   along with swelling of the right orbital frontal gyrus, the insular
   cortex B/L, and B/L medial/temporal gyri.  According to the
   neuroradiologist, these findings are classic for HSV encephalitis and
   certain other herpetic
mimics.
  Some of these changes could also be
   c/w protracted seizures (which we know she has had), although this
   should be a Dx of exclusion.  Of note, the venous sinuses were normal
   and her brainstem was unaffected.  ID and neuro recs appreciated.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus. Pending for
   parvovirus. Blood:
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal and viral prelim
   CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is pending.  Blood: Negative
   for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV, Lyme, EBV. RPR negative.
   Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**], [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: HHV-6, adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella,
   bartonella PCR, Erhlichia serology, VDRL
          [**Hospital1 19**]: [**Doctor First Name **] 1:80, speckled.
   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin.
   - continue supportive care
   .
   #Seizures: Patient is on Keppra, phenytoin, versed, and loaded with
   Phenobarbital yesterday afternoon.  Per nursing report, she was very
   somnolent yesterday evening and not responding to sternal rub.   Versed
   had also been decreased to 10 yesterday morning.  Per neuro patient had
   decreased seizures the day before yesterday (prior to phenobarb with
   versed at 14-18), but may have been having increased seizures
   overnight, need to confirm.  Unclear whether somnolence was secondary
   to phenobarb or increased seizure activity.  Patient did have some
   twitching in her right hand on rounds this morning.
   - Will continue phenobarbital, phenytoin, Keppra at current doses,
   versed increased to 14.
   - will discuss with neuro today whether doses on phenobarb and
   phenytoin need adjustment and how often levels should be checked
   - will also check with neuro whether CT torso for paraneoplastic w/u is
   necessary in light of new MRI findings
   - will discuss brain biopsy with neuro as well.
   .
   # Intubation: Patient was intubated for airway protection (copious
   secretions) and periods of apnea.  Secretions improved.  Patient
   tolerated PSV x 3 hrs yesterday, but then became tachypnic and
   anxious.  Underlying neurologic process likely contributing to apnea.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated with daily
   PSV trials; patient will not be able to be extubated until versed off
   and apnea resolved.
   - minimize sedation as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to
   assess neuro status
   .
   # Transaminitis: Continues trending downward, probable mild viral
   hepatitis.  Hepatitis panel shows prior immunization.  Tylenol d/c.
   Abdominal u/s normal (small inconsequential polyp in GB).
   - Ibuprofen for  fevers
   - cont. to monitor LFT's while on Dilantin.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Sinus tach on monitor. Checked EKG, also sinus
   tachycardia.  EKG during period of tachycardia to 160 showed SVT.
   Patient denies pain, but appears anxious.  Seems to correlate well
   w/stimulation/agitation and trends down with improved sedation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics and antiviral medications, including ampicillin, acyclovir, and doxycycline. The patient's mental status is improving, and she is able to follow commands and move all four extremities in a limited fashion.

The MRI/MRV findings show multifocal gyriform swelling of the bilateral cerebral cortices, patchy and nonspecific, along with swelling of the right orbital frontal gyrus, the insular cortex bilaterally, and bilateral medial/temporal gyri. These findings are consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis and certain other herpetic mimics. Some of these changes could also be related to protracted seizures, which the patient has experienced.

The patient is currently on phenobarbital, phenytoin, keppra, and midazolam for seizure control. The phenobarbital level from yesterday at 2 pm was 29.1. The patient's blood cultures are negative for various organisms, including HSV. CSF analysis shows lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizures and lumbar puncture, who was transferred from another hospital with a diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. She has been intubated for airway protection and periods of apnea. The patient is currently on multiple antiseizure medications and antibiotics. Her mental status is improving, and she is able to follow commands and move all four extremities. The MRI/MRV showed significant changes consistent with viral meningoencephalitis, possibly due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. The patient has also shown improvement in her laboratory results, including a decrease in white blood cell count and improvement in liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has been experiencing seizures, and there is a risk of further seizure activity. The current treatment includes multiple antiseizure medications (phenobarbital, phenytoin, keppra, and midazolam).
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures are being taken to minimize sedation and wean off the ventilator as tolerated.
3. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has a PICC line and a 20-gauge line. Proper care and monitoring should be done to prevent CLABSI.
4. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old woman with viral encephalitis who is experiencing multiple seizures overnight despite the addition of phenobarbital. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications that can arise.

1. Seizure: The patient continues to have seizures, and it is planned to discuss further care with neurology. The possibility of adding propofol is being considered.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not due to ARDS. It is suggested to try pressure support ventilation (PSV) again for a trial.

3. Fever: The patient had a fever but has since defervesced.

4. Rash: The patient has a rash.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status but not delirium.

6. ICU Care: The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage these potential complications appropriately."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving. Workup has been negative so far other than MRI
   progression being suggestive of herpetic involvement vs. protracted
   seizures.
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: Mental status improving slowly, able to
   follow commands and move all 4 extremities in a limited fashion.
   Clinical picture most consistent with viral meningoencephalitis given
   lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from OSH and
   here.  Initial MRI/MRV was basically normal but repeat MRI showed
   significant change with a preliminary read of multifocal gyroform
   swelling of the B/L cerebral cortices that are patchy and non-specific,
   along with swelling of the right orbital frontal gyrus, the insular
   cortex B/L, and B/L medial/temporal gyri.  According to the
   neuroradiologist, these findings are classic for HSV encephalitis and
   certain other herpetic
mimics.
  Some of these changes could also be
   c/w protracted seizures (which we know she has had), although this
   should be a Dx of exclusion.  Of note, the venous sinuses were normal
   and her brainstem was unaffected.  ID and neuro recs appreciated.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus. Pending for
   parvovirus. Blood:
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal and viral prelim
   CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is pending.  Blood: Negative
   for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV, Lyme, EBV. RPR negative.
   Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**], [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: HHV-6, adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella,
   bartonella PCR, Erhlichia serology, VDRL
          [**Hospital1 19**]: [**Doctor First Name **] 1:80, speckled.
   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin.
   - continue supportive care
   .
   #Seizures: Patient is on Keppra, phenytoin, versed, and loaded with
   Phenobarbital yesterday afternoon.  Per nursing report, she was very
   somnolent yesterday evening and not responding to sternal rub.   Versed
   had also been decreased to 10 yesterday morning.  Per neuro patient had
   decreased seizures the day before yesterday (prior to phenobarb with
   versed at 14-18), but may have been having increased seizures
   overnight, need to confirm.  Unclear whether somnolence was secondary
   to phenobarb or increased seizure activity.  Patient did have some
   twitching in her right hand on rounds this morning.
   - Will continue phenobarbital, phenytoin, Keppra at current doses,
   versed increased to 14.
   - will discuss with neuro today whether doses on phenobarb and
   phenytoin need adjustment and how often levels should be checked
   - will also check with neuro whether CT torso for paraneoplastic w/u is
   necessary in light of new MRI findings
   - will discuss brain biopsy with neuro as well.
   .
   # Intubation: Patient was intubated for airway protection (copious
   secretions) and periods of apnea.  Secretions improved.  Patient
   tolerated PSV x 3 hrs yesterday, but then became tachypnic and
   anxious.  Underlying neurologic process likely contributing to apnea.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated with daily
   PSV trials; patient will not be able to be extubated until versed off
   and apnea resolved.
   - minimize sedation as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to
   assess neuro status
   .
   # Transaminitis: Continues trending downward, probable mild viral
   hepatitis.  Hepatitis panel shows prior immunization.  Tylenol d/c.
   Abdominal u/s normal (small inconsequential polyp in GB).
   - Ibuprofen for  fevers
   - cont. to monitor LFT's while on Dilantin.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Sinus tach on monitor. Checked EKG, also sinus
   tachycardia.  EKG during period of tachycardia to 160 showed SVT.
   Patient denies pain, but appears anxious.  Seems to correlate well
   w/stimulation/agitation and trends down with improved sedation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) showing meningoencephalitis. The clinical picture suggests viral meningoencephalitis, and initial MRI/MRV was normal but a repeat MRI showed multifocal gyral swelling in the bilateral cerebral cortices, right orbital frontal gyrus, insular cortex bilaterally, and bilateral medial/temporal gyri, which are classic findings for HSV encephalitis.

The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and she is able to follow commands and move all four extremities in a limited fashion. The patient has been started on acyclovir and ampicillin, and supportive care will continue.

The patient's seizures are being managed with Keppra, phenytoin, versed, and a recent load of phenobarbital. The dosage of phenobarbital and phenytoin may need adjustment, and their levels should be monitored regularly. The neurology team will discuss these matters further.

A CT torso for a paraneoplastic work-up is being considered in light of new MRI findings, and a brain biopsy may also be discussed with the neurology team.

The patient was intubated for airway protection due to copious secretions and periods of apnea. She tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) for three hours but then became tachypnic and anxious."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a chief complaint of seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) consistent with meningoencephalitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions and tests.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.8 C (100.1 F)
- Heart rate: 101 bpm (with a range of 92-117 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 113/71 mmHg (with a range of 80-134/56-94 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (with a range of 12-24 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium levels. Liver function tests are mildly abnormal with elevated liver enzymes and low albumin levels. The renal function tests are normal.

The patient's neurologic examination reveals somnolence with intermittent responsiveness, pupils that are 4 mm, equal, and reactive bilaterally, warm extremities without edema, and normal bowel sounds. Motor function is improving, but there is no patellar reflex in both lower extremities and 1+ reflexes in both upper extremities. Clonus is present in the feet"

   #Seizures: Patient is on Keppra, phenytoin, versed, and loaded with
   Phenobarbital yesterday afternoon.  Per nursing report, she was very
   somnolent yesterday evening and not responding to sternal rub.   Versed
   had also been decreased to 10 yesterday morning.  Per neuro patient had
   decreased seizures the day before yesterday (prior to phenobarb with
   versed at 14-18), but may have been having increased seizures
   overnight, need to confirm.  Unclear whether somnolence was secondary
   to phenobarb or increased seizure activity.  Patient did have some
   twitching in her right hand on rounds this morning.
   - Will continue phenobarbital, phenytoin, Keppra at current doses,
   versed increased to 14.
   - will discuss with neuro today whether doses on phenobarb and
   phenytoin need adjustment and how often levels should be checked
   - will also check with neuro whether CT torso for paraneoplastic w/u is
   necessary in light of new MRI findings
   - will discuss brain biopsy with neuro as well.
   .
   # Intubation: Patient was intubated for airway protection (copious
   secretions) and periods of apnea.  Secretions improved.  Patient
   tolerated PSV x 3 hrs yesterday, but then became tachypnic and
   anxious.  Underlying neurologic process likely contributing to apnea.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated with daily
   PSV trials; patient will not be able to be extubated until versed off
   and apnea resolved.
   - minimize sedation as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to
   assess neuro status
   .
   # Transaminitis: Continues trending downward, probable mild viral
   hepatitis.  Hepatitis panel shows prior immunization.  Tylenol d/c.
   Abdominal u/s normal (small inconsequential polyp in GB).
   - Ibuprofen for  fevers
   - cont. to monitor LFT's while on Dilantin.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Sinus tach on monitor. Checked EKG, also sinus
   tachycardia.  EKG during period of tachycardia to 160 showed SVT.
   Patient denies pain, but appears anxious.  Seems to correlate well
   w/stimulation/agitation and trends down with improved sedation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 41-year-old female with a chief complaint of seizure and lumbar puncture.
- She has been transferred from another hospital with a diagnosis of meningoencephalitis.
- Her mental status has been slowly improving, but she remains somnolent and only responds intermittently.
- The workup so far has been negative, except for MRI progression suggestive of herpetic involvement or protracted seizures.
- The patient is currently receiving antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, keppra, versed), antibiotics (doxycycline, ampicillin), and antiviral medication (acyclovir).
- She is also receiving supportive care.
- The patient had an erythematous rash in the gluteal area and evidence of hepatic involvement.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Potential medical complications include seizures, meningitis vs encephalitis, tachycardia, transaminitis, and possible paraneoplastic syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient continues to experience seizures, which are being managed with multiple antiepileptic medications. Close monitoring and adjustment of medication doses may be necessary.
2. Meningitis vs Encephalitis: The initial diagnosis was meningoencephalitis, but further workup is pending to differentiate"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis.  Now with  clear
   improvement, mental status appears to be improving.  Electively
   intubated on [**12-31**] for airway protection and periods of apnea. HSV
   pending at [**Location (un) **], negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   .
   # Meningitis vs Encephalitis: Mental status remains stable, able to
   follow commands and move all 4 extremities in a limited fashion.
   Clinical picture most consistent with viral meningoencephalitis given
   lymphocyte predominance and normal protein/glucose on CSF from OSH and
   here.  Initial MRI/MRV was basically normal but repeat MRI showed
   significant change with a preliminary read of multifocal gyroform
   swelling of the B/L cerebral cortices that are patchy and non-specific,
   along with swelling of the right orbital frontal gyrus, the insular
   cortex B/L, and B/L medial/temporal gyri.  According to the
   neuroradiologist, these findings are classic for HSV encephalitis and
   certain other herpetic
mimics.
  Some of these changes could also be
   c/w protracted seizures (which we know she has had), although this
   should be a Dx of exclusion.  Of note, the venous sinuses were normal
   and her brainstem was unaffected.  ID and neuro recs appreciated.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus. Pending for
   parvovirus. Blood:
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal and viral prelim
   CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is pending.  Blood: Negative
   for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV, Lyme, EBV. RPR negative.
   Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**], [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: HHV-6, adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella,
   bartonella PCR, Erhlichia serology, VDRL
          [**Hospital1 19**]: [**Doctor First Name **] 1:80, speckled.
   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin.
   - continue supportive care
   .
   #Seizures: Patient is on Keppra, phenytoin, versed, and loaded with
   Phenobarbital yesterday afternoon.  Per nursing report, she was very
   somnolent yesterday evening and not responding to sternal rub.   Versed
   had also been decreased to 10 yesterday morning.  Per neuro patient had
   decreased seizures the day before yesterday (prior to phenobarb with
   versed at 14-18), but may have been having increased seizures
   overnight, need to confirm.  Unclear whether somnolence was secondary
   to phenobarb or increased seizure activity.  Patient did have some
   twitching in her right hand on rounds this morning.
   - Will continue phenobarbital, phenytoin, Keppra at current doses,
   versed increased to 14.
   - will discuss with neuro today whether doses on phenobarb and
   phenytoin need adjustment and how often levels should be checked
   - will also check with neuro whether CT torso for paraneoplastic w/u is
   necessary in light of new MRI findings
   - will discuss brain biopsy with neuro as well.
   .
   # Intubation: Patient was intubated for airway protection (copious
   secretions) and periods of apnea.  Secretions improved.  Patient
   tolerated PSV x 3 hrs yesterday, but then became tachypnic and
   anxious.  Underlying neurologic process likely contributing to apnea.
   - continue to monitor and wean vent settings as tolerated with daily
   PSV trials; patient will not be able to be extubated until versed off
   and apnea resolved.
   - minimize sedation as tolerated while still suppressing seizures to
   assess neuro status
   .
   # Transaminitis: Continues trending downward, probable mild viral
   hepatitis.  Hepatitis panel shows prior immunization.  Tylenol d/c.
   Abdominal u/s normal (small inconsequential polyp in GB).
   - Ibuprofen for  fevers
   - cont. to monitor LFT's while on Dilantin.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Sinus tach on monitor. Checked EKG, also sinus
   tachycardia.  EKG during period of tachycardia to 160 showed SVT.
   Patient denies pain, but appears anxious.  Seems to correlate well
   w/stimulation/agitation and trends down with improved sedation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. She underwent a lumbar puncture and was found to have lymphocyte predominance in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with normal protein/glucose levels. Initial MRI/MRV results were normal, but a repeat MRI showed multifocal gyral swelling in the bilateral cerebral cortices, right orbital frontal gyrus, insular cortex bilaterally, and bilateral medial/temporal gyri. These findings are consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis and other herpetic mimics. The patient has been receiving acyclovir, doxycycline, and ampicillin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has been experiencing seizures, for which she is on multiple antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, levetiracetam, lorazepam). The dosages of these medications may need to be adjusted based on her neurologic status.
2. Airway Protection: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to copious secretions and episodes of apnea. Weaning off the ventilator will be done gradually with daily pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials.
3. Intubation-Related Complications: There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury. The patient's sedation will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old physician who was admitted with new-onset seizures and persistent altered mental status. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture, which showed a decrease in white blood cell count. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. They are also receiving midazolam, fentanyl, ranitidine, and heparin sodium as part of their ICU care. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit, a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and blood pressure ranging from 102/74 to 134/94 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV) with assist, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's neurological examination reveals intermittent motor activation consistent with seizure activity, with responses to noxious stimuli and movement not assessed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently supported by mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilatory support will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Seizures: The patient continues to exhibit seizure activity, and medication management should be based on a review of the seizure activity over the past"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) who was admitted to the ICU with meningoencephalitis. Her mental status has been improving, and she is slowly regaining motor function. Serial MRI showed progression of inflammation suggesting herpetic involvement or protracted seizure activity. The patient has undergone several tests including LP with lymphocytosis, negative results for various viruses and bacteria, and pending results for HHV-6, adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella, VDRL, among others. She also has an elevated ESR and CRP. The patient is currently on doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin, and will continue with supportive care including seizure treatment. Repeat MRI is planned on Monday and Tuesday to evaluate for interval change.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis vs Encephalitis: The patient's symptoms could worsen if the cause of her condition is not accurately diagnosed. If it is determined to be meningitis or encephalitis, there is a risk of further neurological decline, seizures, and potential complications such as hearing loss or cognitive impairment.
2. Seizures: The patient continues to experience seizures despite being on multiple anti-seizure medications. If seizure control is not achieved, there is a risk of increased neurological damage, falls, and respiratory complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizure and lumbar puncture, indicating meningoencephalitis. Mental status improvement has been observed, but workup results have been negative so far except for MRI findings suggestive of herpetic involvement versus protracted seizures.

The patient is receiving treatment with acyclovir for suspected herpetic meningitis or encephalitis. Serial MRI showed progression of inflammation consistent with herpetic involvement. Neurosurgery consultation for brain biopsy has been deferred for now as the patient appears to be improving.

ID studies are pending for parvovirus, HHV-6, adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella, ehrlichia, VDRL, ANCA, and DSDNA. Blood and CSF cultures have been negative for various organisms.

The patient is still experiencing seizures despite being on multiple antiepileptic drugs. The neurology team is being consulted regarding phenobarbital trough levels and dosing adjustments.

The patient's intubation status is complicated by high RSBI and inability to pull sufficient tidal volumes. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failed due to high RSBI but no apnea.

Transaminitis is trending downward, likely due to mild viral hepatitis. Tachycardia is attributed to volume depletion with elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo female found with new onset seizure disorder and despite
   extensive investigations single souce of either meningitis or
   encephalitis have failed to be defined.  She has had improved control
   of seizure activity with escalating doses of phenobarbitol.  In
   addition--repeat LP has been completed and further testing sent with
   encouraging findings of decreased CNS WBC's, however, MRI has shown
   persistent of sub-cortical white matter disease.
   1)Respiratory Failure--Limited in move to extubation be secretions
   (less so), mental status and need to maintain stability of ventilatory
   support in the setting of significant central suppression of
   respiratory drive.  She does have clear times of alertness and
   responsiveness.
   -Move to PSV today
   -Follow secretion volume
   -Trial of SBT if favorable RSBI seen in the setting of increased
   Phenobarbitol dosing
   2)Seizure-
   -Versed 14mg/hr
   -Phenobarbitol
additional 200mg dose today
   -Keppra
   -F/U MRI next week to consider elevation
   -Continuous EEG

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, seizure, and altered mental status. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has improved, with increased alertness and responsiveness. She is being treated with phenobarbital for seizure control and various antibiotics for suspected meningitis or encephalitis. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but elevated liver enzymes. An MRI scan revealed persistent sub-cortical white matter disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is limiting her ability to wean off the ventilator. CNS-driven apneas and ongoing secretions continue to be concerns. The plan includes a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) if a favorable respiratory support burden index (RSBI) is observed.
2. Seizure: The patient is experiencing intermittent seizure activity despite ongoing treatment with midazolam and phenobarbital. Additional anti-seizure medications, such as keppra, are being considered. Continuous EEG monitoring is also suggested to optimize seizure control.
3. Meningitis/Encephalitis: The source of the infection remains unidentified. Acyclovir, ampicillin, and doxycycline are being administered as prophylactic treatment. Ongoing evaluations for possible sources, including vas"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 41-year-old female who was transferred to the hospital with a seizure and lumbar puncture showing meningoencephalitis. The mental status appears to be slowly improving with improved seizure control. The workup has been negative so far other than MRI progression suggestive of herpetic involvement versus protracted seizures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Meningitis vs Encephalitis: The patient's condition may worsen if the inflammation continues or if the herpetic involvement progresses.

2. Seizures: The patient is still experiencing seizures despite being on multiple anti-seizure medications. If the seizures become uncontrolled or more frequent, it could lead to further neurological damage or status epilepticus.

3. Intubation: The patient's ability to breathe independently is still uncertain. If she experiences respiratory failure again, she may require prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.

4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are still slightly elevated, indicating possible mild viral hepatitis. If the liver function continues to deteriorate, it could lead to acute liver failure.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is high, likely due to volume depletion and elevated hematocrit. If the tachycardia persists or worsens, it could indicate ongoing fluid losses or cardiac dysfunction.

6. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's physical mobility may be limited due to her current medical condition and the need"

","The patient is a 41-year-old female who was transferred to the hospital with a seizure and lumbar puncture, indicating meningoencephalitis. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and there is evidence of herpetic involvement on serial MRI scans. The patient has been experiencing frequent seizure activity, and multiple medications have been administered, including phenobarbital, versed, and levetiracetam. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist, with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 107/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Liver function tests reveal elevated ALT and AST levels, while electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's glucose level is slightly low at 83 mg/dL. The CSF analysis shows lymphocytic pleocytosis and negative viral, fungal, and bacterial cultures.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old individual with a diagnosis of encephalitis and status epilepticus. They are currently admitted to the ICU and have shown definite improvement in their condition. They are more interactive, following commands, and able to provide information about their personal life. However, they still require sedation during imaging procedures and ongoing respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizures, and there is a potential for further episodes. Adjustments to the phenobarbital dosage may be necessary based on neurologic recommendations.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and may require weaning trials after the MRI. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the weaning process is unsuccessful.
3. Vomiting: The patient experienced vomiting this morning, which could pose a risk of aspiration and potential complications related to the airway.
4. Rash: The patient has a rash, for which fluconazole was prescribed. It is important to monitor for any adverse reactions or allergic responses to the medication.
5. Encephalitis Progression: Although the patient has shown improvement, there is still a risk of disease progression or complications associated with encephalitis. Repeat MRI will help assess the current state of the condition.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. The patient's condition should be closely monitored, and any changes or concerns should"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been
   negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic
   involvement vs. protracted seizures.
   .
   #1 Meningitis vs Encephalitis: She is slowly regaining motor function.
   Serial MRI showed progression of inflammation c/w herpetic involvement
   vs protracted seizure activity.  LP x 3 w/lymphocytosis, last with far
   fewer WBC. All studies negative so far, still waiting for HHV-6,
   adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella, VDRL.  Repeat HSV and VZV also
   added on to most recent CSF studies.  Also considering autoimmune
   phenomenon or paraneoplastic syndrome.  [**Doctor First Name **] positive but only 1:80.
   ANCA, DSDNA, SPEP pending.  Neuro considering brain Bx but on hold
   right now b/c patient is improving.  Other CSF studies pending:
   Purkinje Antibodies, RI autoantibodies, Neuronal nuclear (Anti [**Doctor Last Name **])
   Antibody, [**Last Name (un) 4022**] antibody.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. CSF still pending for parvovirus. Blood: Final BCx negative.
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal and viral prelim
   CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is pending.  Blood: Negative
   for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV, Lyme, EBV, ehrlichia, RPR
   negative. Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**], [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: CSF HHV-6, adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV,
   coxiella, bartonella PCR, Erhlichia serology, VDRL. CSF pending: [**1-10**]
   HSV, VZV
   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin.
   - continue supportive care including seizure treatment as below
   - repeat MRI to evaluate for interval change
   - Hold on calling Neurosurg for Bx as she appears to be improving
   .
   #2 Seizures: Pt. on keppra, Phenobarbital and midazolam. Still seizing,
   but less per neuro (note says now rare, brief L frontotemporal
   seizures).  Phenobarb trough low (neuro wants 40-45, and to spread dose
   out to TID)
   - 400mg  phenobarb bolus today, 8h later start 200mg TID (start at
   10pm)
   - MRI in light of improved seizure control (if improved as well, could
   be evidence that interval MRI change was due to inadequate seizure
   control?)
   .
   #3 Intubation: No longer having apnea on SBT yesterday but unable to
   pull sufficient tidal volumes and subsequently had high RSBI
   - to wean midazolam once patient is therapeutic on phenobarbitol as per
   neuro
   - daily PSV trials
   .
   # Transaminitis: resolved
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely volume depleted w/ elevated Hct. Improved
 now
   high 90
s to low 100

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female who was transferred from another hospital with a seizure and lumbar puncture showing meningoencephalitis. The mental status is slowly improving with improved seizure control. The workup has been negative so far except for MRI progression suggesting herpetic involvement versus protracted seizures.

The patient is currently being treated with doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin. Serial MRI showed progression of inflammation consistent with herpetic involvement or prolonged seizure activity. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis has shown lymphocytosis in three tests, with the last one having fewer white blood cells. All studies are negative except for pending results for HHV-6, adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella, VDRL, and repeat HSV and VZV. The patient also has a positive ANA at 1:80, and autoimmune phenomenon or paraneoplastic syndrome is being considered.

Neurological studies are pending, including brain biopsy, and other CSF studies such as purkinje antibodies, rheumatoid arthritis factor, neuronal nuclear (Anti [Doctor Last Name]) antibody, and [Last Name (un) 4022] antibody. ID studies show negative results for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures, and blood cultures are negative for various pathogens.

   mentation and strength daily. She continues to have some episodes of
   agitation but is better. Preliminary MRI shows some improvement from
   previous imaging, but final read is still pending. LP x 3
   w/lymphocytosis, last with far fewer WBC. All studies negative so far,
   still waiting for HHV-6, adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella, VDRL.
   Repeat HSV and VZV also added on to most recent CSF studies.  Also
   considering autoimmune phenomenon or paraneoplastic syndrome.  [**Doctor First Name **]
   positive but only 1:80.  ANCA, DSDNA, SPEP pending.  Other CSF studies

   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin.
   - continue supportive care including seizure treatment as below
   - follow-up final MRI read

   #2 Seizures: Pt. on keppra, Phenobarbital and midazolam. Continues to
   have seizures but less frequently.  Phenobarb trough should be at 40-45
   per neuro. Continue with 200mg tid dosing.

   for tracheomalacia. Will open up discussion with family whether trach
   is an option at this point, given that she is still under a good deal
   of sedation. However she is clearly improving slowly and may be able to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 41-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with seizures and lumbar puncture (LP) consistent with meningoencephalitis. The patient's mental status has been slowly improving, and seizure control has also improved. MRI imaging shows some improvement, but the final read is still pending. The patient has undergone several LPs with lymphocytosis, and all studies so far have been negative. Tests for various viruses and bacteria are still pending. The patient is being considered for autoimmune phenomenon or paraneoplastic syndrome, and additional tests are being conducted to investigate this possibility. The patient is currently on doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin. Supportive care, including seizure treatment, is ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis vs Encephalitis: The patient's condition requires close monitoring for any signs of worsening neurological symptoms or development of new seizures.
2. Seizures: The patient continues to experience seizures despite being on multiple antiepileptic drugs. Adjustments to the medication regimen or additional interventions may be necessary.
3. Intubation: The patient has been intubated for two weeks, and there is concern for tracheomalacia. A discussion with the family regarding the possibility of tracheostomy is warranted. Weaning off sedation and trials of spontaneous breathing should be considered as the patient improves.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical issues. The patient underwent an MRI which showed improvement in certain areas but still had residual hyperintense lesions in the insular, frontal, and medial temporal regions. The patient has been on phenobarbital, doxycycline, ampicillin, and acyclovir, among other medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure ranging from 97/54 to 138/79 mmHg, heart rate between 78-102 bpm, respiratory rate of 12-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 86. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2 of 120 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 7.1 to 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level between 8.8 and 26.8 g/dL, platelet count between 353 and 381 K/uL, blood glucose levels between 83 and 119 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of lactate and LDH, as well as abnormalities in liver enzymes.

The patient's physical examination reveals impaired airway clearance, arousal, attention, cognition, balance, muscle performance, transfers, and ventilation. The patient also has impaired physical mobility, a history of seizure, rash, and altered mental status.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's impaired airway clearance and ventilation may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis. The altered mental status and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition could increase the risk of delirium or seizures. The presence of a rash may indicate an infection or allergic reaction. The patient's electrolyte imbalances and liver enzyme abnormalities should also be monitored closely. Additionally, the patient's impaired physical mobility and balance may increase the risk of pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or falls."

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with encephalitis who has shown improvement in her clinical and radiographic condition. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate support system. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5 C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/62 mmHg to 138/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, sedatives, and analgesics. She has been receiving IV fluids and nutrition. The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelets, and creatinine. However, her blood glucose levels are slightly elevated. The patient's neurological examination reveals that she is attentive and follows simple commands but has not been assessed for movement, tone, or reflexes. The patient's seizure activity is still present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation and is at risk of developing further respiratory complications.
2. Seizure activity: The patient continues to experience seizures, which need to be closely monitored and managed.
3. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient is still at risk of developing infections due to her critical condition and prolonged hospital stay.
4. Thromboembolic events: Given"

   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been
   negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic
   involvement vs. protracted seizures.  Several viral cultures/labs
   pending.
   .
   #1 Meningitis vs Encephalitis: She is slowly improving both in
   mentation and strength daily. She continues to have some episodes of
   agitation but is better. Preliminary MRI shows some improvement from
   previous imaging, but final read is still pending. LP x 3
   w/lymphocytosis, last with far fewer WBC. All studies negative so far,
   still waiting for HHV-6, adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella, VDRL.
   Repeat HSV and VZV also added on to most recent CSF studies.  Also
   considering autoimmune phenomenon or paraneoplastic syndrome.  [**Doctor First Name **]
   positive but only 1:80.  ANCA, DSDNA, SPEP pending.  Other CSF studies
   pending: Purkinje Antibodies, RI autoantibodies, Neuronal nuclear (Anti

   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin.
   - continue supportive care including seizure treatment as below
   - follow-up final MRI read
   - If not improving, neuro might want to do brain bx. Hold off for now

   #2 Seizures: Pt. on keppra, Phenobarbital and midazolam. Continues to
   have seizures but less frequently.  Phenobarb trough should be at 40-45
   per neuro. Continue with 200mg tid dosing.

   #3 Intubation: CPAP/PS trial today with good volume movement but low
   minute respirations. Has been intubated now for 2 weeks with concern
   for tracheomalacia. Will open up discussion with family whether trach
   is an option at this point, given that she is still under a good deal
   of sedation. However she is clearly improving slowly and may be able to
   wean off sedation by week

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) diagnosed with meningoencephalitis. She is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and there have been fewer seizures. Imaging studies show some improvement, but the final read is still pending. 

The patient's lab results indicate normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), and total bilirubin (T Bili) are also within normal limits. Electrolyte levels (Na+/K+/Cl-) are within normal range as well.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current conditions include meningitis vs encephalitis, seizures, intubation/tracheomalacia, transaminitis, tachycardia, and tube feeds (FEN). 

For the first condition, the plan is to continue doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin. Further evaluation of the CSF studies and imaging results is pending. If the patient does not improve, a brain biopsy might be considered.

For the second condition, the patient is on keppra, phenobarbital, and midazolam. The plan is to administer a 400mg phen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with impaired airway clearance, arousal, attention, and cognition. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/65 mmHg to 130/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving midazolam infusion and various medications for prophylaxis. The patient has received antibiotics including doxycycline, ampicillin, and acyclovir. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,032 mL with a total output of 2,810 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and glucose levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient has been monitored with continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent neurologic assessments due to seizure activity. The patient's physical examination findings include impaired peripheral vascular pulses, skin, and neurologic assessment. The patient's condition is stable with ongoing monitoring and treatment in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 41-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningoencephalitis. The mental status has been improving, with better seizure control. MRI imaging shows some improvement, but the final read is still pending. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies have been negative for various viruses and bacteria, except for a low titer of HSV antibodies. Blood cultures are also negative. The patient is being treated with doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin, and supportive care including seizure treatment. Further tests and evaluations are pending, including additional CSF studies, imaging, and blood tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis vs Encephalitis: The patient is slowly improving, but there is a need to wait for final imaging and test results to confirm the diagnosis. If the condition worsens or if the results indicate a more severe infection, complications such as neurological damage or sepsis may arise.
2. Seizures: Despite being on multiple antiepileptic medications, the patient continues to have seizures. If seizure control is not achieved or if the frequency increases, there is a risk of further brain damage or complications related to falls and injury.
3. Intubation: The patient has been intubated for two weeks, and there is concern about tracheomalacia. Weaning off sedation and"

   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin.
   - continue supportive care including seizure treatment as below
   - follow-up final MRI read
   - If not improving, neuro might want to do brain bx. Hold off for now

   #2 Seizures: Pt. on keppra, Phenobarbital and midazolam. Continues to
   have seizures but less frequently.  Phenobarb trough should be at 40-45
   per neuro, was 49.9 today, starting 300mg TID. Neuro aware of lab
   error, true phenobarb level. To re-check level before tomorrow am
   dose.  As per Neuro recs, Midazolam to be weaned slowly starting
   tomorrow as long as phenobarb therapeutic tomorrow am with following
   schedule: decrease by 1mg at 5am, 9am, 1pm, but no decreases after 1pm.
   Epilepsy fellow must see patient and review EEG in early afternoon
   before leaving to make sure that patient not seizing with tapering down
   of Midazolam.

   option at this point, given that she is still under a good deal of
   sedation. However she is clearly improving slowly and may be able to
   wean off sedation by week
s end.
   - will wean midazolam starting tomorrow per neuro recommended schedule.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningoencephalitis. Her mental status has been slowly improving, and she is showing signs of improved seizure control. The workup has been negative so far, with all studies showing no abnormalities. However, the repeat MRI shows some improvement from previous imaging, and final read is still pending. The patient's condition is being managed with doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin. She is also receiving supportive care, including treatment for seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis vs Encephalitis: The patient's symptoms and workup suggest a possible central nervous system infection. If the infection is not appropriately managed, it could lead to worsening of symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Seizures: The patient continues to experience seizures despite being on multiple antiepileptic medications. If seizure control is not achieved, it can increase the risk of further brain injury and complications.
3. Intubation: The patient has been intubated for two weeks due to concerns of tracheomalacia. If the trachea does not improve or if extubation fails, long-term mechanical ventilation may be required, which carries its own set of complications.
4. Transaminitis: The patient previously had transaminitis, which has since resolved. However, if it were to recur"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningoencephalitis. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and she is showing improved seizure control. Preliminary MRI results show some improvement, but final readings are still pending. The patient has undergone multiple lumbar punctures with lymphocytosis, and all studies so far have been negative. Tests for various viral cultures and antibodies are pending.

The patient is being treated with doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin. She is also receiving supportive care including treatment for seizures. The patient has been intubated for two weeks due to concerns about tracheomalacia, and discussions are being held with the family regarding the possibility of a tracheostomy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PS trials with good volume movement but low minute respirations.

Other issues include resolved transaminitis, tachycardia likely due to volume depletion, and a need for tube feeds with repletion of electrolytes as needed. The patient is also receiving prophylactic heparin, bowel regimen as needed, pneumoboots, and Zantac. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU level of care."

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including midazolam, ranitidine, and various antibiotics. Vital signs are within normal limits with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/65 mmHg to 130/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,032 mL with outputs totaling 2,810 mL. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of a rash in the perineal area, which has been treated with cream. Physical examination reveals normal heart sounds, course breath sounds bilaterally, normoactive bowel sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities without edema, and normal neurologic findings except for right-sided sternocleidomastoid muscle twitching during agitation. Labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver function tests, but elevated creatinine and lactate levels.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 41-year-old woman with encephalitis, most likely of viral origin, and status epilepticus. She has been treated with increased doses of phenobarbital to better control her seizures. However, she is now more drowsy. The respiratory failure is being managed with CPAP/PSV ventilation, but the need for spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) to determine extubation readiness will be assessed. 

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. Her last doses of antibiotics were Acyclovir, Doxycycline, and Ampicillin on 01/14/2122 at 06:01 AM, 08:00 AM, and 08:02 AM respectively. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 89 bpm with normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 111/65 mmHg to 130/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4032 mL and output of 2830 mL since midnight. Her urine output is within normal limits at 2830 mL. 

She is on midazolam infusion for sedation, as well as prophylactic heparin. Other medications include levetiracetam, micafungin, and phenobarbital.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 41-year-old woman with presumed viral encephalitis and status epilepticus. She is currently in the ICU and receiving various medications including phenobarbital, midazolam, and heparin sodium. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/65 mmHg to 130/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. However, her sodium level is slightly low at 27 mEq/L, and her potassium level is slightly elevated at 4.5 K/uL. Her blood glucose level is within normal range. Other lab values, including kidney function tests, liver enzymes, and electrolytes, are also within normal limits.

The patient's neurological examination reveals that she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. She is oriented but forgets where she is. Movement and tone assessments were not performed. The physical examination is largely unremarkable except for absent radial pulses in both arms.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation, with a set respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute and peak inspiratory pressure of"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been
   negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic
   involvement vs. protracted seizures.  Several viral cultures/labs
   pending.
   .
   #1 Meningitis vs Encephalitis: She is slowly improving both in
   mentation and strength daily. She continues to have some episodes of
   agitation and some of somnolence but is better overall. Preliminary
   read for the repeat MRI shows some improvement from previous imaging,
   but final read is still pending. LP x 3 w/lymphocytosis, last with far
   fewer WBC. All studies negative so far, still waiting for HHV-6,
   adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella, VDRL.  Repeat HSV and VZV also
   added on to most recent CSF studies, and HSV is negative.  Also
   considering autoimmune phenomenon or paraneoplastic syndrome.  [**Doctor First Name **]
   positive but only 1:80.  ANCA, DSDNA, SPEP all negative as well.
   Paraneoplastic syndrome CSF studies are still pending: Purkinje
   Antibodies, RI autoantibodies, Neuronal nuclear (Anti [**Doctor Last Name **]) Antibody,
   [**Last Name (un) 4022**] antibody.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. Parvovirus test not complete due to miscommunication between
   state lab and [**Location (un) **].  Blood: Final BCx negative.
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, adenovirus, Lyme, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal
   and viral prelim CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is
   pending.  Blood: Negative for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV,
   Lyme, EBV, ehrlichia, RPR negative. Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**],
   [**1-1**].

   IgG IgM, parvo DNA, WNV.
   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin.
   - continue supportive care including seizure treatment as below
   - follow-up final MRI read
   - If not improving, neuro might want to do brain bx. Hold off for now
   .
   #2 Seizures: Pt. on keppra, Phenobarbital and midazolam. Continues to
   have seizures but less frequently.  Phenobarb trough should be at 40-45
   per neuro, was 49.9 today, starting 300mg TID. Neuro aware of lab
   error, true phenobarb level. To re-check level before tomorrow am
   dose.  As per Neuro recs, Midazolam to be weaned slowly starting
   tomorrow as long as phenobarb therapeutic tomorrow am with following
   schedule: decrease by 1mg at 5am, 9am, 1pm, but no decreases after 1pm.
   Epilepsy fellow must see patient and review EEG in early afternoon
   before leaving to make sure that patient not seizing with tapering down
   of Midazolam.
   - f/u final MRI read
   -f/u neuro/EP recs

   #3 Intubation: Had been on MMV/PSV since yesterday 10am w/out any
   periods of apnea. Has been intubated now for 2 weeks with concern for
   tracheomalacia. Will open up discussion with family whether trach is an
   option at this point, given that she is still under a good deal of
   sedation. However she is clearly improving slowly and may be able to
   wean off sedation by week
s end.
   - will wean midazolam starting tomorrow per neuro recommended schedule.
   - wean pressure support/PEEP as needed. Goal is [**9-16**] today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU with seizure and lumbar puncture findings consistent with meningoencephalitis. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and there has been an improvement in seizure control. Preliminary MRI results show some improvement compared to previous imaging, although the final read is still pending. The patient has had multiple negative tests, including viral cultures, blood cultures, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies. However, some tests are still pending. The patient is being treated with doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin. The patient also has a tracheostomy and has been intubated for two weeks due to concerns of tracheomalacia. There is a discussion about the possibility of tracheostomy placement. The patient's phenobarbital level is elevated, so the dose will be adjusted. Midazolam will be weaned off slowly. The patient's seizures are being managed with keppra, phenobarbital, and midazolam. The patient's other medical issues, such as transaminitis, tachycardia, and feeding tube placement, have resolved. The patient is currently on full code status and requires continued ICU level of care.

   but final read is still pending. LP x 3 w/lymphocytosis, last with far
   fewer WBC. All studies negative so far, still waiting for HHV-6,
   adenovirus, WNV, EEE, LCMV, coxiella, VDRL.  Repeat HSV and VZV also
   added on to most recent CSF studies, and HSV is negative.  Also
   considering autoimmune phenomenon or paraneoplastic syndrome.  [**Doctor First Name **]

   - continue doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin.
   - continue supportive care including seizure treatment as below
   - follow-up final MRI read
   - If not improving, neuro might want to do brain bx. Hold off for now
   .
   #2 Seizures: Pt. on keppra, Phenobarbital and midazolam. Continues to
   have seizures but less frequently.  Phenobarb trough should be at 40-45
   per neuro, was 49.9 today, starting 300mg TID. Neuro aware of lab
   error, true phenobarb level. To re-check level before tomorrow am
   dose.  As per Neuro recs, Midazolam to be weaned slowly starting
   tomorrow as long as phenobarb therapeutic tomorrow am with following
   schedule: decrease by 1mg at 5am, 9am, 1pm, but no decreases after 1pm.
   Epilepsy fellow must see patient and review EEG in early afternoon
   before leaving to make sure that patient not seizing with tapering down

   option at this point, given that she is still under a good deal of
   sedation. However she is clearly improving slowly and may be able to
   wean off sedation by week

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) consistent with meningoencephalitis. The patient's mental status has been slowly improving, along with improved seizure control. Preliminary results of the repeat MRI show some improvement compared to the previous imaging, but the final read is still pending. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies have been negative for several viruses and bacteria. The patient's blood cultures are also negative. Further testing is pending, including CSF and blood tests for HHV-6, adenovirus, West Nile virus (WNV), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), LCMV, coxiella, and VDRL. The patient's phenobarbital level is high, and the dosage will be adjusted accordingly. Midazolam will be weaned slowly, and the patient's tracheostomy will be discussed with the family. The patient's electrolytes and fluids will be managed appropriately. The patient's condition is improving slowly, and she may be able to wean off sedation by the end of the week."

The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningoencephalitis. Her mental status has been slowly improving, and she is showing signs of improved seizure control. An MRI showed some improvement from previous imaging, which is consistent with improved seizure control or treatment for encephalitis/meningitis. The patient is still awaiting several lab studies to determine the cause of her symptoms, including autoimmune phenomenon or paraneoplastic syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis vs Encephalitis: The patient may experience further episodes of agitation, possible seizure activity, and somnolence including short periods of apnea. It is important to closely monitor her mental status and seizure control.
2. Seizures: Despite being on multiple anti-seizure medications, the patient continues to have seizures. It is necessary to adjust the dosage of phenobarbital and continue supportive care.
3. Intubation: The patient has been intubated for two weeks due to concerns about tracheomalacia. There is a discussion about the possibility of tracheostomy if she does not improve. Weaning off sedation is planned by the end of the week.
4. Transaminitis: The patient previously experienced transaminitis, but it has since resolved.
5. Tachycardia: The patient previously had tachycardia, but it has since"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, which showed significant clogging of the endotracheal tube by hardened secretions. The tube was changed without any problems.
- The patient's parvo B19 IgG and IgM levels are positive, indicating a past or recent infection with parvovirus B19. The PCR test result is still pending.
- The patient's midazolam infusion has been weaned down to 12 mg/hour overnight (possibly 11 mg/hour by rounds).
- It is being considered to call the intensivist in the morning for possible tracheostomy on Monday if the patient is unable to be weaned from the ventilator.
- The patient's lab results are largely within normal limits, except for slightly elevated levels of lactate, amylase, and lipase.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining proper airway hygiene and regularly assessing for signs of infection.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Prophylactic measures such as early mobilization and compression stockings should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been
   negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic
   involvement vs. protracted seizures.  Several viral cultures/labs
   pending.
   .
   #1 Meningitis vs Encephalitis: She is slowly improving both in
   mentation and strength daily. She continues to have some episodes of
   agitation with possible seizure activity and some of somnolence
   including short periods of apnea but is better overall. Repeat MRI
   showed some improvement from previous imaging, consistent with improved
   seizure control v treatment for encephalitis/meningitis. LP x 3
   w/lymphocytosis, last with far fewer WBC. All studies negative for
   active infection so far, although still awaiting several studies (see
   list below).  Repeat HSV and VZV also added on to most recent CSF
   studies and HSV is negative.  Also considering autoimmune phenomenon or
   paraneoplastic syndrome.  [**Doctor First Name **] positive but only 1:80.  ANCA, DSDNA,
   SPEP, Ro/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] negative as well.  Paraneoplastic syndrome CSF studies
   are still pending: Purkinje Antibodies, RI autoantibodies, Neuronal
   nuclear (Anti [**Doctor Last Name **]) Antibody, [**Last Name (un) 4022**] antibody. Doxycycline d/c b/c coxiella
   negative.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. Parvovirus test not complete due to miscommunication between
   state lab and [**Location (un) **].  Blood: Final BCx negative.
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, adenovirus, Lyme, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal
   and viral prelim CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is
   pending.  Blood: Negative for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV,
   Lyme, EBV, ehrlichia, RPR negative. Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**],
   [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: CSF: HHV-6, EEE, WNV, VZV, parvovirus,
   arbovirus, VDRL. Blood pending: bartonella PCR, EEE, LCMV, parvovirus
   IgG IgM, parvo DNA, WNV.
   - continue acyclovir, and ampicillin.
   - d/w neuro length of treatment w/acyclovir
   - continue supportive care including seizure treatment as below
   .
   #2 Seizures: Pt. on keppra, Phenobarbital and midazolam. Continues to
   have seizures but less frequently.  Phenobarb trough should be at 40-45
   per neuro, was >50 today, continuing 300mg TID as per neuro.  As per
   Neuro recs, Midazolam to be weaned slowly starting today with following
   schedule: decrease by 1mg at 5am, 9am, 1pm, but no decreases after 1pm.
   Epilepsy fellow  and/or attending to see patient and review EEG in
   early afternoon before leaving to make sure that patient not seizing
   with tapering down of Midazolam.
   - taper midazolam tomorrow as per above schedule
   - f/u neuro/EP recs
   .
   #3 Intubation: Was on PSV yesterday and had 5 second period of apnea
   w/possible seizure(?). Has been intubated now for 2 weeks with concern
   for tracheomalacia. Has been discussing with family whether trach is an
   option at this point, given that she is still under a good deal of
   sedation. However she is clearly improving slowly and will hopefully be
   able to be weaned off sedation by week
s end.  Habituation to sedation
   effects of phenobarbitol will also help with patient
s mental status
   and may decrease the periods of apnea.
   - allow patient to stay on PSV as long as not apnic
   - will wean midazolam starting today per neuro recommended schedule.
   - wean pressure support/PEEP as needed. Goal is [**6-16**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) consistent with meningoencephalitis. Her mental status is slowly improving, and she is showing signs of improved seizure control. Repeat MRI shows improvement from previous imaging. The patient's labs indicate negative results for HSV and VZV, but further studies are pending. She is currently on doxycycline, acyclovir, and ampicillin, and additional antibiotics may be considered if necessary. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.2°F, heart rate ranging from 83-102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/73-120/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Her neurological examination reveals normal pupillary responses, decreased extraocular movements bilaterally, and no motor or sensory deficits. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a plan to wean her off sedation by the end of the week. She is also on phenobarbital for seizure control, and midazolam will be weaned starting today. Tracheostomy may be considered if the patient is unable to be weaned from the ventilator. The patient's electrolytes and renal function are within normal limits. She is at risk for complications such as pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been
   negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic
   involvement vs. protracted seizures.  Several viral cultures/labs
   pending.
   .
   #1 Seizures: Parvo b19 positive on IgG and IgM which would explain her
   seizures as well as her transaminitis and malaise/flu-like symptoms
   prior to her decline. Per neuro will continue Phenobarbital tid with
   goal of 40-50, and slowly wean off midazolam. Per EEG has not had any
   seizure activity for 24hrs. She still has pending labs, incl blood
   cultures, that will need to be followed up (see below). Per ID, we will
   try to add on parvo abs and PCR to her samples from earlier in the
   admission to see if we can confirm parvo infection over the course of
   the illness.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. Parvovirus positive.  Blood: Final BCx negative.
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, adenovirus, Lyme, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal
   and viral prelim CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is
   pending.  Blood: Negative for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV,
   Lyme, EBV, ehrlichia, RPR negative. Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**],
   [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: CSF: HHV-6, EEE, WNV, VZV, parvovirus,
   arbovirus, VDRL. Blood pending: bartonella PCR, EEE, LCMV, parvovirus
   IgG IgM, parvo DNA, WNV. Parvo antibody and PCR on blood sample and CSF
   from admission sample.
   - continue acyclovir, and ampicillin until all labs are back.
   - continue wean off versed and continue phenobarbatol
   - continue keppra
   -f/u neuro, EP recs
   .
   #2 Intubation: Has been able to tolerate [**11-16**] on PS well, but tires out
   after a while. She continues to have apneic episodes but the length is
   decreasing with improved mental status. The hope is to wean off
   midazolam over the next couple of days and move toward extubation.
   - allow patient to stay on PSV as long as not apneic
   - wean versed per neuro recs
   - wean pressure support/PEEP as needed. Goal is [**6-16**].

","The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizure and lumbar puncture, presenting with meningoencephalitis. The patient's mental status has been slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic involvement vs. protracted seizures. Several viral cultures/labs are pending.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/73 mmHg to 120/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 380 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 17 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 14 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 85.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake, alert, and interactive with decreased eye movement bilaterally. The cardiovascular system is normal, with regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, or gallops. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and nondistended. There is no edema observed in the extremities. Neurological examination shows normal reflexes in the upper and lower extremities,"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo female admit s/p seizure and now with persistent respiratory
   failure in the setting of ongoing Rx for seizures now with provocative
   findings of parvovirus positive by IgG and IgM.  She has had prolonged
   course of ventilatory support in the setting of ongoing management of
   intermittent seizures.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Continued support now delivered through ETT now
   changed.  She has minimal requirements for support with limited
   secretions noted on regular exam.  This is likely continued respiratory
   failure attributable in large part to persistent mental
   status/respiratory drive issues with caution needed in the setting of
   ongoing high doses of sedating medications.
   -RSBI each morning
   -SBT and extubation if mental status favorable as medications weaned
   down.
   -Trach discussed but will hold given overall clinical improvement
   2)Seizure-

   -Versed 10mg/hr
wean down by 3mg/hr/day to wean to off
   -Phenobarbitol 300mg tid

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female admitted for a seizure and persistent respiratory failure. She has been on ventilatory support and is currently managed for intermittent seizures. Recent findings indicate that the patient is positive for parvovirus B19 by IgM and IgG. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to mental status/respiratory drive issues, and there is caution needed while weaning down sedating medications.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure:
- Continued support through endotracheal tube (ETT) change.
- Monitor RSBI each morning.
- Perform spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and consider extubation if mental status is favorable while medications are weaned down.
- Hold tracheostomy discussion for now due to overall clinical improvement.

2. Seizure:
- Continue with Keppra, Versed 10mg/hr weaning down by 3mg/hr/day, and Phenobarbital 300mg tid.
- Monitor with EEG as Versed weans down to track possible seizure activity.

3. Meningitis/Encephalitis:
- Complete course of Acyclovir, Ampicillin, and consider ID consultation in light of new positive findings on serologies.

Potential Medical Complications:
- Impaired airway clearance due to respiratory failure.
- Impaired arousal, attention, cognition, balance, knowledge, muscle performance, and ventilation due to prolonged sedation and mechanical ventilation.
- Risk of"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been
   negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic
   involvement vs. protracted seizures.  Several viral cultures/labs
   pending.
   .
   #1 Seizures: Parvo b19 positive on IgG and IgM which would explain her
   seizures as well as her transaminitis and malaise/flu-like symptoms
   prior to her decline. Per neuro will continue Phenobarbital tid with
   goal of 40-50, and slowly wean off midazolam. Per EEG has not had any
   seizure activity for 24hrs. She still has pending labs, incl blood
   cultures, that will need to be followed up (see below). Per ID, we will
   try to add on parvo abs and PCR to her samples from earlier in the
   admission to see if we can confirm parvo infection over the course of
   the illness.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. Parvovirus positive.  Blood: Final BCx negative.
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, adenovirus, Lyme, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal
   and viral prelim CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is
   pending.  Blood: Negative for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV,
   Lyme, EBV, ehrlichia, RPR negative. Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**],
   [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: CSF: HHV-6, EEE, WNV, VZV, parvovirus,
   arbovirus, VDRL. Blood pending: bartonella PCR, EEE, LCMV, parvovirus
   IgG IgM, parvo DNA, WNV. Parvo antibody and PCR on blood sample and CSF
   from admission sample.
   - continue acyclovir, and ampicillin until all labs are back.
   - continue wean off versed and continue phenobarbatol
   - continue keppra
   -f/u neuro, EP recs
   .
   #2 Intubation: Has been able to tolerate [**11-16**] on PS well, but tires out
   after a while. She continues to have apneic episodes but the length is
   decreasing with improved mental status. The hope is to wean off
   midazolam over the next couple of days and move toward extubation.
   - allow patient to stay on PSV as long as not apneic
   - wean versed per neuro recs
   - wean pressure support/PEEP as needed. Goal is [**6-16**].
   -IP curbside in case we need to trach next week

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizure and lumbar puncture, who was transferred from OSH with meningoencephalitis. Mental status has slowly improved, and seizure control is better.
- Workup has been negative except for MRI findings suggesting herpetic involvement or prolonged seizures. Viral cultures and labs are pending.
- The patient is positive for Parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM, which explains her seizures, transaminitis, and flu-like symptoms prior to her decline.
- Phenobarbital will be continued at a dose of 40-50 mg three times a day, and midazolam will be weaned off. EEG shows no seizure activity for the past 24 hours.
- ID studies indicate that CSF is positive for Parvovirus B19, while blood cultures are negative.
- Other pending labs include CSF tests for HHV-6, EEE, WNV, VZV, parvovirus, arbovirus, and VDRL, as well as blood tests for Bartonella PCR, EEE, LCMV, parvovirus IgG and IgM, parvo DNA, and WNV.
- The patient will continue on acyclovir and ampicillin until all labs are back.
- Weaning off versed and continuing phenobarbital will be done, along with continuing keppra.
- Neuro and EP recommendations will be followed.
- Intubation: The patient has been tolerating pressure support well, but tires out after a while. Apneic episodes are decreasing with improved mental status.
- The goal is to wean off midazolam over the next couple of days and move towards extubation.
- PSV will be allowed as long as there is no apnea, and pressure support/PEEP will be weaned as needed, aiming for a goal of 6-16.
- In case of the need for tracheostomy next week, IP curbside has been arranged.
- Transaminitis has resolved, likely due to parvo infection.
- Tachycardia has resolved.
- FEN (tube feeds) will be initiated, with replete lytes PRN and free water boluses decreased to 125cc every 6 hours.
- Bowel regimen PRN, pneumoboots, and Zantac will be administered.

   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been
   negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic
   involvement vs. protracted seizures.
   .
   #1 Seizures: Likely parvovirus B19 meningioencephalitis given recent
   positive IgG and IgM which would explain her seizures as well as her
   transaminitis and malaise/flu-like symptoms prior to her decline. Per
   neuro will continue Phenobarbital tid with goal of 40-50, and slowly
   wean off midazolam. Pending labs include blood culture, CSF studies.
   ID studies:

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) indicating meningoencephalitis. Her mental status has been improving, but she still experiences apneic episodes while on CPAP/PSV. The workup has been negative except for MRI findings suggestive of herpetic involvement. 

Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient is likely experiencing seizures due to parvovirus B19 meningioencephalitis. She has been prescribed phenobarbital to be taken three times a day with the goal of maintaining a level between 40-50. The plan is to slowly wean off midazolam.
2. Intubation: The patient is currently intubated and tolerating pressure support well. However, she continues to have apneic episodes during sleep, which may be secondary to high levels of phenobarbital and sedation. The goal is to wean off midazolam and move towards extubation.
3. Transaminitis: The patient had resolved transaminitis, likely related to parvo infection.
4. FEN (tube feeds): The patient requires tube feeds. Her electrolytes should be monitored and corrected as needed. Free water boluses will be given, and insulin will be discontinued since she hasn't needed it in over four days.
5. PPX (preoperative prophylaxis): The"

   .
   #1 Seizures: All tests negative so far except parvovirus B19 IgG, IgM.
   Parvo may be causing  meningioencephalitis given recent positive IgG
   and IgM which would explain her seizures as well as her transaminitis
   and malaise/flu-like symptoms prior to her decline. Repeat [**Last Name (un) 4150**] titers
   from [**12-31**] pending. Per neuro will continue Phenobarbital tid with goal
   of 40-50, and slowly wean off midazolam. Pending labs include blood
   culture, CSF studies.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. Parvovirus positive.  Blood: Final BCx negative.

   - continue acyclovir for 3 weeks,
   - d/c ampicillin  since CSF cx from [**1-10**] returned final NG
   - continue wean off versed per neuro protocol. Continue to decrease by

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with no significant past medical history who was admitted to the ICU for seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) due to meningoencephalitis. Mental status has been improving, and seizure control has improved as well. Workup so far has been negative except for positive parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM, suggesting a possible viral infection causing the meningioencephalitis. The patient is currently on phenobarbital, midazolam, and levetiracetam for seizure management. Blood and CSF cultures are pending, along with further ID studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient continues to experience seizures despite being on multiple antiepileptic drugs. Repeat parvovirus B19 titers are pending to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had episodes of apnea while on mechanical ventilation, which could be secondary to high levels of phenobarbital and sedation. The patient has been extubated, but there was immediate stridor post-extubation. Racemic epinephrine was given, and the stridor improved. Close monitoring will be done to assess respiratory function and determine if re-intubation is necessary.
3. Transaminitis: The patient had elevated liver enzymes, but they have now resolved. This may be related to the parvovirus infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been
   negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic
   involvement vs. protracted seizures.
   .
   #1 Seizures: Likely parvovirus B19 meningioencephalitis given recent
   positive IgG and IgM which would explain her seizures as well as her
   transaminitis and malaise/flu-like symptoms prior to her decline. Per
   neuro will continue Phenobarbital tid with goal of 40-50, and slowly
   wean off midazolam. Pending labs include blood culture, CSF studies.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. Parvovirus positive.  Blood: Final BCx negative.
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, adenovirus, Lyme, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal
   and viral prelim CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is
   pending.  Blood: Negative for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV,
   Lyme, EBV, ehrlichia, RPR negative. Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**],

   arbovirus, VDRL. Blood pending: bartonella PCR, EEE, LCMV, parvovirus
   IgG IgM, parvo DNA, WNV.
   - continue acyclovir for 3 weeks, and ampicillin until  CSF cx from

   #2 Intubation: Has been able to tolerate [**11-16**] on PS well, but continues
   to have apneic episodes at times during sleep. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to high
   levels of phenobarb and sedation. The hope is to wean off midazolam
   over the next couple of days and move toward extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. She presented with seizures and had a lumbar puncture (LP) that was consistent with the diagnosis. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and seizure control has been achieved. Initial workup showed negative results for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, and bacterial cultures in the CSF. However, the CSF was positive for parvovirus B19, which is suggestive of parvovirus B19 meningioencephalitis. Blood cultures have also been negative. The patient is currently on acyclovir, ampicillin, phenobarbital, and midazolam. Plans include continuing acyclovir for another three weeks and ampicillin until the CSF culture results return. The weaning off midazolam will be done per neurologic recommendations. The patient's intubation status is being monitored, and she is tolerating pressure support well but continues to have apneic episodes during sleep. Extubation is planned once the sedation level decreases. The patient's transaminitis has resolved, likely related to the parvovirus infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been
   negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic
   involvement vs. protracted seizures.
   .
   #1 Seizures: All tests negative so far except parvovirus B19 IgG, IgM.
   Parvo may be causing  meningioencephalitis given recent positive IgG
   and IgM which would explain her seizures as well as her transaminitis
   and malaise/flu-like symptoms prior to her decline. Repeat [**Last Name (un) 4150**] titers
   from [**12-31**] pending. Per neuro will continue Phenobarbital tid with goal
   of 40-50, and slowly wean off midazolam. Pending labs include blood
   culture, CSF studies.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. Parvovirus positive.  Blood: Final BCx negative.
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, adenovirus, Lyme, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal
   and viral prelim CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is
   pending.  Blood: Negative for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV,
   Lyme, EBV, ehrlichia, RPR negative. Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**],
   [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: CSF: HHV-6, EEE, WNV, VZV, parvovirus,
   arbovirus, VDRL. Blood pending: bartonella PCR, EEE, LCMV, parvovirus
   IgG IgM, parvo DNA, WNV.
   - continue acyclovir for 3 weeks,
   - d/c ampicillin  CSF cx from [**1-10**] returned final NG
   - continue wean off versed per neuro protocol. Continue to decrease by
   1, at 5am, 9am, 1pm. Will be at 3mg today, advance to completely off
   [**1-18**]. If presistant seizures during titration can bolus versed and go
   back up 1mg.
   - continue keppra, phenobarb for level in 40s
   -given seizure last evening continue phenobarb at current dose (despite
   level at 54.9)  getting pre-dose levels. If reach 60 can miss 2 doses
   of phenobarb and decrease dose to 200mg TID
   -f/u neuro and ID recs
   .
   #2 Resp failure: Has been able to tolerate [**11-16**] on PS well,  apneic
   episodes decreasing. Episodes [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to high levels of
   phenobarb and sedation. Since pt awake on low dose midazolam ,
   extubation.
   - wean versed per neuro recs
   - wean pressure support/PEEP as needed. Goal is [**6-16**].
   .
   # Transaminitis: resolved- likely related to parvo infection.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with seizure and lumbar puncture findings consistent with meningoencephalitis.
- She has been improving slowly with improved seizure control and mental status.
- Workup has been negative except for positive parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM, suggesting a possible viral infection causing meningioencephalitis.
- She is currently on phenobarbital for seizure control, and the dose needs to be adjusted based on blood levels.
- The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) well and was successfully extubated.
- However, she experienced significant stridor afterwards and is now on bipap support.
- She has been weaned off midazolam sedation per neurology recommendations.
- The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to high levels of phenobarbital and sedation. She will continue to be weaned off versed and pressure support/PEEP as needed.
- Her transaminitis has resolved, likely related to parvo infection.
- The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is receiving tube feeds. She also requires free water boluses and has been disconnected from insulin supplementation.
- She is on heparin subcutaneously for thrombosis prevention and bowel regimen as needed.
- The patient has a PICC line for medication administration.
- Her code status is full code, and she requires ICU level of care.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male who presented to the ICU with altered mental status, seizure activity, and a rash. The patient's condition is critical, as indicated by his need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, suggesting septic shock. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, suggesting an ongoing infection and tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by the elevated creatinine level. The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged PT and PTT, indicating a possible coagulopathy.

The patient's medical history includes recent antibiotic use for an infection, which may be contributing to his current condition. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation and lab results suggest an ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's MODS indicates dysfunction in multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, and possibly the lungs.
3. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT and PTT suggest a possible coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.

   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Mental status appears to
   be slowly improving with improved seizure control. Workup has been
   negative so far other than MRI progression being suggestive of herpetic
   involvement vs. protracted seizures.
   .
   #1 Seizures: Likely parvovirus B19 meningioencephalitis given recent
   positive IgG and IgM which would explain her seizures as well as her
   transaminitis and malaise/flu-like symptoms prior to her decline. Per
   neuro will continue Phenobarbital tid with goal of 40-50, and slowly
   wean off midazolam. Pending labs include blood culture, CSF studies.
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who was transferred to the ICU with a seizure and lumbar puncture consistent with meningoencephalitis. The patient's mental status has been slowly improving with improved seizure control. The workup has been negative, except for an MRI showing progression suggestive of herpetic involvement or protracted seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient is likely experiencing seizures due to parvovirus B19 meningioencephalitis. The phenobarbital dose needs to be adjusted to maintain levels between 40-50, and midazolam should be slowly weaned off.
2. Intubation: The patient continues to have apneic episodes during sleep, possibly due to high levels of phenobarbital and sedation. It is recommended to wean off midazolam and move towards extubation once the sedation decreases.
3. Transaminitis: The transaminitis has resolved, likely related to the parvo infection.
4. Tube feeds: The patient may require tube feeds due to replete lytes PRN and free water boluses.
5. Heparin sc, bowel regimen prn, pneumoboots, and Zantac are also part of the patient's care plan.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. She presented with seizures and a lumbar puncture (LP) that confirmed the diagnosis. The initial workup was negative except for positive parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM, suggesting a possible viral infection causing the meningitis and seizures. She has been treated with acyclovir, phenobarbital, and midazolam. Her mental status is slowly improving, and she is showing signs of seizure control. 

The patient has been extubated after tolerating pressure support well and experiencing a decrease in apneic episodes. However, she had stridor immediately after extubation, which improved with racemic epinephrine. She is currently on high-flow oxygen and being closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress or the need for reintubation.

Other findings include transaminitis, which has resolved likely related to the parvovirus infection. She is on tube feeds and free water due to intubation, and her electrolytes are being replenished as needed. Insulin was discontinued since she had not required it in over 4 days. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin, bowel regimen, pneumoboots, and Zantac. The patient has a PICC line in place, and her code status is full code. She will continue to receive ICU level of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with seizures and lumbar puncture findings consistent with meningoencephalitis. The patient has been improving daily since extubation and is now only on acyclovir for microbial coverage. Several other tests are still pending. 

The patient's main issues include:
1. Seizures: Thought to be due to parvovirus B19, although other tests are still pending. The patient has been on Phenobarbital and keppra, and the neuro service plans to continue these medications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient did well post-extubation and is now on room air. She will continue to be monitored, and NC and bipap will be offered if she goes into distress.
3. Transaminitis: This issue has resolved, likely related to the parvo infection.
4. FEN (likely referring to feeding): The patient should advance her diet as tolerated.
5. PPX (likely referring to prophylaxis): The patient is receiving heparin subcutaneously, a bowel regimen as needed, pneumoboots, and Zantac.
6. Access: The patient has a PICC line in place.
7. Code status: Full code.
8. Disposition: The patient will be monitored, and if she does well today, she will be transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, seizures, and a rash. Upon extubation, the patient had significant stridor but maintained good oxygen saturation. Racemic epinephrine nebulizer and bipap were administered, followed by high-flow O2 on a face tent. Over the next few hours, the patient's oxygen requirement decreased and stridor improved. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction due to swelling or edema.
2. Respiratory distress or failure due to decreased oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Infection or sepsis secondary to the rash and altered immune response.
4. Neurological complications such as status epilepticus or prolonged altered mental status.
5. Bleeding or clotting disorders indicated by abnormal coagulation studies.
6. Fluid imbalance or electrolyte disturbances due to ongoing fluid resuscitation and renal dysfunction.
7. Possible underlying cardiac issues given the history of hypertension and current tachycardia.
8. Pressure injuries or immobility complications due to impaired physical mobility.
9. Potential medication side effects or interactions given the multiple medications being administered.
10. Complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation if required."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Now s/p extubation and
   improving daily. Thus far studies positive only for parvovirus b19,
   with several other labs pending.
   .
   #1 Seizures: Thought to be due to parvovirus B19, although several
   tests (including EEE, bartonella) still pending.  Since extubation she
   has not had any seizure activity on EEG although continues to have
   twitching in her R SCM at times. Per neuro service, will continue to
   dose Phenobarbital to 40-50, continue keppra. At this time she is only
   on acyclovir for microbial coverage, tomorrow being her last day of
   treatment. Ampicillin was stopped yesterday given negative CSF
   cultures. Her goal for today is to be off midazolam drip
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. Parvovirus positive.  Blood: Final BCx negative.
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, adenovirus, Lyme, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal
   and viral prelim CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is
   pending.  Blood: Negative for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV,
   Lyme, EBV, ehrlichia, RPR negative. Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**],
   [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: CSF: HHV-6, EEE, WNV, VZV, parvovirus,
   arbovirus, VDRL. Blood pending: bartonella PCR, EEE, LCMV, parvovirus
   IgG IgM, parvo DNA, WNV.
   - acyclovir d/c tomorrow
   - continue to wean off versed. If presistant seizures during titration
   can bolus versed and go back up by 1mg.
   - continue keppra, [**Hospital1 4170**] for level in 40s
   -continue [**Hospital1 4170**]. Given level over 60 will hold 2 doses of [**Hospital1 4170**]
   and decrease dose to 200mg TID
   -f/u neuro and ID recs
   -PT/OT today
   -FYI : patient is on fluconazole for perineal rash, which may affect
   her [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4170**] [**Last Name (un) **] and other meds cleared by liver.
   .
   #2 Resp failure: Doing well s/p extubation. Will continue to monitor
   her tachypnea (likely due to anxiety). She is maintaining good
   saturdation and no longer has any stridor. Currently on room air, will
   offer NC and bipap if she goes into distress. She refused to be
   reintubated yesterday after a brief period of distress post-extubation,
   which was relieved w/bipap and racemic epi.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) indicating meningoencephalitis. The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation but is now extubated and improving daily. She has tested positive for parvovirus B19, and other tests are still pending. The patient is being treated with acyclovir for microbial coverage, and her goal for today is to be off midazolam drip.

The patient's medical complications include seizures, respiratory failure, transaminitis, and impaired physical mobility. The seizures are thought to be due to parvovirus B19 infection, although tests for other pathogens are still pending. The patient is currently on phenobarbital and keppra for seizure management. The respiratory failure was likely caused by anxiety, but the patient is doing well post-extubation and maintaining good oxygen saturation. She is currently on room air and will be offered non-invasive ventilation if needed.

The transaminitis has resolved, likely related to the parvo infection. The patient's impaired physical mobility may be due to the meningoencephalitis and is currently unable to perform transfers, muscle performance, and impaired balance.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. She has received antibiotics, specifically ampicillin on 01/18/2022 at 09:16 AM, and acyclovir on 01/20/"

   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Now s/p extubation and
   improving daily. Thus far studies positive only for parvovirus b19,
   with several other labs pending.
   .
   #1 Seizures: Thought to be due to parvovirus B19, although several
   tests (including EEE, bartonella) still pending.  Since extubation she
   has not had any seizure activity on EEG although continues to have
   twitching in her R SCM at times. Per neuro service, will continue to
   dose Phenobarbital to 40-50, continue keppra. At this time she is only
   on acyclovir for microbial coverage, tomorrow being her last day of
   treatment. Ampicillin was stopped yesterday given negative CSF
   cultures. Her goal for today is to be off midazolam drip
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. Parvovirus positive.  Blood: Final BCx negative.
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, adenovirus, Lyme, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal
   and viral prelim CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is
   pending.  Blood: Negative for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV,
   Lyme, EBV, ehrlichia, RPR negative. Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**],
   [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: CSF: HHV-6, EEE, WNV, VZV, parvovirus,
   arbovirus, VDRL. Blood pending: bartonella PCR, EEE, LCMV, parvovirus
   IgG IgM, parvo DNA, WNV.
   - acyclovir d/c tomorrow
   - continue to wean off versed. If presistant seizures during titration
   can bolus versed and go back up by 1mg.
   - continue keppra, [**Hospital1 4170**] for level in 40s

   #2 Resp failure: Doing well s/p extubation. Will continue to monitor
   her tachypnea (likely due to anxiety). She is maintaining good
   saturdation and no longer has any stridor. Currently on room air, will
   offer NC and bipap if she goes into distress. She refused to be
   reintubated yesterday after a brief period of distress post-extubation,
   which was relieved w/bipap and racemic epi.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizures and lumbar puncture consistent with meningoencephalitis. She was transferred from another hospital and is now in the ICU.
- The patient has been improving daily since being extubated.
- She tested positive for parvovirus B19 in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but other tests including EEE, Bartonella, and bacterial cultures were negative.
- The patient's seizures were initially thought to be due to parvovirus B19, but further tests are pending.
- The patient has been on acyclovir for microbial coverage, which will be discontinued tomorrow.
- She is currently on phenobarbital and levetiracetam (Kendra) for seizure management.
- The patient's respiratory failure is resolving well after extubation. She is maintaining good oxygen saturation and no longer has stridor. She will continue to be monitored, and non-invasive ventilation options will be offered if needed.
- The patient's transaminitis has resolved, likely related to the parvovirus infection.
- The patient's advanced diet as tolerated and will continue to be repleted with electrolytes as needed.
- She has been given prophylactic heparin, bowel regimen as needed, pneumoboots, and ranitidine (Zantac).
- The patient's PICC line was placed on [**2122-1-3**] at 04:00 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and although they have not occurred recently, there is still a possibility of further seizure activity. The neurology service will continue to monitor the patient's seizure management.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure is improving, there is still a risk of respiratory distress. Monitoring will continue, and non-invasive ventilation options will be available if needed.
3. Transaminitis: The patient had resolved transaminitis, which could potentially recur if there are ongoing liver issues.
4. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient has impaired physical mobility, which may increase the risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pressure ulcers.
5. Rash: The patient has a rash, which may be due to the fluconazole medication. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management of the rash.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may affect her ability to communicate and make decisions. Close monitoring and appropriate supportive care will be provided.
7. Potential Infections: Although the patient's current ID studies are negative, there are still pending tests for other infections such as HHV-6, EEE, WNV, VZV, arbovirus, and Bartonella. These results will be closely monitored for any signs of infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU. The patient has been receiving various medications, including phenobarbital, acyclovir, ranitidine, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and ativan. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/60-136/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on respiratory support with no oxygen delivery device. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.26, pCO2 26 mmHg, and bicarbonate 18 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals normal peripheral vascular pulses, normal skin, and unassessed neurologic status. The patient has impaired airway clearance, balance, knowledge, muscle performance, transfers, and ventilation. The patient also has impaired physical mobility and a rash. The patient's mental status is altered but not delirium.

Lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 4.3-8.2 K/uL, hematocrit ranging from 24.0-27.8%, platelet count ranging from 282-315 K/uL, creatinine ranging from 0.4-0.5 mg/dL, glucose ranging from 83-118 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient has experienced seizure activity overnight, which may require ongoing monitoring and management with antiepileptic drugs.
2. Impaired airway clearance: The patient has impaired airway clearance, which can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
3. Impaired balance and mobility: The patient has impaired balance and mobility, increasing the risk of falls and potential injuries.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be indicative of an underlying infection, medication side effects, or another neurological condition. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary.
5. Impaired muscle performance: The patient's impaired muscle performance may lead to muscle weakness and decreased ability to perform activities of daily living.
6. RASH: The presence of a rash may indicate an allergic reaction or an infection. Further assessment is required to determine the cause and appropriate management.
7. Potential medication complications: The patient is on multiple medications, including phenobarbital, acyclovir, ranitidine, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and ativan. Each of these medications has its own potential side effects and complications that need to be monitored and managed.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management of the patient."

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU with seizure and lumbar puncture (LP) consistent with meningoencephalitis. She is improving daily since extubation. Her recent seizures are believed to be possibly due to parvovirus B19 infection, although other tests are still pending. The patient has been on acyclovir for microbial coverage, which will be discontinued today. She continues to have twitching in her right sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) but no seizure activity on EEG. Phenobarbital dosage will be titrated to 40-50 mg and continue with keppra. Ativan is being given for rigors, which have subsided with removal of stimuli and medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure may be related to parvovirus B19 infection, but further tests are still pending. The neuro service will continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation but has been successfully extubated. She is now on room air and her tachypnea is likely due to anxiety. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is essential.
3. Transaminitis: The patient had resolved transaminitis, which was likely related to parvovirus B19 infection. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is necessary.

   [**Known firstname 1125**] [**Known lastname 3689**] is 41 yo F with no significant [**Hospital 3690**] transferred from OSH
   with seizure and LP c/w meningoencephalitis. Now s/p extubation and
   improving daily. Thus far studies positive only for parvovirus b19,
   with several other labs pending.
   .
   #1 Seizures: Thought to be due to parvovirus B19, although several
   tests (including EEE, bartonella) still pending.  Since extubation she
   has not had any seizure activity on EEG although continues to have
   twitching in her R SCM at times. Per neuro service, will continue to
   dose Phenobarbital to 40-50, continue keppra. At this time she is only
   on acyclovir for microbial coverage, tomorrow being her last day of
   treatment. Ampicillin was stopped yesterday given negative CSF
   cultures. Her goal for today is to be off midazolam drip
   ID studies:
          [**Location (un) **]: CSF: neg for HSV, VZV, enterovirus, cultures
   negative. Parvovirus positive.  Blood: Final BCx negative.
          [**Hospital1 19**]: CSF: neg CMV pcr, neg HSV pcr, neg toxo, neg
   cryptoccocal Ag, adenovirus, Lyme, neg final bacterial culture.  Fungal
   and viral prelim CSF cultures are negative. CSF AFB culture is
   pending.  Blood: Negative for Histo, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, toxo, CMV,
   Lyme, EBV, ehrlichia, RPR negative. Blood Cx negative for [**12-30**], [**12-31**],
   [**1-1**].
          [**Hospital1 19**] pending: CSF: HHV-6, EEE, WNV, VZV, parvovirus,
   arbovirus, VDRL. Blood pending: bartonella PCR, EEE, LCMV, parvovirus
   IgG IgM, parvo DNA, WNV.
   - acyclovir d/c tomorrow
   - continue to wean off versed. If presistant seizures during titration
   can bolus versed and go back up by 1mg.
   - continue keppra, [**Hospital1 4170**] for level in 40s

   .
   #2 Resp failure: Doing well s/p extubation. Will continue to monitor
   her tachypnea (likely due to anxiety). She is maintaining good
   saturdation and no longer has any stridor. Currently on room air, will
   offer NC and bipap if she goes into distress. She refused to be
   reintubated yesterday after a brief period of distress post-extubation,
   which was relieved w/bipap and racemic epi.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of seizures and lumbar puncture (LP) indicating meningoencephalitis. She was previously on mechanical ventilation but is now extubated and improving daily. The patient has been diagnosed with parvovirus B19 infection, and other tests are still pending.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Seizures: The patient experienced seizures due to suspected parvovirus B19 infection. She has been receiving treatment with phenobarbital and keppra. Although she hasn't had any seizure activity on EEG, she still has twitching in her right sternocleidomastoid muscle. The neurology service plans to continue phenobarbital at a dose of 40-50 mg and keep her on keppra.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. However, she is now doing well post-extubation. Her tachypnea is likely due to anxiety, but she is maintaining good oxygen saturation without stridor. She will be monitored, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or bipap will be offered if she experiences distress.
3. Transaminitis: The patient had transient elevation of liver enzymes, which resolved. It is likely related to the parvovirus B19 infection.
4. Rashes: The patient has a perineal rash, which may affect"

   on acyclovir for microbial coverage, today being her last day of
   treatment. Ampicillin was stopped given negative CSF cultures. Titrated
   off versed.  Overnight had rigors without fever, appeared to be
   greatest in Lower ext, recorded on EEG. Gave Ativan. Subsided within 5
   mins with removal of stimuli and Ativan.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 41-year-old female, was transferred to the ICU with a diagnosis of meningoencephalitis and seizure activity. She was intubated initially but has since been extubated and is improving daily. Her seizures have subsided, but she still experiences twitching in her right sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient is being treated with acyclovir for microbial coverage, although her CSF cultures were negative for bacteria and viruses except for parvovirus B19.

The patient's other lab results are within normal limits, and she does not have any known drug allergies. Her vital signs are stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. She is maintaining good oxygen saturation without the need for supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's neurologic examination reveals mild encephalopathy, slurred speech, and intact sensation. She has not had any seizure activity on EEG since extubation. Peripheral pulses are not assessed, and skin assessment is not performed.

The patient's previous medical history is unchanged from admission, and she has no significant past medical history. Her last dose of antibiotics was on 01/18/22, and she will stop acyclovir treatment today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient initially presented with seizure activity, which may be related to parvovirus B19 infection. Although she has not had any seizure activity on EEG since extubation, she continues"
