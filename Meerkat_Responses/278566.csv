","The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who presented to the hospital with concern for seizure activity. She now presents with tachycardia, fever, and borderline blood pressure consistent with sepsis. The patient has multiple complications from serositis and infection.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. FEVER: The patient has a fever, which is consistent with sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but possible sources include abdominal infection, pericardial fluid, pleural fluid, blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient had a lumbar puncture (LP) with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 1, indicating no signs of bacterial meningitis. Other potential causes such as tamponade physiology, pulmonary embolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, or volume depletion should also be considered.

2. ANEMIA: The patient has anemia, but the cause is not specified in the progress note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple complications from serositis and infection. She presented to the medical facility with concern for seizure activity and is now showing signs of sepsis, including tachycardia, fever, and borderline blood pressure. The source of sepsis is believed to be the abdomen due to increased pelvic fluid collection with concern for abscess, as well as pericardial fluid, pleural fluid, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient had a lumbar puncture with a white blood cell count of 1, indicating no signs of bacterial meningitis. Other potential causes for the patient's condition include tamponade physiology, pulmonary embolus, gastrointestinal bleeding, and volume depletion with increased insensible losses.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient is septic with a suspected source in the abdomen. Treatment includes aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, central venous pressure monitoring, consultation with surgery and interventional radiology for drainage, and transfusion with adequate blood products. Follow-up cultures and imaging studies are planned.
2. SLE: The patient's disease activity needs to be assessed, and rheumatology consultation is recommended. Complement levels and anti-ds DNA testing will be discussed. Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is 3.2, and an MRI/MRA/MRV is needed. IV solumedrol will be continued.
3. Seizures: No further seizure activity has been observed while on Keppra. Neurology follow-up is planned, and ativan will be given as needed. EEG is being held off for now.
4. Coagulopathy: Elevated PTT and INR are present. Vitamin K supplementation and monitoring are advised.
5. Disseminated zoster: The patient's rash has improved, and acyclovir will be continued until HSV results return.
6. NAG acidosis: This is likely due to massive normal saline administration. Switching to lactated Ringer's solution and monitoring is recommended.
7. Rash: The cause of the rash is unclear, but it may be related to underlying lupus or medication. Monitoring and consideration for biopsy are advised.
8. Fluid and electrolyte management: Repletion of electrolytes and a regular diet are planned.
9. Prophylaxis: Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and venous-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis.
10. Access: The patient currently has a 22-gauge external jugular vein (EJ) line, a 20-gauge peripheral intravenous (PIV) line, and a subclavian line on the left.
11. Code status: The patient is full code.
12. Disposition: The patient's disposition is pending the above plans and interventions."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who presented to the hospital with concerns for seizure activity. She now presents with tachycardia, fever, and borderline blood pressure consistent with sepsis. The source of infection appears to be the abdomen, given the increased pelvic fluid collection with concern for abscess, pericardial fluid, pleural fluid, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. It is important to continue aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and monitor vital signs closely.

2. Abscess: The increased pelvic fluid collection raises concern for an abscess. Surgical intervention may be necessary to drain the abscess and prevent further complications.

3. Tamponade physiology: The patient's pericardial effusion needs to be monitored, as it can lead to cardiac tamponade, a condition where fluid accumulation around the heart impairs its ability to pump effectively.

4. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's history of SLE, there is an increased risk of blood clots. A pulmonary embolism should be considered, and appropriate workup should be done, including ruling out hypercoagulable states.

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple complications. She presented to the medical center with concerns of seizure activity and is now exhibiting symptoms consistent with sepsis, including tachycardia, fever, and borderline blood pressure. The potential leading source of infection is an increased pelvic fluid collection with concern for abscess, along with pericardial fluid, pleural fluid, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) with white blood cell (WBC) count of 1, indicating no signs of bacterial meningitis. Other possible causes of her symptoms include tamponade physiology, pulmonary embolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and volume depletion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of tachycardia, fever, and borderline blood pressure are consistent with sepsis. Immediate aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated to treat the infection. Surgery and interventional radiology (IR) involvement are necessary to drain the pelvic fluid collection and address any abscesses. Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring should be performed once central access is obtained.

2. Tamponade physiology: The patient has a history of SLE, which can increase the risk of pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade."

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple complications from serositis and infection. She presented to the medical facility with concern for seizure activity and was transferred to the ICU due to suspected sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The patient's current condition includes ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, pain control, rash, fever, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and other complications related to her underlying medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing symptoms suggest an ongoing infection leading to sepsis. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for any signs of deterioration.
2. Abscess: The increased pelvic fluid collection raises concern for an abscess, which could be the source of infection. The plan to involve interventional radiology (IR) to place a drain in the abdominal fluid collection should be closely monitored for resolution of the infection.
3. SLE flare-up: Given the patient's history of SLE, it is essential to assess disease activity by checking for markers such as complement levels and anti-ds DNA antibodies. Rheumatology consultation should be sought to evaluate and manage any potential SLE flare-up.
4. Coagulopathy: The elevated PTT and INR indicate a coagulopathy that requires monitoring and management. Vitamin K administration and close observation are appropriate steps to address this complication"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who presented to the ICU with concern for seizure activity and was diagnosed with sepsis. The patient has multiple complications from serositis and infection. 

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The leading source of infection is the abdomen, with an increased pelvic fluid collection suspected to be an abscess. The patient has an ineffective coping mechanism and impaired skin integrity. Pain control is also a concern due to acute and chronic pain.

2. SLE: The patient's disease activity needs to be assessed, including checking for complement levels and anti-ds DNA. The patient is currently on IV solumedrol.

3. Seizures: The patient experienced seizure activity but has been controlled while on Keppra. Neurology is following up on the case.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PTT and INR, indicating a coagulation disorder. Vitamin K is being administered for three days, and FFP was given prior to CT aspiration.

5. NAG acidosis: This condition is likely due to a massive normal saline load received on [**12-19**].

6. Rash: The patient has had a rash since discharge, which could be caused by medication or related to underlying lupus. Acyclovir has been discontinued, and consideration for a biopsy if the rash wors"
