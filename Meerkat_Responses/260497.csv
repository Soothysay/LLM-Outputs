   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Respiratory Failure: underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. currently gas exchanging well on current vent settings.
   recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by aspiration and
   inability to clear secretions.
   - blood, sputum cultures
   - empiric VAP therapy for now if no cultures + at 48 hours will
   discontinue (vanc/zosyn/cipro)
   - chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - wean FIO2 by O2sats
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level),
   hypoxia, or from underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status)
   though this was not captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in
   [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  Had
   extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing
   including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP,
   MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy.  Patient
   does not appear to be in nonconvulsive status as she does react to
   noxious stimuli and appears to calm when addressed
   - Neuro consult in AM
   - Continue dilatin at prior dosing
   - Could pursue LP although MS appears similar to that in [**Month (only) 1563**] based on
   OMR, and LP at that time was unrevealing
   # Vomiting: Unable to assess pain currently given altered mental
   status. Abdominal exam most notable for distension and firm stool
   filled colon in LLQ. KUB showing air throughout colon without evidence
   obstruction.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to represent acute ischemia given
   unchanged EKG from prior.  Trending down overnight.
   - Repeat EKG this AM
   - Complete r/o MI this morning
   - Continue aspirin
   - Once rules out can d/c plavix
   # Acute renal failure: Likely from pre-renal etiology in the setting of
   poor intake.  Patient appears dry on exam.  Chronically with foley so
   unlikely obstruction.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with a history of seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence, hypoxia, and altered mental status. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The recent exacerbation of respiratory failure is likely from vomiting complicated by aspiration and inability to clear secretions.

The patient's altered mental status is unclear, possibly due to generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated Dilantin level), hypoxia, or underlying seizure disorder. The patient does not appear to be in nonconvulsive status as they react to noxious stimuli and seem to calm when addressed.

The patient has also been experiencing vomiting, with an inability to assess pain due to altered mental status. The abdominal exam shows distension and a firm stool-filled colon in the lower left quadrant. There is no evidence of obstruction on the KUB (kidneys, ureters, and bladder) x-ray.

The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes are unlikely to represent acute ischemia given the unchanged EKG from prior. They are trending down overnight. A repeat EKG this morning will be done, and a complete ruling out of myocardial infarction (MI) will be performed. The patient will continue taking aspirin, and Plavix can be discontinued once MI is ruled out.

The patient likely has acute renal failure from pre-renal etiology in the setting of poor intake. They appear"

   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Respiratory Failure: underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Currently gas exchanging well on home vent settings.
   Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by aspiration and
   inability to clear secretions.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Empiric VAP therapy for now, if no growth, will dc antibiotics
   (vanc/zosyn) in am tomorrow.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level),
   hypoxia, or from underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status)
   though this was not captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in
   [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At
   that time, appears to have had similar mental/functional status that
   she has now; however, per notes and her son, had been making
   improvements since that time.  During her last admission, had extensive
   neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing including LP,
   paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG
   concerning for critical illness myopathy.  Patient does not appear to
   be in nonconvulsive status as she does react to noxious stimuli and
   appears to calm when addressed.
   - Neuro consult this AM
   - Continue dilatin at prior dosing
   # Vomiting: Unable to assess pain currently given altered mental
   status. Abdominal exam most notable for distension and firm stool
   filled colon in LLQ. KUB showing air throughout colon without evidence
   obstruction.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to represent acute ischemia given
   unchanged EKG from prior.  Multiple reasons for elevated troponins
   including hypoxic/PEA arrest and chest compressions per report.
   Trending down overnight.
   - Repeat EKG this AM
   - Continue aspirin
   - DC plavix given rule out as this was started just prior to admission
   at her nursing home.
   # Acute renal failure: Likely from pre-renal etiology in the setting of
   poor intake.  Patient appears dry on exam.  Chronically with foley so
   unlikely obstruction.
   - Will trend Cr
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue IVF for now.
   Continue to monitor volume status.
   - Renally dose meds
    # Anemia: Currently elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Currently normotensive although in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection.
   - Hold anti-hypertensives for now

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Respiratory Failure: underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Currently gas exchanging well on home vent settings.
   Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by aspiration and
   inability to clear secretions.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Empiric VAP therapy for now, if no growth, will dc antibiotics
   (vanc/zosyn) in am tomorrow.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level),
   hypoxia, or from underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status)
   though this was not captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in
   [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At
   that time, appears to have had similar mental/functional status that
   she has now; however, per notes and her son, had been making
   improvements since that time.  During her last admission, had extensive
   neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing including LP,
   paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG
   concerning for critical illness myopathy.  Patient does not appear to
   be in nonconvulsive status as she does react to noxious stimuli and
   appears to calm when addressed.
   - Neuro consult this AM
   - Continue dilatin at prior dosing
   # Vomiting: Unable to assess pain currently given altered mental
   status. Abdominal exam most notable for distension and firm stool
   filled colon in LLQ. KUB showing air throughout colon without evidence
   obstruction.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to represent acute ischemia given
   unchanged EKG from prior.  Multiple reasons for elevated troponins
   including hypoxic/PEA arrest and chest compressions per report.
   Trending down overnight.
   - Repeat EKG this AM
   - Continue aspirin
   - DC plavix given rule out as this was started just prior to admission
   at her nursing home.
   # Acute renal failure: Likely from pre-renal etiology in the setting of
   poor intake.  Patient appears dry on exam.  Chronically with foley so
   unlikely obstruction.
   - Will trend Cr
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue IVF for now.
   Continue to monitor volume status.
   - Renally dose meds
    # Anemia: Currently elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Currently normotensive although in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection.
   - Hold anti-hypertensives for now

   Sputum culture [**4-12**]: Pending, prelim >25 polys, < 10 epis, 1+ GPRs
   EEG [**4-12**]:
   IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and
   disorganized background admixed with bursts of moderate amplitude
   generalized delta frequency slowing. This constellation of findings is
   consistent with a moderate encephalopathy and suggests dysfunction of
   bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures. There were no areas
   of prominent focal slowing, although encephalopathic patterns can
   sometimes obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform features.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Respiratory Failure: underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Currently gas exchanging well on home vent settings.
   Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by aspiration and
   inability to clear secretions.  Per 1 son pt was tolerating hours of
   [**Name (NI) **] at NH.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures drawn, no growth on urine or blood,
   sputum with 1+ GPRs,  unlikely to be pathogen
   - will d/c VAP coverage with Vanc/Zosyn given lack of culture data,
   fevers, leukocytosis, radiographic evidence for PNA.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats, attempt mode change/PS trial today, RSBI in am
   128.
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level),
   hypoxia, or from underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status)
   though this was not captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in
   [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At
   that time, appears to have had similar mental/functional status that
   she has now; however, per notes and her son, had been making
   improvements since that time.  During her last admission, had extensive
   neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing including LP,
   paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG
   concerning for critical illness myopathy.  Patient does not appear to
   be in nonconvulsive status as she does react to noxious stimuli and
   appears to calm when addressed.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, pt may have missed a
   dose, will check a level on Monday
   - Start Keppra
   -EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   # Vomiting: Had KUB yesterday which showed stool in [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have
   been worsening residuals, vomiting and risk for aspiration. S/p
   aggressive bowel regimen with passage of large BM.
   -Continue to hold TF for now.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to represent acute ischemia given
   unchanged EKG from prior.  Multiple reasons for elevated troponins
   including hypoxic/PEA arrest and chest compressions per report.
   Trending down overnight.
   - Repeat EKG this AM no change
   - Continue aspirin
   - DC plavix given rule out as this was started just prior to admission
   at her nursing home.
   # Acute renal failure: Likely from pre-renal etiology in the setting of
   poor intake.  Patient appears dry on exam.  Chronically with foley so
   unlikely obstruction.
   - Will trend Cr, improvement since admission from 1.5 to 1.1 with
   hydration
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue IVF for now.
   Continue to monitor volume status.
   - Renally dose meds
    # Anemia: Currently elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Was hypertensive
   today to 170s systolic, was restarted on some of her home meds
   -labetalol 800TID, clonidine, will hold starting home metoprolol for
   now and monitor, consider adding back on in am.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, hypoxia, and altered mental status. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and altered mental status.

The patient's medical history includes chronic vent dependence, seizure disorder, and poor dentition. They have been on multiple medications including Piperacillin, Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levetiracetam, Lorazepam, Ondansetron, Acetaminophen, and others.

On examination, the patient has a tracheostomy in place, dry mucous membranes, and a sacral pressure ulcer. They also have increased muscle tone with cogwheeling/rigidity, right CN VII palsy, and a tongue deviated to the left.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium and magnesium.

The patient has had several cultures drawn, all of which have shown no growth. An EEG showed encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying respiratory failure of unclear etiology. They are currently gas exchanging well on home vent settings but recently experienced an exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by aspiration and inability to clear secretions.

The patient is a 76-year-old with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and altered mental status. They were transferred for hypoxia and continued to have no bowel movements (BM). The patient has been on various medications including Keppra, dilantin, and antibiotics. They are currently on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/64 to 90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's neurological examination shows increased tone with cogwheeling/rigidity, right CN VII palsy, and left corneal reflex intact. The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been obtained. The patient is on empiric VAP therapy and will have their antibiotics discontinued if no growth is observed. Chest physiotherapy and weaning of FiO2 are planned. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection, drugs, hypoxia, or underlying seizure disorder. Neuro consult is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with chronic respiratory failure now admit with concern
   for seizure onset.  She has had follow up evaluation with no evidence
   of ongoing seizure activity noted.   Neurology input for medication
   changes implemented.
   Respiratory Failure
She has persistent ventilatory failure with
   intermittent trach mask trials at facility.  Her admission at this time
   may well have been triggered by some small aspiration events and
   triggering of respiratory distress.
   -Will try PSV wean today
   -If RSBI favorable will trial brief (30 minute) trach mask trial today
   -Will need to check parameters (nif/VC/Compliance/Resistance) if
   failure seen to better define this source.
   -Will D/C abx as do not have evolution of evidence of significant
   infection and likely have aspiration pneumonitis only
   Seizure Disorder-The reported activity prior to admission is suggested
   to be seizure activity.  Here there has been minimal evidence of
   ongoing insult and EEG findings fail to show this as well which is
   reassuring.
   -Will continue Keppra per neurology team rec
   -Continue to monitor for seizure activity
   -Will continue Dilantin dosing as well.
   Hypertension
Chronic issue and medications held which will be
   re-started given hemodynamic stability.
   -Will re-start Clonidine today

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted with concerns of seizure onset. The EEG showed no active seizure activity, and neurology input for medication changes has been implemented. The patient has persistent ventilatory failure with intermittent tracheal mask trials. There is a plan to try pressure support ventilation weaning today and trial a brief tracheal mask trial if respiratory system compliance is favorable. Antibiotics will be discontinued as there is no evidence of significant infection, and it is likely that the patient has aspiration pneumonitis. The patient will continue on Keppra for seizure disorder and Dilantin dosing will also be continued. Hypertension is a chronic issue and medications will be restarted given hemodynamic stability. In the ICU, the patient will receive nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status remains full code, and the patient will remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent ventilatory failure, which can lead to further respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.
2. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient may be at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia due to intermittent tracheal mask trials and chronic respiratory failure.
3. Seizure Disorder: Although the EEG showed no active seizure activity, there is a history of reported seizure activity prior to admission. The patient may require"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Respiratory Failure: Underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by
   aspiration and inability to clear secretions.  Per son pt was
   tolerating hours of [**Name (NI) **] at NH. Currently gas exchanging well on home
   vent settings. Has been tolerating PSV/CPAP since yesterday at 1:00pm.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures drawn, no growth on urine or blood,
   sputum with 1+ GPRs,  unlikely to be pathogen
   - Will d/c VAP coverage with Vanc/Zosyn given lack of culture data,
   fevers, leukocytosis, radiographic evidence for PNA.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats, continue PS trial today ([**11-22**]), RSBI this am
   110.
   - Can attempt short trial of trach mask today if patient can tolerate.
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level),
   hypoxia, or from underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status)
   though this was not captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in
   [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At
   that time, appears to have had similar mental/functional status that
   she has now; however, per notes and her son, had been making
   improvements since that time.  During her last admission, had extensive
   neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing including LP,
   paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG
   concerning for critical illness myopathy.  Patient does not appear to
   be in nonconvulsive status as she does react to noxious stimuli and
   appears to calm when addressed.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, pt may have missed a
   dose, will check a level on Monday
   - Started Keppra
   - EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   # Vomiting: Had KUB yesterday which showed stool in [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have
   been worsening residuals, vomiting and risk for aspiration. S/p
   aggressive bowel regimen with passage of large BM.
   -Continue to hold TF for now.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to represent acute ischemia given
   unchanged EKG from prior.  Multiple reasons for elevated troponins
   including hypoxic/PEA arrest and chest compressions per report.
   Trending down overnight.
   - Repeat EKG with no change
   - Continue aspirin
   - DC'd plavix given rule out as this was started just prior to
   admission at her nursing home.
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely from pre-renal etiology in the
   setting of poor intake.  Patient initally appeared quite dry on exam.
   Chronically with foley so unlikely obstruction.
   - Trending Cr, improvement since admission from 1.5 to 1.1 with
   hydration
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue IVF for now.
   Continue to monitor volume status.
   - Renally dose meds
   # Anemia: Still elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on home
   meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, will restart home lopressor given
   persistent HTN.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Respiratory Failure: Underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by
   aspiration and inability to clear secretions.  Per son pt was
   tolerating hours of [**Name (NI) **] at NH. Currently gas exchanging well on home
   vent settings. Has been tolerating PSV/CPAP since yesterday at 1:00pm.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures drawn, no growth on urine or blood,
   sputum with 1+ GPRs,  unlikely to be pathogen
   - Will d/c VAP coverage with Vanc/Zosyn given lack of culture data,
   fevers, leukocytosis, radiographic evidence for PNA.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats, continue PS trial today ([**11-22**]), RSBI this am
   110.
   - Can attempt short trial of trach mask today if patient can tolerate.
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level),
   hypoxia, or from underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status)
   though this was not captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in
   [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At
   that time, appears to have had similar mental/functional status that
   she has now; however, per notes and her son, had been making
   improvements since that time.  During her last admission, had extensive
   neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing including LP,
   paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG
   concerning for critical illness myopathy.  Patient does not appear to
   be in nonconvulsive status as she does react to noxious stimuli and
   appears to calm when addressed.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, pt may have missed a
   dose, will check a level on Monday
   - Started Keppra
   - EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   # Vomiting: Had KUB yesterday which showed stool in [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have
   been worsening residuals, vomiting and risk for aspiration. S/p
   aggressive bowel regimen with passage of large BM.
   -Continue to hold TF for now.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to represent acute ischemia given
   unchanged EKG from prior.  Multiple reasons for elevated troponins
   including hypoxic/PEA arrest and chest compressions per report.
   Trending down overnight.
   - Repeat EKG with no change
   - Continue aspirin
   - DC'd plavix given rule out as this was started just prior to
   admission at her nursing home.
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely from pre-renal etiology in the
   setting of poor intake.  Patient initally appeared quite dry on exam.
   Chronically with foley so unlikely obstruction.
   - Trending Cr, improvement since admission from 1.5 to 1.1 with
   hydration
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue IVF for now.
   Continue to monitor volume status.
   - Renally dose meds
   # Anemia: Still elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on home
   meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, will restart home lopressor given
   persistent HTN.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old individual with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and transfer for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode and has shown improvement in gas exchange. The patient has been tolerating spontaneous breathing trials and is expected to continue with weaning of FiO2 and PS trial today. There are concerns regarding respiratory failure, altered mental status, vomiting, elevated cardiac enzymes, acute renal failure, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure may worsen if they are unable to clear secretions and maintain adequate gas exchange.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection, drugs, hypoxia, or underlying seizure disorder. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Vomiting: The patient's worsening residuals and risk for aspiration need to be closely monitored. Aggressive bowel regimen and passage of large BM have been initiated.
4. Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: Although unlikely to represent acute ischemia, the elevated troponins may be due to hypoxic/PEA arrest and chest compressions. Close monitoring is required.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, likely from a pre-renal etiology. Continued monitoring of Cr and BUN"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. They were transferred for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and seizure medications. They have also undergone multiple interventions such as tracheostomy, ventilation settings adjustment, and chest physiotherapy. The patient's condition has shown improvement in terms of gas exchange and mental status. However, they still require ongoing medical management for several issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure of unclear etiology may worsen if they are unable to clear secretions or if there is further deterioration in lung function.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown growth of oral flora in the sputum culture, indicating a possible infection. This could lead to VAP if not appropriately managed.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may continue to fluctuate due to various factors such as infection, medications, hypoxia, or underlying seizure disorder.
4. Vomiting/Regurgitation: The patient has a history of vomiting and regurgitation, which can lead to aspiration and worsening respiratory status.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Respiratory Failure: Underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by
   aspiration and inability to clear secretions.  Per son pt was
   tolerating hours of [**Name (NI) **] at NH. Currently gas exchanging well on home
   vent settings. Has been tolerating PSV/CPAP since yesterday at 1:00pm.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures drawn, no growth on urine or blood,
   sputum with 1+ GPRs/GNR,  will continue to follow micro
   - D/c
d VAP coverage with Vanc/Zosyn given lack of culture data,
   fevers, leukocytosis, radiographic evidence for PNA, growing what
   appears to be oral flora in sputum culture.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats, continue PS trial today ([**11-22**]), did not tolerate
   [**4-22**], RSBI this am 110.
   - Can attempt short trial of trach mask today if patient can tolerate.
   # Altered Mental Status: Siginificantly improved since admission.
   Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection,
   drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level), hypoxia, or from underlying
   seizure disorder (non-convulsive status) though this was not captured
   on EEG monitoring during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU
   (showed only encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to
   have had similar mental/functional status that she has now; however,
   per notes and her son, had been making improvements since that time.
   During her last admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time
   which was largely unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which
   were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical
   illness myopathy.  Patient is currently interactive and follows
   commands.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, will check a level on
   Monday
   - Started Keppra
   - EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.
   - Will restart TF this morning and increase as tolerated to goal,
   continue to check for residuals.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to represent acute ischemia given
   unchanged EKG from prior.  Multiple reasons for elevated troponins
   including hypoxic/PEA arrest and chest compressions per report.
   Trended down since admission.
   - Repeat EKG with no change
   - Continue aspirin
   - DC'd plavix given rule out as this was started just prior to
   admission at her nursing home.
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely from pre-renal etiology in the
   setting of poor intake.  Patient initally appeared quite dry on exam.
   Chronically with foley so unlikely obstruction.
   - Trending Cr, improvement since admission from 1.5 to 1.1 with
   hydration
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue IVF for now.
   Continue to monitor volume status.
   - Renally dose meds
   # Anemia: Still elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on home
   meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, will uptitrate clonidine today given
   persistent hypertension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and transfered for hypoxia and altered mental status.
- The patient has been tolerating pressure support ventilation/clearing the airway pressure (PSV/CPAP) since yesterday at 1:00 pm.
- Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been drawn, with no growth on urine or blood, and sputum showing 1+ Gram-positive rods/gram-negative rods (GNR).
- The patient's mental status has significantly improved since admission.
- The patient had an extensive neuro workup during the last admission, which was largely unrevealing.
- The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes are unlikely to represent acute ischemia given the unchanged EKG from prior.
- The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, likely from a pre-renal etiology in the setting of poor intake.
- The patient's anemia is still elevated above prior baseline, suggesting dehydration/volume contraction.
- The patient's hypertension has improved with restart of home medications.
- The patient is NPO for now due to regurgitation, and a trial of trophic feeds may be considered today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure of unclear etiology may worsen, leading to further difficulty in gas exchange and ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator
   dependence who now has admission for hypoxemia and altered mental
   status and aspiration pneumonitis. At this time with reasonable minimal
   change in overall therapy have been able to move to successful trial of
   PSV.  This may well represent an improvement in ventilator
   requirement.  This is likelly attributable to improved pneumonitis and
   patient pulmonary compliance.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   Does have baseline ventilator dependence which may be related to chest
   wall restriction and need for ventilator support.  Given improvement
   here would work towards wean of support.  What may be required is to
   have patient out of bed and upright to allow mechanical advantage to
   facilitate ventilation.
   -PSV to [**9-22**] today
change supported by good success in PSV mode of
   support at this time
   -Will continue to follow culture results in setting of antibiotics
   discontinued.
   -OOB when possible
   -RSBI-110
   -Will trial return to A/C support at night if worsening hypercarbia
   seen
   2)Seizure-
   -Continue Keppra
   -Continue Dilantin
   -Exam much improved
   -Appreciate neuro support
   2.5)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Improving with adequate fluid support and patient moving to baseline
   clearance by Creatining
   2.8)Hypertension-
   Patient with improved control with return to labetolol.  Will move to
   patient home dosing and return clonidine as next [**Doctor Last Name **] from home
   dosing.  Will tolerate modest elevations in the setting of ventilator
   weaning.
   3)ICU-Paitent with good stability and reasonable to consider transfer

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence, admitted for hypoxemia and altered mental status. She has aspiration pneumonitis and is currently on a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's baseline ventilator dependence may be related to chest wall restriction, and the goal is to wean support. She will continue to follow culture results while antibiotics are discontinued, and will be out of bed when possible. The respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 450 mL, PS of 12 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI of 155. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 171/80 to 177/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The physical examination reveals a tracheostomy in place, dullness on percussion, diminished breath sounds, and the patient is unable to stand. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 272 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Respiratory Failure: Underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by
   aspiration and inability to clear secretions.  Per son pt was
   tolerating hours of [**Name (NI) **] at NH. Currently gas exchanging well on home
   vent settings. Has been tolerating PSV/CPAP.  This AM on [**9-22**], and
   adjusted to [**4-22**].  Will attempt a trial of trach mask.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures drawn, no growth on urine or blood,
   sputum with 1+ GPRs/GNR,  will continue to follow micro
   - D/c
d VAP coverage with Vanc/Zosyn given lack of culture data,
   fevers, leukocytosis, radiographic evidence for PNA, growing what
   appears to be oral flora in sputum culture.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats, continue PS trial today, follow RISBI.
   - Can attempt short trial of trach mask today if patient can tolerate.
   # Altered Mental Status: Siginificantly improved since admission and at
   baseline.   Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from
   infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level), hypoxia, or from
   underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status) though this was not
   captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro
   ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to
   have had similar mental/functional status that she has now; however,
   per notes and her son, had been making improvements since that time.
   During her last admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time
   which was largely unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which
   were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical
   illness myopathy.  Patient is currently interactive and follows
   commands.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, -> level subtherapeutic
   this AM, d/w neuro and will give 1x loading dose today.
   - Started Keppra
   - EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist
   with BM
s and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Will restart TF this morning and increase as tolerated to goal,
   continue to check for residuals.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to represent acute ischemia given
   unchanged EKG from prior.  Multiple reasons for elevated troponins
   including hypoxic/PEA arrest and chest compressions per report.
   Trended down since admission.
   - Repeat EKG with no change
   - Continue aspirin
   - DC'd plavix given rule out as this was started just prior to
   admission at her nursing home.
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely from pre-renal etiology in the
   setting of poor intake.  Patient initally appeared quite dry on exam.
   Chronically with foley so unlikely obstruction.
   - Trending Cr, improvement since admission from 1.5 to 1.0 with
   hydration
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue tube feeds for
   now. Continue to monitor volume status.
   # Anemia: Still elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, will restart metoprolol as taking as
   outpatient. Follow.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. She was admitted for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure of unclear etiology. Recent exacerbation is likely from vomiting complicated by aspiration and inability to clear secretions. She is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV)/continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) well and has been gas exchanging well on home vent settings. It is planned to attempt a trial of tracheostomy mask.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has significantly improved since admission and at baseline. It is unclear if the altered mental status is due to generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level), hypoxia, or underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status). Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin with a loading dose today.

3. Vomiting/regurgitation: The patient had stool in the stomach on admission, which may have contributed to worsening residuals, vomiting, and aspiration. An aggressive bowel regimen has been started, including bowel movements at this time. Regurgitation also improved at this time. Reglan will be started standing to assist with bowel movements and avoid further aspiration.

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of seizure disorder and chronic
   ventilator dependence now admitted for increased hypoxemia and altered
   mental status, both of which have improved.
   Respiratory failure
   Aspiration pneumonitis appears to be the most likely cause of her acute
   decompensation; she has improved to low-grade PSV requirement, likely
   attributable to improved pneumonitis and therefore improved pulmonary
   compliance.
   Does have baseline ventilator dependence which may be related to chest
   wall restriction. While she is still here, will work toward weaning
   support
   Try TM trial today
   If unsuccessful, get further mechanics

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. She was admitted for increased hypoxemia and altered mental status, both of which have improved. The most likely cause of her acute decompensation is aspiration pneumonitis, which has improved with low-grade pressure support ventilation (PSV) requirement. The patient still depends on a ventilator, which may be related to chest wall restriction. The plan is to try a spontaneous breathing trial today and if unsuccessful, obtain further mechanics. The patient is expected to do best when out of bed and upright.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may recur if she does not successfully wean off the ventilator or if there is a recurrence of aspiration pneumonitis.
2. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and there is a need for ongoing seizure management while in the ICU.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has improving acute renal failure, and it is important to monitor renal function and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Hypertension: The patient still has substantially high blood pressure, and additional antihypertensive therapy may be required.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her prolonged ventilator dependence. Measures such as elevating the head of bed and proper hygiene practices should be implemented to prevent VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Respiratory Failure: Underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by
   aspiration and inability to clear secretions.  Per son pt was
   tolerating hours of [**Name (NI) **] at NH. Currently gas exchanging well on home
   vent settings. Has been tolerating PSV/CPAP.  This AM on [**9-22**], and
   adjusted to [**4-22**].  Will attempt a trial of trach mask.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures drawn, no growth on urine or blood,
   sputum with 1+ GPRs/GNR,  will continue to follow micro
   - D/c
d VAP coverage with Vanc/Zosyn given lack of culture data,
   fevers, leukocytosis, radiographic evidence for PNA, growing what
   appears to be oral flora in sputum culture.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats, continue PS trial today, follow RISBI.
   - Can attempt short trial of trach mask today if patient can tolerate.
   # Altered Mental Status: Siginificantly improved since admission and at
   baseline.   Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from
   infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level), hypoxia, or from
   underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status) though this was not
   captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro
   ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to
   have had similar mental/functional status that she has now; however,
   per notes and her son, had been making improvements since that time.
   During her last admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time
   which was largely unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which
   were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical
   illness myopathy.  Patient is currently interactive and follows
   commands.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, -> level subtherapeutic
   this AM, d/w neuro and will give 1x loading dose today.
   - Started Keppra
   - EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist
   with BM
s and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Will restart TF this morning and increase as tolerated to goal,
   continue to check for residuals.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to represent acute ischemia given
   unchanged EKG from prior.  Multiple reasons for elevated troponins
   including hypoxic/PEA arrest and chest compressions per report.
   Trended down since admission.
   - Repeat EKG with no change
   - Continue aspirin
   - DC'd plavix given rule out as this was started just prior to
   admission at her nursing home.
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely from pre-renal etiology in the
   setting of poor intake.  Patient initally appeared quite dry on exam.
   Chronically with foley so unlikely obstruction.
   - Trending Cr, improvement since admission from 1.5 to 1.0 with
   hydration
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue tube feeds for
   now. Continue to monitor volume status.
   # Anemia: Still elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, will restart metoprolol as taking as
   outpatient. Follow.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Respiratory Failure: Underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by
   aspiration and inability to clear secretions.  Per son pt was
   tolerating hours of [**Name (NI) **] at NH. Currently gas exchanging well on home
   vent settings. Has been tolerating PSV/CPAP.  This AM on [**9-22**], and
   adjusted to [**4-22**].
   - trial of trach mask.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures drawn, no growth on urine or blood,
   sputum with 1+ GPRs/GNR,  will continue to follow micro
   - repeat sputum given increased sputum production
   - D/c
d VAP coverage with Vanc/Zosyn given lack of culture data,
   fevers, leukocytosis, radiographic evidence for PNA, growing what
   appears to be oral flora in sputum culture.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats, continue PS trial today, follow RISBI.
   # Altered Mental Status: Siginificantly improved since admission and at
   baseline.   Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from
   infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level), hypoxia, or from
   underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status) though this was not
   captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro
   ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to
   have had similar mental/functional status that she has now; however,
   per notes and her son, had been making improvements since that time.
   During her last admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time
   which was largely unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which
   were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical
   illness myopathy.  Patient is currently interactive and follows
   commands.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, -> level subtherapeutic
   this AM, d/w neuro and will give 1x loading dose today.
   - Started Keppra
   - daily dilantin level
   - EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist
   with BM
s and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - cont TF, check residuals
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely from pre-renal etiology in the
   setting of poor intake.  Patient initally appeared quite dry on exam.
   Chronically with foley so unlikely obstruction.
   - Trending Cr, improvement since admission from 1.5 to 1.0 with
   hydration
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue tube feeds for
   now. Continue to monitor volume status.
   # Anemia: Still elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable, with high blood pressure and tachycardia. He required immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of asthma and is allergic to shellfish. His last dose of antibiotics was administered on [**2115-4-16**] at 03:15 PM. The patient is receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is also on other ICU medications, including Heparin Sodium, Nutrition (Nutren Pulmonary), and Glycemic Control.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of mild abdominal pain.

Physical Examination:
The patient's peripheral vascular examination reveals weak and thready pulses bilaterally. His skin is pale and diaphoretic. Neurologic examination shows decreased verbal response to commands and decreased movement. The patient's tone is normal.

Lab Results:
The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.5, anemia with a Hct level of 30.1, and thrombocytosis with a Plt count of 272. Other notable lab values include elevated Troponin-T levels at 0.39, TCO2 at 28, and Glucose at 101. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis against DVT, indicating an increased risk for blood clots. If a clot were to form and dislodge, it could lead to a potentially life-threatening PE.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and the use of corticosteroids for asthma management increase the risk of stress ulcer development.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state due to mechanical ventilation and medications increases the risk of nosocomial infections.
5. Barotrauma: The patient's high plateau pressure and PIP values indicate the possibility of barotrauma, which is lung injury caused by excessive airway pressures during mechanical ventilation.

Please note that this is a summary of the provided information, and further assessment and evaluation by a healthcare professional are necessary for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."

   76-year-old woman with history of seizure disorder and chronic
   ventilator dependence now admitted for increased hypoxemia and altered
   mental status, both of which have improved. Notably, on day PTA,
   suffered PEA arrest in setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging.
   Respiratory failure
          Etiology of chronic resp failure unclear- NM vs. chest wall
   restriction.
          Aspiration pneumonitis appears to be the most likely cause
   of her acute decompensation; she has improved to low-grade PSV
   requirement, likely attributable to improved pneumonitis and therefore
   improved pulmonary compliance.
          Repeat sputum cx today given thick yellow sputum (no empiric
   abx for now given afebrile, WBC nl).
          TC trial today.
   Altered mental status

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. She was admitted for increased hypoxemia and altered mental status. The patient suffered from a PEA arrest due to hypoxemia/mucous plugging but has since improved.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure with unclear etiology (NM vs. chest wall restriction). Aspiration pneumonitis appears to be the most likely cause of her acute decompensation. Complications such as pneumonia or further episodes of respiratory failure could occur if the underlying cause is not properly managed.

2. Altered mental status: The patient experienced altered mental status post-PEA arrest. Possible causes include post-cardiac arrest syndrome or other factors such as infection or medication side effects. Monitoring for any further decline in mental status and addressing potential underlying causes is crucial.

3. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and it is important to continue current anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) with neurology's help. Any signs of seizure recurrence should be promptly managed.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure but is improving. Monitoring kidney function and addressing any contributing factors is essential to prevent further deterioration.

5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be managed appropriately to prevent complications such as"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, on mechanical ventilation, and recent neurological decline admitted following aspiration pneumonia and possible seizure with hypoxemia and altered mental status. The patient suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to hypoxemia/mucous plugging on day PTA.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/82 mmHg to 120/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 111, plateau pressure (Plateau) of 22 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds bilaterally, symmetric chest expansion, and soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Neurological examination shows attentiveness, ability to follow simple commands, and response to stimuli but movement, tone, and deep tendon reflexes are not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 272 K/uL, blood glucose of 101 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.39 ng/mL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 28 mg/dL. Other lab values including electrolytes and cardiac enzymes are within normal range.

Microbiology results show rare gram-negative rods (>25 pmn, <10 epi) in the sputum sample collected on day 4-12.

Assessment and plan:
1. Altered mental status - possibly post-PEA arrest. Head CT is normal, EEG shows no evidence of seizure, and no obvious infection is present. The neuro team believes the mental status is at baseline.
2. sz d/o - continue current anti-epileptic medications.
3. Weakness - possibly critical illness myopathy. Sural/gastrocnemius nerve biopsy is planned for 4/19.
4. Resp failure - chronic respiratory failure unclear, possibly neurogenic or chest wall restriction. Acute decompensation likely due to aspiration pneumonitis, which has improved and the patient is now tolerating low-level PSV. Will repeat sputum culture given thick yellow sputum (no empiric antibiotics for now due to afebrile, WBC normal). Repeat TC trial today.
5. HTN - continue current regimen, blood pressure improved.

ICU care includes nutrition through enteral feeding, glycemic control, DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with head-of-bed elevation and mouth care.

The patient's disposition is transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   #AFB: Patient with a positive AFB reported from lab on basis of
   suspicious gram stain lab took initiative to perform AFB
s.  Now on
   respiratory isolation.  Obtaining repeat AFB smears.  No known history
   of TB.  Would also consider [**Doctor First Name **] or nocardia.
   -          continue respiratory isolation, and await sensitivity and
   speciation on AFB.
   -          Chest X-ray, sputum, AFB as above.
   -          Will need PCR and will need to notifiy LTAC facility if
   positive result.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: New today.  Will work-up with CXR, Ua, Blood culture,
   sputum given slightly more lethargic appearance on exam.
   -          Concern for pneumonia in this patient with aspiration risk
   -          Defer treatment until source identified unless patient
   decompensates.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by
   aspiration and inability to clear secretions.  Per son pt was
   tolerating hours of [**Name (NI) **] at NH. Currently gas exchanging well on home
   vent settings. Has been tolerating PSV/CPAP.  This AM on [**9-22**], and
   adjusted to [**4-22**].
   - trial of trach mask [**4-16**]
 patient could not tolerate.  Otherwise at
   baseline on home CPAP settings.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures drawn, no growth on urine or blood,
   sputum with 1+ GPRs/GNR,  will continue to follow micro
   - repeat sputum given increased sputum production
   - D/c
d VAP coverage with Vanc/Zosyn given lack of culture data,
   fevers, leukocytosis, radiographic evidence for PNA, growing what
   appears to be oral flora in sputum culture.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats, continue PS today,
   # Altered Mental Status: Siginificantly improved since admission and at
   baseline although mildly more lethargic today.   Unclear if generalized
   toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated
   dilantin level), hypoxia, or from underlying seizure disorder
   (non-convulsive status) though this was not captured on EEG monitoring
   during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU (showed only
   encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to have had similar
   mental/functional status that she has now; however, per notes and her
   son, had been making improvements since that time.  During her last
   admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely
   unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative,
   SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness
   myopathy.  Patient is currently interactive and follows commands.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, -> level subtherapeutic
   this AM, d/w neuro and will give 1x loading dose today and increase to
   150 TID.
   - Started Keppra
   - daily dilantin level
   - EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist
   with BM
s and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - held TF for increased residuals -> restart today as tolerated.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely from pre-renal etiology in the
   setting of poor intake.  Patient initally appeared quite dry on exam.
   Chronically with foley so unlikely obstruction.
   - Trending Cr, improvement since admission from 1.5 to 1.0 with
   hydration
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue tube feeds for
   now. Continue to monitor volume status.
   # Anemia: Still elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, hydralazine, lopressor

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient has been stabilized and is awaiting a nerve biopsy before discharge.

Recent events include receiving a 500cc normal saline bolus for decreased urine output, undergoing a sural nerve biopsy on Friday, and having no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) at 37 degrees Celsius, current temperature at 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) between 81-90 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 134/73 to 120/59 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) between 26-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 97%.

The patient's neurological status has improved since admission but is still somewhat lethargic. He is attentive and follows simple commands. The patient's respiratory status has also improved and he is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV)/continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.6 K/uL, elevated hematocrit (Hct) of 30.3%, and platelet count (Plt) of 272. Other lab values, including kidney function tests (Cr"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. She was admitted for increased hypoxemia and altered mental status. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging.

The patient has shown improvement in hypoxemia and altered mental status. She has been placed in negative pressure isolation due to the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in her sputum culture. Repeat sputum samples have been sent for further testing.

The patient remains mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The etiology of her chronic respiratory failure is unclear, with possibilities including neuromuscular weakness or chest wall restriction. Aspiration pneumonitis appears to be the most likely cause of her acute decompensation, as she has improved with low-grade pressure support ventilation (PSV) requirement, likely due to improved pneumonitis and pulmonary compliance.

The patient's altered mental status is uncertain, possibly post-PEA arrest. A head CT scan was normal, EEG showed no evidence of seizures, and no obvious infection was found. The neurology team believes her mental status is at her baseline.

The patient's seizure disorder is being managed with current anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).

Acute renal failure is improving, hypertension is being treated, and the patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. She was admitted for increased hypoxemia and altered mental status, both of which have improved. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging. Sputum culture with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) revealed the presence of AFB, indicating a possible Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has shown improvement in respiratory failure due to improved pneumonitis and increased pulmonary compliance. Her altered mental status is being evaluated, with a head CT showing no abnormalities and an electroencephalogram (EEG) without any evidence of seizure activity. The neuro team believes her mental status is at her baseline. She also has acute renal failure, hypertension, and a seizure disorder. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of post-polio syndrome, wound care concerns, fluid retention, and infection. The patient is currently on cefepime for GNR growing in sputum and lasix for grossly positive fluid status. He has a scheduled neurosurgery consultation for a biopsy and PCR results on sputum specimen pending. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 100/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,505 mL and output of 955 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,550 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation support with FiO2 at 50%. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.6 K/uL, elevated CRP, elevated Troponin-T, and other abnormal lab values. Imaging reveals large bilateral pleural effusions, worsening perihilar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, and a tracheostomy tube in place. Microbiology cultures are pending. The patient's condition is critical, and further evaluation and treatment are required. 

Potential Medical Complications:

   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   #AFB: Moderate AFB on concentrated smear.  Await speciation and
   consideration of treatment.  Avoid flouroquinolones given possible TB.
   Will need to continue isolation.
   -          continue respiratory isolation, and await sensitivity and
   speciation on AFB.
   -          Chest X-ray, sputum, AFB as above.
   -          Will need PCR and will need to notifiy LTAC facility if
   positive result.
   .
   #Pneumonia/Leukocytosis: 4+GNR
s in sputum.  Started cefepime yesterday
   for pneumonia.  Negative blood urine cultures to date.
   -          Concern for pneumonia in this patient with aspiration risk
   -          Defer treatment until source identified unless patient
   decompensates.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by
   aspiration and inability to clear secretions.  Per son pt was
   tolerating hours of [**Name (NI) **] at NH. Currently gas exchanging well on home
   vent settings. Has been tolerating PSV/CPAP.  This AM on [**9-22**], and
   adjusted to [**4-22**].
   - trial of trach mask [**4-16**]
 patient could not tolerate.  Otherwise at
   baseline on home CPAP settings.  Some increase in pressure support to
   14 today, likely [**1-19**] to pneumonia with component of volume overload as
   noted on CXR.
   - follow micro
   - repeat sputum given increased sputum production
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats, continue PS today,
   # Altered Mental Status: Siginificantly improved since admission and at
   baseline although mildly more lethargic today.   Unclear if generalized
   toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated
   dilantin level), hypoxia, or from underlying seizure disorder
   (non-convulsive status) though this was not captured on EEG monitoring
   during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU (showed only
   encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to have had similar
   mental/functional status that she has now; however, per notes and her
   son, had been making improvements since that time.  During her last
   admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely
   unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative,
   SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness
   myopathy.  Patient is currently interactive and follows commands.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, Phenytoin level mildly
   subtherapeutic.  D/W neurology regarding increased dose
   - Continue Keppra
   - EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy.
   .
   #Volume Status: 4.5L input yesterday with minimal output.  Clarify
   underlying fluid intake.  In interim will diurese today with 40mg IV
   lasix x1 and follow UOP during the day.
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist
   with BM
s and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - held TF for increased residuals -> restart today as tolerated.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely from pre-renal etiology in the
   setting of poor intake.  Patient initally appeared quite dry on exam.
   Chronically with foley so unlikely obstruction.
   - Trending Cr, improvement since admission from 1.5 to 1.0 with
   hydration
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue tube feeds for
   now. Continue to monitor volume status.
   # Anemia: Prior baseline is 25, now at 30-34.  Suggests volume
   contraction but other components of exam suggest volume overload.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, hydralazine, lopressor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old individual with a history of seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence, and recent transfer for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis: The patient's sputum culture showed the presence of GNR bacteria. Cefepime was started for pneumonia treatment, but blood and urine cultures have been negative so far.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration from vomiting and inability to clear secretions. The patient is currently on home CPAP settings with increased pressure support to 14 cmH2O.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has significantly improved since admission but remains lethargic. The cause of the altered mental status is unclear, possibly due to infection, hypoxia, drugs, or underlying seizure disorder.
4. Volume Status: The patient has an input-output imbalance, indicating potential fluid overload. Lasix has been given to promote diuresis.
5. Vomiting/Regurgitation: The patient has been experiencing regurgitation and vomiting, leading to worsening residuals and aspiration. Aggressive bowel regimen and medications like Reglan have been initiated to manage these symptoms.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal etiology."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   #AFB: Patient with a positive AFB reported from lab on basis of
   suspicious gram stain lab took initiative to perform AFB
s.  Now on
   respiratory isolation.  Obtaining repeat AFB smears.  No known history
   of TB.  Would also consider [**Doctor First Name **] or nocardia.
   -          continue respiratory isolation, and await sensitivity and
   speciation on AFB.
   -          Chest X-ray, sputum, AFB as above.
   -          Will need PCR and will need to notifiy LTAC facility if
   positive result.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: New today.  Will work-up with CXR, Ua, Blood culture,
   sputum given slightly more lethargic appearance on exam.
   -          Concern for pneumonia in this patient with aspiration risk
   -          Defer treatment until source identified unless patient
   decompensates.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Recent exacerbation likely from vomiting complicated by
   aspiration and inability to clear secretions.  Per son pt was
   tolerating hours of [**Name (NI) **] at NH. Currently gas exchanging well on home
   vent settings. Has been tolerating PSV/CPAP.  This AM on [**9-22**], and
   adjusted to [**4-22**].
   - trial of trach mask [**4-16**]
 patient could not tolerate.  Otherwise at
   baseline on home CPAP settings.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures drawn, no growth on urine or blood,
   sputum with 1+ GPRs/GNR,  will continue to follow micro
   - repeat sputum given increased sputum production
   - D/c
d VAP coverage with Vanc/Zosyn given lack of culture data,
   fevers, leukocytosis, radiographic evidence for PNA, growing what
   appears to be oral flora in sputum culture.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Wean FIO2 by O2sats, continue PS today,
   # Altered Mental Status: Siginificantly improved since admission and at
   baseline although mildly more lethargic today.   Unclear if generalized
   toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated
   dilantin level), hypoxia, or from underlying seizure disorder
   (non-convulsive status) though this was not captured on EEG monitoring
   during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU (showed only
   encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to have had similar
   mental/functional status that she has now; however, per notes and her
   son, had been making improvements since that time.  During her last
   admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely
   unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative,
   SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness
   myopathy.  Patient is currently interactive and follows commands.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, -> level subtherapeutic
   this AM, d/w neuro and will give 1x loading dose today and increase to
   150 TID.
   - Started Keppra
   - daily dilantin level
   - EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist
   with BM
s and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - held TF for increased residuals -> restart today as tolerated.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely from pre-renal etiology in the
   setting of poor intake.  Patient initally appeared quite dry on exam.
   Chronically with foley so unlikely obstruction.
   - Trending Cr, improvement since admission from 1.5 to 1.0 with
   hydration
   - IVF with some improvement in BUN/Cr, will continue tube feeds for
   now. Continue to monitor volume status.
   # Anemia: Still elevated above prior baseline of 25 suggesting
   dehydration/volume contraction.
   - Trend Hct
   - IVF prn as above.
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, hydralazine, lopressor

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and recent transfer for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications and conditions. 

1. Positive Acid Fast Culture: The patient has tested positive for acid-fast bacilli, indicating a possible tuberculosis (TB) infection. The lab took the initiative to perform an Acid Fast Stain and sent the sample for further testing. The patient is currently on respiratory isolation and awaiting sensitivity and speciation results.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has shown an increase in white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection. The healthcare team will work up a chest X-ray, urine analysis, blood culture, and sputum culture to identify the source of the infection.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure has worsened, likely due to vomiting and aspiration. The patient is currently tolerating CPAP settings but has had difficulty with tracheostomy mask tolerance. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been drawn, revealing the presence of gram-negative rods in the sputum culture. The healthcare team will continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide appropriate interventions.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved since admission but remains mildly lethargic. The cause of the altered mental status is unclear, with potential factors including generalized toxic metabolic encephal"

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of seizure disorder and chronic
   ventilator dependence now admitted for increased hypoxemia and altered
   mental status, both of which have improved. Notably, on day PTA,
   suffered PEA arrest in setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging.
   AFB: sputum cx sent to lab and noted to have AFB visible. Infection
   control notified, put in neg pressure room. Repeat +, sample to state
   lab for PCR now for MTb.
   4+ GNR in sputum : with increased secretions
 added cefipime last  PM,
   awaiting data
   Respiratory failure: remains of mech ventilation failed TC yesterday
   due to hypertension and visble distress. Also ++ secretions so placed
   back on CMV
          Etiology of chronic resp failure unclear- NM vs. chest wall
   restriction. Appreciate Neuro input. Plan for sural nerve Bx to   help
   differentiate post poli, crit care myopathy, or other etiologies
   .          PSV requirement, likely attributable to improved pneumonitis
   and therefore improved pulmonary compliance.
          Repeat sputum cx today given thick yellow sputum -
   Altered mental status: ?post PEA arrest.  Head CT wnl, EEG w/o e/o sz,
   and no obvious infection. Currently, the neuro team, who knows her well
   thinks her mental status is at her baseline.
   Seizure disorder: Appreciate neurology
s help; we will continue current
   AEDs.
   Acute Renal Failure: Improving, will add lasix to keep closer to even
   Hypertension: Continue present regimen (she has a high baseline
   requirement but has improved over past day)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. She was admitted for increased hypoxemia and altered mental status, both of which have improved. The patient suffered a PEA arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging on day PTA. She has been diagnosed with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in her sputum and has been placed in a negative pressure room. The patient's respiratory failure persists, and she remains on mechanical ventilation due to hypertension and visible distress. She also has increased secretions and is back on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). 

The etiology of the patient's chronic respiratory failure is unclear, with possible causes including neuromuscular weakness (NM) or chest wall restriction. A sural nerve biopsy has been planned to help differentiate between post-polio, critical care myopathy, or other etiologies. The patient's PSV (pressure support ventilation) requirement has decreased, likely due to improved pneumonitis and increased pulmonary compliance. 

The patient's altered mental status may be post-PEA arrest, but her head CT is normal, EEG shows no evidence of seizures, and no obvious infection is present. The neuro team believes that her mental status is at her baseline. The patient's seizure disorder requires further evaluation by neurology, and she will continue on her current anti-ep"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 66-inch tall, 63.8 kg individual admitted with respiratory failure. They are currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilator support with a set Vt of 0 mL, PS of 14 cmH2O, RR set at 0, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and RSBI of 110. The patient's blood pressure ranges from 134/77 to 153/80 mmHg, heart rate is between 72-83 bpm, respiratory rate is 16-28 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation is consistently at 100%. 

The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or tone examinations. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 8.2 to 16.6 thousand/mm3, hematocrit (Hct) ranging from 26.8 to 34.0%, and platelet count (Plt) ranging from 210 to 272 thousand/mm3. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there is an increase in troponin-T levels. Other lab values such as creatinine (Cr), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. She was admitted for increased hypoxemia and altered mental status, both of which have improved. She suffered a PEA arrest due to hypoxemia/mucous plugging. The patient has an active infection with positive AFB in her sputum, indicating a possible tuberculosis infection. She also has increased GNR in her sputum and is being treated with cefipime. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is likely caused by either neuromuscular weakness or chest wall restriction. The etiology of her chronic respiratory failure is unclear. An altered mental status persists, possibly post-PEA arrest, and further evaluation by the neurology team is needed. The patient's seizure disorder requires ongoing management. She has acute renal failure that is improving, and her hypertension is being managed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there are complications from mechanical ventilation or if her underlying neuromuscular weakness or chest wall restriction worsens.
2. Tuberculosis Infection: The positive AFB in the sputum indicates an active tuberculosis infection. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this could lead to disease progression and complications.
3. Sepsis: The presence of increased GNR in the sputum suggests a bacterial infection. If the infection spreads to the"

   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Pseudomonal pneumonia: Moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum
   cuilture from [**4-16**], sensitive to cefepime.  Blood cultures with NGTD,
   and urine cultures negative.   Moderate AFB on concentrated smear, non
   TB.  We discontinued respiratory isolation.
   -continue cefepime for a seven day course
   # Respiratory Failure: Underlying respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology given prior evaluation was only revealing for critical illness
   neuropathy. Possibly related to pneumonia.  Currently on CPAP at 14/5,
   which is increased from her baseline given her PNA and volume overload.
   -Continue to wean pressure support as tolerated to home settings.
   - Chest PT, aggressive pulmonary toilet
   # Altered Mental Status: Siginificantly improved since admission and at
   baseline although mildly more lethargic today.   Unclear if generalized
   toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated
   dilantin level), hypoxia, or from underlying seizure disorder
   (non-convulsive status) though this was not captured on EEG monitoring
   during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro ICU (showed only
   encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to have had similar
   mental/functional status that she has now; however, per notes and her
   son, had been making improvements since that time.  During her last
   admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely
   unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative,
   SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy.
   - Neuro consult recommends continuing dilantin, Phenytoin level mildly
   subtherapeutic.  D/W neurology regarding increased dose
   - Continue Keppra
   - EEG shows encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy.
   #Volume Status: Even over the last 24 hours with lasix
   -continue lasix bolus of 40mg IV to keep I/O even
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist
   with BM
s and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be 27-28.  stable
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and transfer for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications including pseudomonal pneumonia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, myopathy, volume status, vomiting/regurgitation, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum culture, which is sensitive to cefepime. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent the spread of the infection and further complications.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure of unclear etiology needs to be managed carefully. She is currently on CPAP at 14/5, which has been increased from her baseline due to pneumonia and volume overload. Weaning off pressure support as tolerated and implementing aggressive pulmonary toilet is necessary to improve her respiratory function.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's significantly improved mental status since admission indicates a positive response to treatment. However, her lethargy today may suggest a mild worsening. It is important to continue monitoring her mental status and addressing any potential underlying causes such as generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection, drugs, hypoxia, or underlying seizure disorder.

4. Myopathy: The patient has been diagnosed with critical illness myopathy, likely related to her prolonged mechanical ventilation. A sural nerve biopsy has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. She was admitted for increased hypoxemia and altered mental status. The patient suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging. She has been diagnosed with pseudomonas pneumonia and is currently being treated with cefipime. Her white blood cell count has improved, but she still has secretions. The respiratory failure etiology is unclear, whether it is due to neuromuscular disease or chest wall restriction. A plan for a sural nerve biopsy has been made to differentiate between post-polio syndrome, critical care myopathy, or other etiologies. The patient's positive sputum culture for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) indicates possible tuberculosis (TB), and a PCR test has been sent to rule out Mycobacterium tuberculosis. No empirical treatment for TB has been started yet. The patient's altered mental status may be due to post-PEA arrest, but a head CT was normal, EEG showed no seizure activity, and no obvious infection was found. The neurology team believes her mental status is at her baseline. The patient's acute renal failure is improving, and she will be given lasix to keep her fluid balance closer to even. Hypertension will be managed with the current regimen. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and she will remain in the ICU."

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/53 to 143/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 323 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 8.2 to 16.6 thousand/mm3, hematocrit ranging from 26.8% to 34.0%, platelet count ranging from 210 to 272 thousand/mm3, blood glucose levels between 70 and 143 mg/dL, and creatinine levels ranging from 0.8 to 1.3 mg/d"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Pseudomonal pneumonia: Moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum
   cuilture from [**4-16**], sensitive to cefepime.  Blood cultures with NGTD,
   and urine cultures negative.   Moderate AFB on concentrated smear, non
   TB.  We discontinued respiratory isolation.
   -continue cefepime for a seven day course
   - continue with AC for now given tenuos hemodynamic status,  RSBI 138

    # Altered Mental Status: Siginificantly improved since admission and
   at baseline although mildly more lethargic last 3 days, found to be in
   status epilepticus, ddx anoxi brain injury s/p cardiac arrest ,
   infection.   Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from
   infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level), hypoxia, or from
   underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status) though this was not
   captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro
   ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to
   have had similar mental/functional status that she has now; however,
   per notes and her son, had been making improvements since that time.
   During her last admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time
   which was largely unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which
   were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical
   illness myopathy.
   - subclinical status epilepticus- keppra, phenytoin, follow daily
   phenytoin levels
   - neuro recs
   - Continue Keppra
   - EEG shows

   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, transferred for hypoxia, and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, for which she is receiving cefepime. Her altered mental status has improved since admission but remains mildly lethargic. The patient also has anemia, hypertension (mostly during breathing trials), and vomiting/regurgitation issues. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has pseudomonal pneumonia, which requires treatment with antibiotics. There is also a mention of potential infection contributing to her altered mental status.
2. Status Epilepticus: The patient was found to be in status epilepticus, and she is at risk of recurrent episodes.
3. Anoxia Brain Injury: The patient had a cardiac arrest in the past, which could have led to anoxia brain injury contributing to her altered mental status.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension requiring fluid boluses and a switch from CPAP to AC.
5. Aspiration: The patient has regurgitation and vomiting issues, which can lead to aspiration, especially during breathing trials.
6. Chronic Ventilator Dependence: The patient has a history of chronic ventilator dependence, indicating a potential long-term respiratory issue.
7. Sural Nerve Biopsy: The patient is planned for a sural nerve biopsy once stable, suggesting a possible underlying neurop"

   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Pseudomonal pneumonia: Moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum
   cuilture from [**4-16**], sensitive to cefepime.  Blood cultures with NGTD,
   and urine cultures negative.   Moderate AFB on concentrated smear, non
   TB.  We discontinued respiratory isolation.
   - continue cefepime for a seven day course
   - continue with AC for now given tenuous hemodynamic status,  RSBI 138
   this am
   .
    # Altered Mental Status: more lethargic last 3 days, found to be in
   status epilepticus, ddx anoxi brain injury s/p cardiac arrest ,
   infection.   Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from
   infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level), hypoxia, or from
   underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status) though this was not
   captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro
   ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to
   have had similar mental/functional status that she has now; however,
   per notes and her son, had been making improvements since that time.
   During her last admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time
   which was largely unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which
   were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical
   illness myopathy.
   - subclinical status epilepticus- keppra, phenytoin, follow daily
   phenytoin levels
   - Neuro recs, MRI brain to be coordinated with neuro, currently on 24
   hour EEG monitoring
   - Continue Keppra
   - continuous EEG monitoring
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable
   #Volume Status: 600 cc urine last 24 hours in setting hypotension
   - bolus for UOP<30cc/hr
   - hold BP meds
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist
   with BM
s and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs

   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be 27-28.  stable
   .
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - hold BP meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has been experiencing subclinical status epilepticus, which was confirmed through EEG monitoring. She was given lorazepam and dilantin as per neurologist recommendations. Due to the use of ativan, her MAPs and respiratory rate dropped, requiring fluid boluses and a switch from CPAP to AC. Brain MRI was held off until she stabilized. A family meeting was held, and they decided to postpone the sural nerve biopsy due to her acute decompensation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum culture, indicating a possible infection. It is essential to continue cefepime for a seven-day course to treat this infection.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been deteriorating over the last three days, and she was found to be in non-convulsive status epilepticus. The cause could be anoxic brain injury post-cardiac arrest, infection, or underlying seizure disorder. Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Volume Status: The patient has a low urine output of 600 cc in the last 24 hours while experiencing hypotension. This indicates a potential volume depletion. It is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of post-polio syndrome, chronic respiratory failure, and being ventilator-dependent. She was admitted with hypoxemia, altered mental status, and weakness, suspected to have critical illness neuropathy and possible pneumonia (PNA). Over the last two days, her mental status has worsened, and she experienced subclinical status epilepticus. The patient requires continuous EEG monitoring, and she is unresponsive. Her respiratory failure is due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and critical illness neuropathy. She is currently on cefepime for PNA and requires IV fluids for hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to being ventilator-dependent and having a weakened immune system.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given her prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Critical Illness Myopathy/Neuropathy: The patient's weakness and altered mental status may be indicative of critical illness myopathy or neuropathy, which can be caused by prolonged immobilization, sedation, and the use of certain medications.
4. Status Epilepticus: The patient's recent episode of subclinical status epilepticus indicates a potential for recurrent seizures or further neurological complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of post-polio syndrome, chronic respiratory failure, and being ventilator-dependent. She was admitted with hypoxemia, altered mental status, and weakness. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing worsening mental status.

Key findings and events include:
- EEG results showing subclinical status epilepticus.
- The patient received dilantin and ativan, resulting in hypotension and responded to 3L IVF repletion.
- She has been on cefepime for suspected pneumonia.
- The patient has an altered level of consciousness and is unresponsive.
- Vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, and normal heart rate.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST.
- Blood gases indicate a slightly alkalotic pH, normal PaCO2, elevated PaO2, and normal oxygen saturation.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, normal creatinine, and slightly elevated glucose levels.
- Imaging reveals large bilateral effusions.

The patient's medical complications and potential issues include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and critical illness neuropathy. She requires continued respiratory support.
2. Status Epilepticus: The patient's EEG monitoring showed subclinical status epileptic"

   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Pseudomonal pneumonia: Moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum
   cuilture from [**4-16**], sensitive to cefepime.  Blood cultures with NGTD,
   and urine cultures negative.   Moderate AFB on concentrated smear, non
   TB.  Have discontinued respiratory isolation.
   - continue cefepime for a seven day course through [**2115-4-24**] (adjust
   dose for renal function)
   - continue with AC for now given tenuous hemodynamic status,  RSBI 138
   this am
   - Check ABG this AM given Bicarbonate of 18.
   .
    # Altered Mental Status: more lethargic last 3 days, found to be in
   status epilepticus, ddx anoxi brain injury s/p cardiac arrest ,
   infection.   Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from
   infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level), hypoxia, or from
   underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status) though this was not
   captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro
   ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to
   have had similar mental/functional status that she has now; however,
   per notes and her son, had been making improvements since that time.
   During her last admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time
   which was largely unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which
   were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical
   illness myopathy.
   - subclinical status epilepticus- keppra, phenytoin, follow daily
   phenytoin levels
   - Neuro recs, MRI brain to be coordinated with neuro, currently on 24
   hour EEG monitoring
   - Continue Keppra
   - continuous EEG monitoring
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable - family not willing to
   consent as patient in satus
   .
    #Volume Status: 348 cc UOP yesterday.  Will bolus fluids today for
   increased urine output.
   - bolus for UOP<30cc/hr
   - hold BP meds
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist
   with BM
s and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   .
    # Anemia: Baseline appears to be 27-28.  stable
   .
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - hold BP meds
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, hydralazine, lopressor all being HELD
   given hypotension with dilantin/propofol.  Would restart labetalol
   first w/ hydralazine next for afterload reduction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has been experiencing episodes of status epilepticus, and her mental status has been deteriorating over the last three days. She has moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum culture, which is sensitive to cefepime. Blood cultures with NGTD and urine cultures are negative. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an RSBI of 138. She has large bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral atelectases on chest X-ray. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a low platelet count. She has moderate AFB on concentrated smear, which is non-TB. The patient's medications include cefepime, propofol, phenytoin, and levetiracetam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum culture, which is sensitive to cefepime. She should continue to receive cefepime for a seven-day course through [**2115-4-24**]. Monitoring for signs of improvement or worsening"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Pseudomonal pneumonia: Moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum
   cuilture from [**4-16**], sensitive to cefepime.  Blood cultures with NGTD,
   and urine cultures negative.   Moderate AFB on concentrated smear, non
   TB.  Have discontinued respiratory isolation.
   - continue cefepime for a seven day course through [**2115-4-23**] (adjust
   dose for renal function)
   - continue with AC for now given propofol and status, wean as tolerated
   - Check ABG this AM given Bicarbonate of 18.
   .
    # Altered Mental Status: more lethargic last 3 days, found to be in
   status epilepticus, ddx anoxi brain injury s/p cardiac arrest ,
   infection.   Unclear if generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from
   infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level), hypoxia, or from
   underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status) though this was not
   captured on EEG monitoring during last admission in [**Month (only) 1563**] to the Neuro
   ICU (showed only encephalopathic background).  At that time, appears to
   have had similar mental/functional status that she has now; however,
   per notes and her son, had been making improvements since that time.
   During her last admission, had extensive neuro work up at that time
   which was largely unrevealing including LP, paraneoplastic labs which
   were negative, SPEP/UPEP, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical
   illness myopathy.
   - subclinical status epilepticus- keppra, phenytoin, follow daily
   phenytoin levels
   - Neuro recs, MRI brain to be coordinated with neuro, currently on 24
   hour EEG monitoring, d/w neuro regarding change from propofol to versed
   given hypotension.
   - Continue Keppra, increase as tolerated.
   - continuous EEG monitoring,
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable - family not willing to
   consent as patient in satus
   .
    #Volume Status: 348 cc UOP yesterday.  Will bolus fluids today for
   increased urine output.
   - bolus for UOP<30cc/hr
   - hold BP meds, bolus as tolerated.
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start reglan standing and senna to assist
   with BM
s and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   .
    # Anemia: Baseline appears to be 27-28.  stable
   .
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - hold BP meds given hypotension and need for propofol.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, hydralazine, lopressor all being HELD
   given hypotension with dilantin/propofol.  Would restart labetalol
   first w/ hydralazine next for afterload reduction.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications including pseudomonal pneumonia, altered mental status, vomiting/regurgitation, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum culture, which is sensitive to cefepime. She should continue receiving cefepime for a seven-day course through [**2115-4-23**] (adjust dose for renal function). Monitoring for improvement in respiratory symptoms and daily cultures should be done.

2. Altered mental status: The patient has been more lethargic over the last three days and was found to be in status epilepticus. The differential diagnosis includes anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest, infection, or underlying seizure disorder (non-convulsive status). It is unclear if generalized toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection, drugs (mildly elevated dilantin level), hypoxia, or from the underlying seizure disorder. The patient is currently sedated with propofol, and EEG monitoring is being continued. The plan includes subclinical status epilepticus management with keppra, phenytoin, and follow-up daily phenytoin levels. An MRI brain should be coordinated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and altered mental status. She was transferred for hypoxia and has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, which is sensitive to cefepime. The patient is also showing signs of anemia, hypertension, and possible toxic metabolic encephalopathy due to infection, drugs, hypoxia, or underlying seizure disorder. She has been experiencing vomiting/regurgitation and has had an aggressive bowel regimen. The patient's current medications include propofol, cefepime, and AC (possibly acetaminophen or another medication). Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 122/56 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has pseudomonal pneumonia, which needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of new infections due to her immunocompromised state.
2. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizures, and she is currently experiencing nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Proper management of her seizure disorder is essential to prevent further seizures and potential complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is relatively low, indicating potential hypotension. Close monitoring and"

   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Pseudomonal pneumonia: Moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum
   cuilture from [**2037-4-14**], sensitive to cefepime.  Blood cultures with
   NGTD, and urine cultures negative.   Moderate AFB on concentrated
   smear, non TB.  Have discontinued respiratory isolation.
   - continue cefepime for a seven day course through [**2115-4-23**] (adjust
   dose for renal function)
   .
    # Altered Mental Status: Ffound to be in sub-clinical status
   epilepticus- unclear etiology.  Differential includes anoxic brain
   injury as patient had a PEA prior to admission, toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection vs drugs (patient had  mildly elevated
   dilantin level), or underlying seizure disorder..  MRI negative for
   mass or infectious focus.   She had a prior admission with similar
   altered mental status, however, EEG was negative at that time.  She had
   an extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing
   including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP,
   MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy.
   - continue midazolam, keppra, phenytoin, follow daily phenytoin levels
   - follow up final read of MRI
   - Follow up EEG read
   - Neuro recs
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable - family not willing to
   consent as patient in satus
   .
    #Volume Status:
   - bolus for UOP<30cc/hr/ MAP <65
   - hold BP meds
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start senna and colace to assist with BM
   and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   .
    # Anemia: Baseline appears to be 27-28.  stable
   .
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, hydralazine, lopressor all being HELD
   given hypotension with dilantin/propofol.  Would restart labetalol
   first w/ hydralazine next for afterload reduction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic ventilator dependence, seizure disorder, and recent hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was transferred for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient's current condition includes subclinical status epilepticus, which is still not fully understood. Imaging and lab tests have not revealed any clear seizure foci, infection, stroke, or other abnormalities.

The patient has moderate pan-sensitive pseudomonas on sputum culture, but blood and urine cultures are negative. She also has moderate acid-fast bacilli on concentrated smear, which is non-TB. Respiratory isolation has been discontinued.

The patient's altered mental status could be due to various factors such as anoxic brain injury, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from infection or drugs, or underlying seizure disorder. An MRI of the brain was negative for mass or infectious focus.

The patient is being treated with midazolam, keppra, and phenytoin for the status epilepticus. Phenytoin levels will be followed daily, and a final read of the MRI will be done. An EEG read and neuro recommendations are also pending.

The patient's volume status is being closely monitored, and she is receiving aggressive bowel regimen to improve vomiting and regurgitation. Her baseline anemia appears to be stable at 27-28%. Hypertension is mostly a problem during breathing trials, and some home medications have been restarted with improvement"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-inch, 63.8 kg male who presented with status epilepticus and respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and received a PICC line on 04/21/2115 at 05:45 PM. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed microvascular ischemic changes. The patient was initially treated with propofol but experienced hypotension and continued seizure activity, leading to the conversion to a midazolam drip at 1 mg/hr. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving various medications, including cefepime, levetiracetam (Keppra), and midazolam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/71 to 100/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 400 mL, set respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 16.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 27.5 g"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-inch, 69 kg individual with a chief complaint of status epilepticus and respiratory failure. They have a history of microvascular ischemic changes on magnetic resonance imaging. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has received various treatments, including propofol for sedation and midazolam for seizure control. They are currently on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 141/71 mmHg to 100/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed due to their status epilepticus. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but other lab values indicate possible organ dysfunction. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics (cefepime), antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and levetiracetam), sedatives (midazolam),"

   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Pseudomonal pneumonia: Moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum
   cuilture from [**2037-4-14**], sensitive to cefepime.  Blood cultures with
   NGTD, and urine cultures negative.   Moderate AFB on concentrated
   smear, non TB.  Have discontinued respiratory isolation.
   - last day of cefepime for a seven day course today [**2115-4-23**]
   .
    # Altered Mental Status: Found to be in sub-clinical status
   epilepticus- unclear etiology.  Differential includes anoxic brain
   injury as patient had a PEA prior to admission, toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection vs drugs (patient had  mildly elevated
   dilantin level), or underlying seizure disorder..  MRI negative for
   mass or infectious focus.   She had a prior admission with similar
   altered mental status, however, EEG was negative at that time.  She had
   an extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing
   including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP,
   MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy.
   - LP today to r/o meningitis, need to obtain consent
   - wean midazolam to 1mg/hr, keppra, phenytoin, follow daily phenytoin
   levels
   - final read of MRI shows L posterior parietal small infarct which is
   likely not contributing to overall picture per neuro
   - Follow up EEG read
   - Neuro recs
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable - family not willing to
   consent as patient in satus
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   - RSBI 285
   - Continue with current ventilator settings
   - daily RSBI with SBT if appropriate
   .
    #Volume Status:
   - patient gradually more overloaded over last week, CXR with pleural
   effusions, will durese with lasix with goal -500 today
   - hold BP meds
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start senna and colace to assist with BM
   and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   .
    # Anemia: Baseline appears to be 27-28.  stable
   .
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, hydralazine, lopressor all being HELD
   given hypotension with dilantin/propofol.  Would restart labetalol
   first w/ hydralazine next for afterload reduction.

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and recent transfer for hypoxia and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia and is currently on a seven-day course of cefepime. The patient's altered mental status is believed to be due to subclinical status epilepticus, but the exact etiology is unclear. An MRI has ruled out any mass or infectious focus. The patient also has a history of similar altered mental status during a prior admission, but an EEG at that time was negative. She has undergone an extensive neuro workup, including LP, paraneoplastic labs, MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy, which were largely unrevealing. The patient's recent labs show a slightly elevated WBC count, normal Hct, and normal Plt. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, with a slightly low TCO2 and low glucose. Other labs indicate elevated CK, CKMB, Troponin-T, LDH, and albumin levels. Imaging studies include daily CXR. The patient's medical conditions include altered mental status, respiratory failure, volume status, vomiting/regurgitation, anemia, and hypertension. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including midazolam, heparin sodium, and various respiratory support measures. She is also receiving nutritional support through TF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and recent transfer for hypoxia and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, for which she was on cefepime therapy. The patient's altered mental status is attributed to subclinical status epilepticus, with an unclear etiology. An MRI ruled out any mass or infectious focus. The patient also has a history of respiratory failure, volume status issues, vomiting/regurgitation, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum culture, which indicates a risk of worsening infection.
2. Status epilepticus: The patient is in subclinical status epilepticus, which requires ongoing management and monitoring to prevent progression to generalized seizures.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as indicated by the low respiratory system compliance and inadequate spontaneous respiratory rate. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
4. Volume status: The patient's fluid balance needs close monitoring due to the risk of both hypovolemia and fluid overload.
5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has been experiencing vomiting and regurgitation, which can lead to aspiration and worsening respiratory status. Management of gastrointestinal symptoms is essential.
6. Anemia: The patient's baseline hemoglobin appears stable, but ongoing monitoring is necessary"

   - Dilantin ongoing
   -Midazolam started for better control of status epilepticus as patient
   still with frequent bursts of seizure activity and hypotension on
   propofol.  Patient with complete control of seizure activity on
   Midazolam and able to wean propofol completely off, currently at 2mg/hr
 but may be able to wean back down to 1 mg/today
   Follow up offical read of MRI with infarct but unlikely to be
   contribting to current issues. Neuro would like LP need consent from
   family.
   Sural nerve Biopsy on hold pending consent from family
   2. Resp Failure: profound weakness, high RSBI. continue on AC for now
   penind KLP but will need to try back on PSV later in day or in AM
   3. PSA PNA:  completing Cefepime course today
   4. Oliguria:  Seems fluid overloaded, doubt hypovolumia, but relative
   [**Name (NI) 2245**] from Antiseizure medications may be contribution.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Pseudomonal pneumonia: Moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum
   cuilture from [**2037-4-14**], sensitive to cefepime.  Blood cultures with
   NGTD, and urine cultures negative.   Moderate AFB on concentrated
   smear, non TB.  Have discontinued respiratory isolation.
   - completed cefepime course [**2115-4-23**]
   .
    # Altered Mental Status: Found to be in sub-clinical status
   epilepticus- unclear etiology.  Differential includes anoxic brain
   injury as patient had a PEA prior to admission, toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection vs drugs (patient had  mildly elevated
   dilantin level), or underlying seizure disorder..  MRI negative for
   mass or infectious focus.   She had a prior admission with similar
   altered mental status, however, EEG was negative at that time.  She had
   an extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing
   including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP,
   MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy.
   - LP yesterday with negative gram stain and WBC 1,
   - wean midazolam to 0.75mg/hr, keppra, phenytoin, follow daily
   phenytoin levels
   - final read of MRI shows L posterior parietal small infarct which is
   likely not contributing to overall picture per neuro
   - Follow up EEG read
   - Neuro recs
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable - family not willing to
   consent as patient in satus
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   - RSBI 146
   - Continue with current ventilator settings
   - daily RSBI with SBT if appropriate
   .
    #Volume Status:
   - patient gradually more overloaded over last week, CXR with pleural
   effusions, will durese with lasix with goal -500 today
   - hold BP meds
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start senna and colace to assist with BM
   and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   .
    # Anemia: Baseline appears to be 27-28.  stable
   .
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, hydralazine, lopressor all being HELD
   given hypotension with dilantin/propofol.  Would restart labetalol
   first w/ hydralazine next for afterload reduction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and transfered for hypoxia and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, for which she has completed a course of cefepime. Her altered mental status is believed to be due to sub-clinical status epilepticus, with unclear etiology. Other differential diagnoses include anoxic brain injury, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from infection or drugs, or underlying seizure disorder. An MRI has ruled out mass or infectious focus. The patient had a previous admission with similar altered mental status, but an EEG was negative at that time. 

The patient's respiratory failure is managed by continuing current ventilator settings and performing daily spontaneous breathing trials if appropriate. Volume status is being addressed by duresis with Lasix to reduce pleural effusions. Vomiting and regurgitation are being managed with an aggressive bowel regimen to improve bowel movements and prevent aspiration. Anemia is stable at baseline levels. Hypertension is being managed with restarted home medications and holding certain blood pressure medications due to hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is currently managed with ventilator support. Potential complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and barotrauma.
2. Pseudomonal Pneumonia: The patient has completed a"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Pseudomonal pneumonia: Moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum
   cuilture from [**2037-4-14**], sensitive to cefepime.  Blood cultures with
   NGTD, and urine cultures negative.   Moderate AFB on concentrated
   smear, non TB.  Have discontinued respiratory isolation.
   - completed cefepime course [**2115-4-23**]
   .
    # Altered Mental Status: Found to be in sub-clinical status
   epilepticus- unclear etiology.  Differential includes anoxic brain
   injury as patient had a PEA prior to admission, toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection vs drugs (patient had  mildly elevated
   dilantin level), or underlying seizure disorder..  MRI negative for
   mass or infectious focus.   She had a prior admission with similar
   altered mental status, however, EEG was negative at that time.  She had
   an extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing
   including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP,
   MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy.
   - LP yesterday with negative gram stain and WBC 1, f/u culure
   - wean midazolam to 0.5mg/hr, keppra, phenytoin, follow daily phenytoin
   levels
   - if no increased EEG activity then decrease to 0.25mg/hr in 6 hours
   - final read of MRI shows L posterior parietal small infarct which is
   likely not contributing to overall picture per neuro
   - Follow up EEG read
   - Neuro recs
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable - family not willing to
   consent as patient in satus
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   - RSBI 146
   - Trial PS with PS 20/PEEP 5 to exercise lungs
   - daily RSBI with SBT if appropriate
   .
    #Volume Status:
   - patient gradually more overloaded over last week, CXR with pleural
   effusions, will diurese with lasix with goal -500 today
   - hold BP meds
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start senna and colace to assist with BM
   and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   .
    # Anemia: Baseline appears to be 27-28.  stable
   .
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, hydralazine, lopressor all being HELD
   given hypotension with dilantin/propofol.  Would restart labetalol
   first w/ hydralazine next for afterload reduction.

The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, which has been treated with cefepime. Blood cultures with NGTD and urine cultures are negative. The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to sub-clinical status epilepticus with an unclear etiology.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture, which was successful without any complications. They are receiving midazolam for sedation, weaning down by 25% every 6 hours. The patient also received cefepime as an antibiotic. Furosemide and heparin sodium are being infused as well.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate ranging from 76-80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/58 mmHg to 154/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight has increased from 69 kg at admission to 73.5 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,766 mL, including 662 mL through the PO, 870 mL through TF, and 416 mL through IVF. The total output is 2,220 mL, consisting of 720 mL through urine, 454 mL through drains, and 58 mL through NG. 

Respiratory support indicates that the patient is on mechanical ventilation in the assist-control mode with a set volume of 400 mL, set rate of 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 146. The ABG results show pH of 7.22, PaCO2 of 22 mmHg, PaO2 of 97 mmHg, HCO3- of 10.0 mEq/L, and BE of -36 mg/dL. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, has PERRL eyes, normal cardiovascular function, clear breath sounds in the chest, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and unresponsive neurologic status with no spontaneous movement but normal tone. 

Laboratory results show WBC count of 243 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, sodium of 107 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride of 22 mEq/L, magnesium of 0.9 mg/dL, calcium of 30.5%, phosphorus of 10.5 K/uL, and blood glucose of 107 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient's previous lab results from April 16th to April 24th show fluctuations in WBC count, hemoglobin, and electrolyte levels. 

The plan for ICU care includes nutrition with Nutren Pulmonary, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is not mentioned in the provided note."

","The patient is a 66-inch, 73.5 kg male who presented with complaints of respiratory failure and status epilepticus. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture on 04/23/2115 at 04:00 PM and an EEG on 04/23/2115 at 08:51 PM. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (0.3 mg/hour), furosemide (Lasix), ranitidine (prophylaxis), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 76-80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92-154 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 146. The plateau pressure is 17 cmH2O, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is 22 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 9.3 to 16.6 K/uL,"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
    # Altered Mental Status: Found to be in sub-clinical status
   epilepticus- unclear etiology.  Differential includes anoxic brain
   injury as patient had a PEA prior to admission, toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection vs drugs (patient had  mildly elevated
   dilantin level), or underlying seizure disorder..  MRI negative for
   mass or infectious focus.   She had a prior admission with similar
   altered mental status, however, EEG was negative at that time.  She had
   an extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing
   including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP,
   MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy.
   Persistent status epilepticus upon trying to wean of versed
   - LP cx ngtd
   - patient now on pentobarbitol gtt given persistent NCSE
   - continue keppra and dilantin, levels at target goal
   - final read of MRI shows L posterior parietal small infarct which is
   likely not contributing to overall picture per neuro
   - Follow up EEG read
   - Neuro recs
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable - family not willing to
   consent as patient in status

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence, transferred for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
- She was found to be in sub-clinical status epilepticus with unclear etiology, and her differential includes anoxic brain injury, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from infection vs drugs, or underlying seizure disorder.
- MRI was negative for mass or infectious focus. She had a prior admission with similar altered mental status, but EEG was negative at that time.
- She has been on versed gtt, and persistent NCSE prompted the initiation of pentobarbital gtt. She is also on keppra and dilantin, with levels at target goal.
- A small infarct in the L posterior parietal region was found on MRI, which is likely not contributing to the overall picture per neuro.
- Follow-up EEG read and neuro recs are pending.
- Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy is planned once stable, but the family is not willing to consent as the patient is in status.
- The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with current vent settings, and daily RSBI with SBT is planned if appropriate.
- The patient has been gradually overloaded over the last week, with pleural effusions seen on CXR. Diuresis with lasix is being initiated with a goal of -500 today.
- BP meds have been held due to hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   # Pseudomonal pneumonia: Moderate growth of pseudomonas on sputum
   cuilture from [**2037-4-14**], sensitive to cefepime.  Blood cultures with
   NGTD, and urine cultures negative.   Moderate AFB on concentrated
   smear, non TB.  Have discontinued respiratory isolation.
   - completed cefepime course [**2115-4-23**]
   .
    # Altered Mental Status: Found to be in sub-clinical status
   epilepticus- unclear etiology.  Differential includes anoxic brain
   injury as patient had a PEA prior to admission, toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection vs drugs (patient had  mildly elevated
   dilantin level), or underlying seizure disorder..  MRI negative for
   mass or infectious focus.   She had a prior admission with similar
   altered mental status, however, EEG was negative at that time.  She had
   an extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing
   including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP,
   MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy.
   - LP yesterday with negative gram stain and WBC 1, f/u culure
   - wean midazolam to 0.5mg/hr, keppra, phenytoin, follow daily phenytoin
   levels
   - if no increased EEG activity then decrease to 0.25mg/hr in 6 hours
   - final read of MRI shows L posterior parietal small infarct which is
   likely not contributing to overall picture per neuro
   - Follow up EEG read
   - Neuro recs
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable - family not willing to
   consent as patient in satus
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   - RSBI 146
   - Trial PS with PS 20/PEEP 5 to exercise lungs
   - daily RSBI with SBT if appropriate
   .
    #Volume Status:
   - patient gradually more overloaded over last week, CXR with pleural
   effusions, will diurese with lasix with goal -500 today
   - hold BP meds
   .
   # Vomiting/regurgitation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the
   [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration.
   S/p aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start senna and colace to assist with BM
   and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, currently having BMs
   .
    # Anemia: Baseline appears to be 27-28.  stable
   .
   # Hypertension: Per history hypertension mostly a problem during
   breathing trials. Was initially normotensive in the setting of
   dehydration and potential infection so BP meds held.  Restarted on some
   home meds with some improvement in blood pressure.
   - Labetalol 800 TID, clonidine, hydralazine, lopressor all being HELD

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and previous admission for altered mental status. She was transferred for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, which was sensitive to cefepime, and has completed the antibiotic course. She is also suspected to have sub-clinical status epilepticus with an unclear etiology. The patient's mental status is being closely monitored, and she is being weaned off midazolam with plans to decrease the dosage if there is no increased EEG activity. An MRI shows a small infarct in the left posterior parietal region, which is unlikely to be contributing to her overall picture. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, and efforts are being made to improve her lung function through daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and pressure support ventilation (PS). She has pleural effusions on chest X-ray and is being diuresed with lasix to remove excess fluid. The patient also has issues with vomiting and regurgitation, which have led to worsening residuals and aspiration. An aggressive bowel regimen has been initiated to address this issue. Additionally, the patient has anemia and hypertension, both of which are being managed accordingly."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the information:

1. Chief Complaint: The patient's chief complaint is status epilepticus, which refers to a prolonged seizure episode that does not return to normal consciousness between seizures.

2. Allergies: The patient has no known drug allergies.

3. Infusions and Medications: The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 0.5 mg/hour, furosemide (Lasix), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include Versed GTTS.

4. Review of Systems: The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of respiratory support.

5. Vital Signs: The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/70 mmHg to 105/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

6. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a total of 2,298 mL of fluids since midnight, with 1,040 mL given through the gastrointestinal tract, 768 mL through intravenous fluids, and 300 mL through enteral nutrition. The total output includes 1,600 mL of urine, 1,685 mL of blood products, and -782 mL of drain output.

7. Respiratory Support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 40%, and the spontaneous respiratory rate is 5 breaths per minute.

8. Neurologic Examination: The patient responds to noxious stimuli only and exhibits fair air movement with bibasilar rales on chest examination. The tracheostomy site is present, and the right eye is closed with gauze overlying.

9. Lab Results: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, normal electrolyte levels, and abnormal arterial blood gas values.

10. Assessment and Plan:
   - Status Epilepticus: The patient's refractory status epilepticus has been identified, and pentobarbital coma is being initiated. The plan is to wean off Versed after the pentobarbital load and increase the dose by 0.5 mg/hour for persistent activity. Dilantin levels are being monitored and adjusted for albumin.
   - Respiratory Failure: The patient requires full respiratory support due to profound weakness and failed positive pressure ventilation (PSV) yesterday.
   - PSA PNA: The patient has completed the course of cefipime, and secretions have increased. A repeat chest X-ray and sputum sample will be sent.
   - Volume Overload: The goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of 500 cc per day, monitor central venous pressure (CVP) and bicarbonate levels, and perform daily weights.
   - Anemia: The patient has chronic and stable anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic illness and respiratory support increases the risk of infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.

2. Bleeding: The low platelet count and the use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin sodium increase the risk of bleeding complications.

3. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates potential kidney dysfunction, which can worsen due to inadequate fluid management or medication toxicity.

4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory failure and dependence on mechanical ventilation increase the risk of further respiratory distress and complications like ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

5. Seizure recurrence: Despite the initiation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and recent transfer for hypoxia and altered mental status. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on a ventilator with a low respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 170, indicating the need for continued mechanical ventilation support.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been diagnosed with sub-clinical status epilepticus, and the underlying cause is unclear. The differential includes anoxic brain injury, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from infection vs drugs, or an underlying seizure disorder. Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypotension related to dilantin and diuresis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adjustment of medications are necessary.
4. Volume Status: The patient has a total body overload, and diuresis is being used to manage fluid balance. However, multiple AED medications are causing hypotension, and careful monitoring of fluid status is required.
5. Constipation: The patient has had worsening residuals, vomiting, and aspiration due to constipation. An aggressive bowel regimen has been initiated, and medications such as senna and colace will be used to facilitate bowel movements and prevent further aspiration.
6. Anemia: The patient's baseline hemoglobin level is stable at"

   difficultly seeing his mother this ill and at times even communicating
   with the medical team. As such, it makes his role as HCP challenging.
   [**Name2 (NI) **] looks to his brother [**Name (NI) 2429**] for support who is equally saddened by
   his mothers condition but more able to participate in conversations
   about her poevrall poor prognosis. We will try to set up a meeting with
   [**Doctor Last Name 435**] and Ralp over the weekend and we will need to have a bigger
   meeting with MICU and Neuro teams next week.
   We would like to bring Palliative Care on board when family would seem

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with ongoing status epilepticus, respiratory failure, and potential complications related to volume overload, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is currently in a pentobarb coma, has profound weakness leading to respiratory failure, and exhibits signs of volume overload such as bilateral effusion. The patient's condition is being managed in the ICU with various interventions including mechanical ventilation, medication infusions, and prophylactic measures. The patient's family is being supported by the medical team, and discussions regarding end-of-life decisions are taking place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient's refractory status epilepticus has led to the initiation of pentobarb coma. However, there is difficulty maintaining hemodynamics during antiepileptic transfusions.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory muscles are weak, resulting in failure of partial support ventilation and the need for full respiratory support.
3. Volume overload: The patient shows signs of fluid accumulation, as evidenced by bilateral effusion. Diuretic therapy may be necessary to manage this condition.
4. Anemia: Chronic and stable anemia is present, which may contribute to the patient's overall weakness and compromised condition.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: Abnormalities in potassium, sodium, and magnesium levels may require careful monitoring and correction to avoid complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is status epilepticus. The patient is currently in a pentobarb coma and being treated with multiple anti-epileptic drugs. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a trend of decreasing blood pressures, particularly during anti-epileptic drug infusions, requiring IV fluid boluses. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST mode, set Vt of 400 mL, RR set at 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 170. 

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral edema, diminished breath sounds, trace edema in both extremities, muscle wasting, and unresponsiveness with sedation. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low platelet count, low sodium, high potassium, and elevated BUN and creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has been diagnosed with status epilepticus, profound respiratory failure, volume overload, chronic stable anemia, and poor prognosis. The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Increasing WBC count, new fever concerning for partially
   treated pseudomonal pneumonia given 2+ GNR in sputum and previous LLL
   infiltrate that has not fully cleared.  Also with risk of C. Diff given
   recent antibiotics.  Also with lines concerning for possible line
   infection.
   -          Will cover broadly with vanc/cefepime/cipro and PO vanco.
   Obtain stool, sputum, blood , urine, daily CXR.
   -          Consider repeat CT chest for ? consolidation noted
   previously.
   -          Levophed for BP support as per below.
   #Hypotension: Increasing pressure support yesterday thought [**1-19**] to
   anti-epileptic medications, but given new WBC count and fever may be
   component of sepsis as well.  Patient is hypervolemic on exam with low
   albumin which may suggest possible component of intravascular
   depletion.
   -          Continue pressors today.  Patient felt to be
full tanked
   yesterday and clearly is hypervolemic on exam so would not push fluids
   aggressively at this time.
   -          MAP goal of 60.

    # Altered Mental Status: Found to be in sub-clinical status
   epilepticus- unclear etiology.  Differential includes anoxic brain
   injury as patient had a PEA prior to admission, toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection vs drugs (patient had  mildly elevated
   dilantin level), or underlying seizure disorder..  MRI negative for
   mass or infectious focus.   She had a prior admission with similar
   altered mental status, however, EEG was negative at that time.  She had
   an extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing
   including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP,
   MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy.
   Persistent status epilepticus upon trying to wean of versed.  Now on
   pentobarb gtt and in burst suppression.
   - Wean pentobarb gtt as per neurology
   - LP cx ngtd
   - continue keppra and dilantin, levels at target goal
   - final read of MRI shows L posterior parietal small infarct which is
   likely not contributing to overall picture per neuro
   - Neuro recs
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable - family not willing to
   consent as patient in status
   .
   -
   # Respiratory failure: Diuresis would likely improve respiratory
   status, but given hypotension will not pursue diuresis today.
   - continue current vent settings, vent dependent
   - daily RSBI with SBT if appropriate
   - sputum 2+ GNR, 1+GPR, will treat for HAP with vanc/pseudomonas/cipro
   and peel coverage on basis of culture data.
   .
   # Constipation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration. S/p
   aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start senna and colace to assist with BM
   and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, optimize regimen, 2 BM yesterday

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. She was transferred for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient's current condition includes low blood pressure, anasarca (swelling caused by fluid accumulation), respiratory failure, altered mental status, constipation, and anemia. The patient is currently on several medications including pentobarbital, norepinephrine, heparin, ranitidine, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis (increasing white blood cell count) and fever, which could indicate an infection. The presence of GNR in sputum and previous lung infiltrate suggests a possible pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient is also at risk for Clostridium difficile infection due to recent antibiotic use.
2. Line Infection: The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line and a central venous catheter. There is a concern for possible line infection, which can lead to bloodstream infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is being supported with norepinephrine. Hypotension can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is ventilator-dependent and has coarse breath sounds anteriorly, suggesting possible pneumonia or atelectasis. Respiratory failure can lead to further hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder and chronic ventilator dependence. She was transferred for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient has been in sub-clinical status epilepticus with an unclear etiology. Differential diagnoses include anoxic brain injury, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from infection versus drugs, or underlying seizure disorder. MRI was negative for mass or infectious focus. The patient had a prior admission with similar altered mental status, but EEG was negative at that time. She underwent an extensive neuro workup which was largely unrevealing. 

The patient has persistent status epilepticus and is currently on pentobarbital to achieve burst suppression. She is also on keppra and dilantin, with levels at target goal. A final read of MRI shows a small infarct in the left posterior parietal region, which is likely not contributing to the overall picture according to neurology. Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy is recommended once the patient is stable, but the family is not willing to consent as the patient is in status.

The patient has leukocytosis, respiratory failure due to diuresis, volume status/hypotension with total body overload, and constipation. The goals of care include planning a family meeting to establish long-term goals of care, code status, and prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old F with history a seizure disorder, chronic vent dependence
   transfered for hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Increasing WBC count, new fever concerning for partially
   treated pseudomonal pneumonia given 2+ GNR in sputum and previous LLL
   infiltrate that has not fully cleared.  Also with risk of C. Diff given
   recent antibiotics.  Also with lines concerning for possible line
   infection.
   -          Will cover broadly with vanc/cefepime/cipro and PO vanco.
   Obtain stool, sputum, blood , urine, daily CXR.
   -          Consider repeat CT chest for ? consolidation noted
   previously.
   -          Levophed for BP support as per below.
   #Hypotension: Increasing pressure support yesterday thought [**1-19**] to
   anti-epileptic medications, but given new WBC count and fever may be
   component of sepsis as well.  Patient is hypervolemic on exam with low
   albumin which may suggest possible component of intravascular
   depletion.
   -          Continue pressors today.  Patient felt to be
full tanked
   yesterday and clearly is hypervolemic on exam so would not push fluids
   aggressively at this time.
   -          MAP goal of 60.
   .
    # Altered Mental Status: Found to be in sub-clinical status
   epilepticus- unclear etiology.  Differential includes anoxic brain
   injury as patient had a PEA prior to admission, toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from infection vs drugs (patient had  mildly elevated
   dilantin level), or underlying seizure disorder..  MRI negative for
   mass or infectious focus.   She had a prior admission with similar
   altered mental status, however, EEG was negative at that time.  She had
   an extensive neuro work up at that time which was largely unrevealing
   including LP, paraneoplastic labs which were negative, SPEP/UPEP,
   MRI/MRA brain, EMG concerning for critical illness myopathy.
   Persistent status epilepticus upon trying to wean of versed.  Now on
   pentobarb gtt and in burst suppression.
   - Wean pentobarb gtt as per neurology
   - LP cx ngtd
   - continue keppra and dilantin, levels at target goal
   - final read of MRI shows L posterior parietal small infarct which is
   likely not contributing to overall picture per neuro
   - Neuro recs
   - Sural nerve biopsy for neuropathy once stable - family not willing to
   consent as patient in status
   .
   -
   # Respiratory failure: Diuresis would likely improve respiratory
   status, but given hypotension will not pursue diuresis today.
   - continue current vent settings, vent dependent
   - daily RSBI with SBT if appropriate
   - sputum 2+ GNR, 1+GPR, will treat for HAP with vanc/pseudomonas/cipro
   and peel coverage on basis of culture data.
   .
   # Constipation: Had KUB on admission showing stool in the [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   have led to worsening residuals, vomiting and aspiration. S/p
   aggressive bowel regimen with BM at this time.  Regurgitation also
   improved at this time.  Will start senna and colace to assist with BM
   and avoid precipitating further aspiration.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen, optimize regimen, 2 BM yesterday
   - Kayexelate today for K 5.2 this AM.
   .
    # Anemia: Baseline appears to be 27-28.  stable
   .
   # Goals care: family meeting to be planned for tomorrow with neurology
   and ICU team to establish long terms goals of care, code status and
   prognosis
   -          SW consult, patient relations.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, chronic ventilator dependence, and previous hospital admissions. She was transferred for hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including leukocytosis, hypotension, altered mental status, respiratory failure, constipation, anemia, and potential infections such as pseudomonal pneumonia and Clostridium difficile.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure, normal heart rate, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. She has been on several medications including pentobarbital, norepinephrine, heparin, ranitidine, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime.

Her physical examination reveals a distended abdomen, peripheral edema, and coarse breath sounds anteriorly. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's imaging shows stable moderate bilateral effusions and atelectasis on chest X-ray. She has also had multiple cultures taken including blood, urine, and sputum, which show the presence of GNR bacteria in the sputum.

The patient's current plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for suspected infections, pressor support for blood pressure management, weaning off pentobarbital gtt, and further evaluation for potential causes of altered"

   chest wall restriction), sz d/o, and recent neurologic decline of
   unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed ?sz
   w/altered mental status and hypoxemia.  Notably, on day PTA, suffered
   PEA arrest in setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging.  Resp status
   improved somewhat (tol PS not TC).  MS initially improved but then
   worse- EEG on [**4-19**] revealed non-convulsive status, reloaded w/dilantin
   but continued szs so added keppra and versed gtt.  Szs cont, so put
   into pentobarb coma on [**4-25**] (cont dilantin and keppra, versed off)-
   pentobarb gtt uptitrated until finally burst suppressed on [**4-26**]- plan to

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, chest wall restriction, and recent neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging and required intubation. Her respiratory status improved somewhat, but her mental status worsened. An EEG on 4/19 revealed non-convulsive status epilepticus, and she was reloaded with dilantin. Despite continued seizures, she was placed into pentobarb coma on 4/25 and finally burst suppressed on 4/26. The plan is to continue pentobarb coma for 24 hours and then gradually pull back. She will also continue on Keppra and Dilantin. Neurology follow-up is recommended due to poor prognosis. Sural nerve biopsy has been put on hold pending consent from the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient continues to experience seizures despite being on anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). She is currently in pentobarb coma, which may have its own complications such as hypotension and potential for infection. Close monitoring of hemodynamics during AED transfusions is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has profound weakness and failed PSV (pressure"

The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, on ventilator support. She has a history of post-polio syndrome versus chest wall restriction, seizure disorder, and recent neurological decline of unclear etiology. The patient was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. She suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging. Respiratory status improved somewhat, but the patient's mental status initially improved and then worsened. An EEG on 04/19 revealed non-convulsive status, and the patient was reloaded with dilantin but continued seizures. Keppra and versed were added, but the seizures continued, so the patient was put into a pentobarb coma on 04/25 (continuing dilantin and keppra, versed off). The pentobarb gtt was uptitrated until finally burst suppressed on 04/26, with plans to continue x24hrs, then pull back. A brain MRI and LP on 04/23 were unremarkable. The patient now has difficulty with low BPs during anti-epileptic transfusions - bolusing but may need a pressor. Full vent support is required while in status.

   76 yo F w/chronic resp failure on vent (?NM (post polio syndrome) vs.
   chest wall restriction), sz d/o, and recent neurologic decline of
   unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed ?sz
   w/altered mental status and hypoxemia.  Found to be in status
   epilepticus.  Now finally burst suppressed after induction of pentobarb
   coma.
   Notably, on day PTA, suffered PEA arrest in setting of hypoxemia/mucous
   plugging.  Resp status improved somewhat (tol PS not TC).  MS initially
   improved but then worse- EEG on [**4-19**] revealed non-convulsive status,
   reloaded w/dilantin but continued szs so added keppra and versed gtt.
   Szs cont, so put into pentobarb coma on [**4-25**] (cont dilantin and keppra,
   versed off)- pentobarb gtt uptitrated until finally burst suppressed on
   [**4-26**]- plan to cont x24hrs, then pull back.  Brain MRI and LP ([**4-23**])
   unremarkable. Unfortunately, now having difficulty w/low BPs during
   anti-epileptic transfusions- bolusing but may need pressor.   Full vent
   support while in status.  Prognosis poor- family mting [**4-29**] w/neuro.
   Of note, sputum AFB+, MTB PCR neg.
   1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: finally burst suppressed on
   pentobarb.  Plan to cont pentobarb coma x24hrs and then pull back.
   Also continues on Keppra and Dilantin.  f/u neuro recs.  Prognosis
   poor.
   2. Resp Failure: profound weakness of unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] (had planned for
   sural nerve bx- but currently on hold while addressing status
   epilepticus), failed PSV 3 days ago and now needs full vent support
   while in status.  Slightly decreased sats last night- CXR relatively
   stable- definitely vol overloaded with b/l pleural effusions but cannot
   diurese now given pressor requirement.  Partially rx
d VAP may also
   contribute.
   3. Hypotension: [**1-19**] AEDs +/- infection (fever and WBC bump this am).
   Titrate levophed to MAP >60.  Pan cx
d, empiric abx as below.
   4. New leukocystosis/fevers: potential sources= partially rx'd pna
   (sputum cx pos), c diff (has gotten multiple abx), line infection, and
   UTI.  Broadly cx'd and c diff sent, will empirically cover with IV
   vanc/cefepime/cipro/po vanco.
   5. Difficult communication w/family: SW following.  Will consider
   involving risk management.  Plan for family meeting [**4-29**] w/neurology as
   well to discuss prognosis.  Would also like to involve palliative care,
   but family not currently ready.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient has been experiencing ongoing seizures despite being on multiple anti-epileptic medications. They have been induced into a pentobarbital coma to control the seizures, but the prognosis is poor.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to profound weakness. They failed pressure support ventilation (PSV) and now require full ventilatory support. There is also evidence of volume overload with bilateral pleural effusions, which cannot be managed with diuretics due to the need for pressor support.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, possibly related to the administration of anti-epileptic drugs or infection. Pressors are being titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically.

4. New leukocystosis/fevers: The patient has developed leukocystosis and fever, which may be due to various potential sources such as pneumonia (sputum culture positive), Clostridium difficile infection, line infection, or urinary tract infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

5. Difficult communication with family: The patient's family is having difficulty understanding the severity of the situation, and social work support has been provided. A family meeting is planned"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, chest wall restriction, seizure disorder, and recent neurological decline. She was admitted after experiencing tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging. Her respiratory status improved, but she continued to experience seizures, leading to the initiation of pentobarbital coma. Brain MRI and lumbar puncture were unremarkable. The patient has difficulty with low blood pressures during anti-epileptic transfusions and requires pressor support. She is on full ventilatory support while in status. The prognosis is poor, as indicated by the family meeting with a neurologist. Sputum AFB+ (acid-fast bacilli positive), indicating possible tuberculosis infection, but MTB PCR (mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction) is negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on full ventilatory support, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head of bed elevation and regular mouth care should be implemented to reduce the risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings or pharmacological intervention, should be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo F w/chronic resp failure on vent (?NM (post polio syndrome) vs.
   chest wall restriction), sz d/o, and recent neurologic decline of
   unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed ?sz
   w/altered mental status and hypoxemia.  Found to be in status
   epilepticus.  Now finally burst suppressed after induction of pentobarb
   coma.
   Notably, on day PTA, suffered PEA arrest in setting of hypoxemia/mucous
   plugging.  Resp status improved somewhat (tol PS not TC).  MS initially
   improved but then worsened - EEG on [**4-19**] revealed non-convulsive status,
   reloaded w/dilantin but continued seizures so added keppra and versed
   gtt.  Seizures continued, so decision was made to put into pentobarb
   coma on [**4-25**] (cont dilantin and keppra, versed off). Pentobarb gtt was
   uptitrated until finally burst suppressed on [**4-26**]- plan to cont x24hrs,
   then pull back.  Brain MRI and LP ([**4-23**]) unremarkable. Since [**4-26**],
   hypotension requiring IVFs and initiation of norepinephrine.   Full
   vent support while in status.  Prognosis poor- family mting [**4-29**]
   w/neuro.  Of note, sputum AFB+, mTD PCR probe neg.
   1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: burst suppressed on pentobarb
   since yesterday.  Plan to cont pentobarb coma x24hrs and then pull
   back.  Also continues on Keppra and Dilantin.  f/u neuro recs.
   2. Resp Failure: weakness of unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] (had planned for sural nerve
   bx- but currently on hold while addressing status epilepticus), failed
   PSV 3 days ago and now needs full vent support while in status.
   Slightly decreased sats last night- CXR relatively stable. Appears to
   be volume overloaded with b/l pleural effusions but difficult to
   diurese now given pressor requirement.  Partially rx
d VAP may also
   contribute.
   3. Hypotension: [**1-19**] AEDs +/- infection (fever and WBC bump this am).
   Titrate levophed to MAP >60.  Pan cx
d, empiric abx as below.
   4. New leukocystosis/fevers: potential sources include partially rx'd
   pna (sputum cx pos with GNR), c diff (has gotten multiple abx), line
   infection (though new PICC [**4-25**]), and UTI.  Broadly cx'd and c diff
   sent, will empirically cover with IV vanc/cefepime/cipro/po vanco.
   5. Family discussions: sons have been updated, social work following.
   Plan for family meeting [**4-29**] w/neurology as well to discuss prognosis.
   Would also like to involve palliative care, but family not currently
   ready.

   Total time spent: 35 min CC time, Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, possibly due to post-polio syndrome or chest wall restriction, who presented with status epilepticus. She has been admitted multiple times and experienced a recent neurological decline. The patient suffered from tube feed aspiration and a witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. She also experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging.

The patient's respiratory status has shown improvement but she remains on full ventilator support. Her mental status initially improved but then worsened, and an EEG on 04-19 revealed non-convulsive status epilepticus. Despite being loaded with dilantin and keppra, and receiving versed gtt, the seizures continued. As a result, the decision was made to put the patient into a pentobarb coma on 04-25 (continuing dilantin and keppra, versed off). The pentobarb gtt was uptitrated until the patient finally became burst suppressed on 04-26. The plan is to continue the pentobarb coma for 24 hours, then gradually pull back.

The patient's brain MRI and lumbar puncture (LP) on 04-23 were unremarkable. Since 04-26, the patient has required hypotension treatment with intravenous fluids (IVFs) and initiation of norepinephrine. The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure who is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaints include non-convulsive seizures, new fevers/leukocytosis, and hypotension. 

The patient has a history of tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizures with altered mental status and hypoxemia. She also suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging. 

The patient's current condition includes non-convulsive status epilepticus, which was finally suppressed on pentobarbital for 24 hours on 04/27. She is being weaned off pentobarbital and will continue on Keppra and dilantin. 

She also has hypotension, possibly secondary to anti-epileptics or sepsis from new hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Levophed has been started to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. 

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI), as indicated by a positive urine analysis (UA), and will continue on cefepime. Pseudomonas is present on sputum culture, along with moderate acid-fast bacilli (AFB). HSV PCR is pending. 

Additionally, the patient has vomiting, with KUB showing dilated loops of large bowel and stool, but no dilated small bowel, free air, or air"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, experiencing non-convulsive seizures, new fevers/leukocytosis, and hypotension. She has a history of post-polio syndrome, chest wall restriction, and recent neurological decline. The patient suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to hypoxemia/mucous plugging and required resuscitation. She has been in a non-convulsive status epilepticus, unresponsive to antiepileptic drugs, and was placed in a pentobarbital coma. The patient's brain MRI and lumbar puncture were unremarkable. She has sputum AFB positivity but negative MTB PCR. 

The patient's current issues include non-convulsive status epilepticus, profound respiratory failure, volume overload, hypotension, and anemia. The new leukocytosis and fevers may be caused by partially treated pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, line infection, or urinary tract infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is currently in a pentobarbital coma to control seizures. The plan is to continue the coma for 24 hours and then gradually withdraw it. She will also continue on Keppra and Dilantin.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has deterior"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo F w/chronic resp failure on vent (?NM (post polio syndrome) vs.
   chest wall restriction), sz d/o, and recent neurologic decline of
   unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed ?sz
   w/altered mental status and hypoxemia.  Found to be in non-convulsive
   status epilepticus.  Now finally burst suppressed after induction of
   pentobarb coma.  Course further c/b hypotension, requiring pressors and
   ARF.
   1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: burst suppressed on pentobarb x24
   hrs on [**4-27**], now tapering pentobarb.  Also continues on Keppra and
   Dilantin.  EEG leads to be changed given sig artifact.  f/u neuro
   recs.
   2. Resp Failure: weakness of unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] (had planned for sural nerve
   bx- but currently on hold while addressing status epilepticus), failed
   PSV several days ago.  Worsening oxygenation likely [**1-19**] vol
   overload/effusions, VAP, and ?aspiration this am.  Abx as below.  No
   diuresis while getting pressors.
   3. Hypotension: [**1-19**] AEDs + infection (fever and WBC bump this am).
   Titrate levophed to MAP >60.  Has not responded to IVF boluses.  Pan
   cx
d, empiric abx as below.  Needs CVL for better assessment of
   intrvascular volume status and hemodynamics.
   Will be able to assess CYP, SCVo2
   4. Leukocystosis/fevers: likely [**1-19**] pseudomonal VAP and UTI.  Cont
   cipro and cefepime.  f/u cxs.  D/c IV and po vanco.
   5. Vomiting: unclear when last BM.  Hold TF for now.  Check KUB.  Will
   also check head CT given vomiting and L pupil no longer reacting.
   6. ARF (virtually anuric): likely intrvasc vol depleted depsite total
   body vol overloaded (hypoalbuminemic)/ATN/infection.  Check FeBUN,
   urine eos, renal U/S.  PIPs not elevated to suggest intrabdominal
   hypertension
 but check bladder pressure.
   Renally dose meds for CR Cl of zero.
   7. Family discussions: sons have been updated, social work following.
   Plan for family meeting [**4-29**] w/neurology as well to discuss prognosis.
   Would also like to involve palliative care, but family not currently
   ready.  Possible transfer to [**Hospital1 1244**] tomorrow but this will be extremely
   complaicted as a MICU case requiring neurology following most likely.
   8. Access - 2XPIV, PICC w/one functioning lumen.  CVL- will t/b with

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, on mechanical ventilation, and a history of post-polio syndrome versus chest wall restriction. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient was found to be in non-convulsive status epilepticus and is now burst-suppressed after induction of pentobarb coma. The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, requiring pressors and acute respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:

1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient was burst-suppressed on pentobarb for 24 hours on 04-27 and is now tapering pentobarb. She continues on Keppra and Dilantin. EEG leads need to be changed given significant artifact. Follow-up neuro recommendations.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's weakness of unclear etiology (had planned for sural nerve bx- but currently on hold while addressing status epilepticus), failed PSV several days ago. Worsening oxygenation is likely due to volume overload/effusions, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and possible aspiration this morning. Antibiotics have been started as below. No diuresis while getting pressors.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had persistent hypotension despite IV fluids and pressors. Titrate levophed to MAP >60. Has not responded to IVF boluses."

   plugging.  Resp status improved somewhat (tol PS not TC).  MS initially
   improved but then worsened - EEG on [**4-19**] revealed non-convulsive status,
   reloaded w/dilantin but continued seizures so added keppra and versed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, experiencing status epilepticus and recent neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient suffered a cardiac arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging, resulting in improved respiratory status but worsening mental status. An EEG revealed non-convulsive status epilepticus, and she was treated with dilantin, keppra, and versed. Despite continued seizures, the decision was made to induce pentobarb coma on 4/25. The patient's brain MRI and LP were unremarkable. Since 4/26, she has required IV fluids and initiation of norepinephrine for hypotension. The patient is currently on full vent support while in status. Prognosis is poor, with plans for a family meeting on 4/29 with neurology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient continues to experience seizures despite being on pentobarb coma. There is a need to monitor the patient closely for any signs of breakthrough seizures and adjust medication doses accordingly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, requiring full ventilator support. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), aspiration, and volutrauma due to high tidal volumes. Monitoring of oxygenation"

   76 yo F w/chronic resp failure on vent (?NM (post polio syndrome) vs.
   chest wall restriction), sz d/o, and recent neurologic decline of
   unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed ?sz
   w/altered mental status and hypoxemia.  Found to be in status
   epilepticus.  Now finally burst suppressed after induction of pentobarb
   coma.
   Notably, on day PTA, suffered PEA arrest in setting of hypoxemia/mucous
   plugging.  Resp status improved somewhat (tol PS not TC).  MS initially
   improved but then worsened - EEG on [**4-19**] revealed non-convulsive status,
   reloaded w/dilantin but continued seizures so added keppra and versed
   gtt.  Seizures continued, so decision was made to put into pentobarb
   coma on [**4-25**] (cont dilantin and keppra, versed off). Pentobarb gtt was
   uptitrated until finally burst suppressed on [**4-26**]- plan to cont x24hrs,
   then pull back.  Brain MRI and LP ([**4-23**]) unremarkable. Since [**4-26**],
   hypotension requiring IVFs and initiation of norepinephrine.   Full
   vent support while in status.  Prognosis poor- family mting [**4-29**]

   1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: burst suppressed on pentobarb x24
   hrs, now tapering pentobarb.  Also continues on Keppra and Dilantin.
   EEG leads to be changed given sig artifact.  f/u neuro recs.
   2. Resp Failure: weakness of unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] (had planned for sural nerve
   bx- but currently on hold while addressing status epilepticus), failed
   PSV several days ago and now needs full vent support while in status.
   Worsening oxygenation likely [**1-19**] vol overload/effusions, VAP, and
   ?aspiration.  Abx as below.  No diuresis while getting pressors.

   5. Vomiting: unclear when last BM.  Hold TF for now.  Check KUB.  Will
   also check head CT given vomiting and L pupil no longer reacting.
   6. ARF: likely ATN/infection/low alb.  Check FeBUN.  Renally dose meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, status epilepticus, and recent neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging, but her respiratory status improved somewhat. However, her mental status initially improved but then worsened, and an EEG revealed non-convulsive status. Despite being loaded with dilantin, the seizures continued, so additional medications were added. Eventually, the decision was made to induce a pentobarbital coma on April 25th, which successfully suppressed the seizures. The patient's brain MRI and lumbar puncture were unremarkable. Since April 26th, the patient has required intravenous fluids and the initiation of norepinephrine due to hypotension. The patient is currently on full ventilatory support while in status. Prognosis is poor, and the family meeting is scheduled for April 29th with a neurologist.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient continues to be burst suppressed on pentobarbital x24 hours, now tapering pentobarbital. She also continues on Keppra and Dilantin. EEG leads need to be changed given significant artifact. Follow-up with neuro recommendations.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, status epilepticus, and recent neurologic decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient suffered from a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging. Respiratory status improved somewhat, but the patient's mental status initially improved and then worsened. An electroencephalogram (EEG) on 4/19 revealed non-convulsive status, and the patient was reloaded with dilantin but continued seizures. The patient was then added on keppra and versed gtt. Seizures continued, so a decision was made to put the patient into pentobarb coma on 4/25 (continuing dilantin and keppra, versed off). Pentobarb gtt was uptitrated until finally burst suppressed on 4/26 - plan to continue x24hrs, then pull back. A brain MRI and lumbar puncture (LP) on 4/23 were unremarkable. Since 4/26, the patient has been hypotensive requiring IVFs and initiation of norepinephrine. The patient has been on full vent support while in status. Prognosis is poor, and the family meeting is scheduled on 4/29 with neurology to discuss prognosis. The patient also has sput"

   Has had MINIMAL urine output, non-responsive to fluid boluses.  We met
   with the family and they consented to a central line, so I placed a
   right IJ.  Her CVP was 13 on 10 of PEEP, so we gave her another 500cc
   bolus, but it is likely that she has anuric renal failure from ATN.  I
   put in an order to remove her PICC line.
   -She is ordered for a renal ultrasound, urine lytes, and eosinophils to
   complete the full work-up
   -There was a question of a non-reactive pupil from nursing, we ordered
   a head CT which showed nothing acute
   -Pentobarbital has been weaned to 1 successfully!
   -No BM for several days, abdomen is becoming distended and firm.  She
   was manually disimpacted overnight, which revealed impacted stool in
   the rectal vault with BRB and proximally.  There is nothing left to
   disimpact so we wrote her for go lytely

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo F w/chronic resp failure on vent (?NM (post polio syndrome) vs.
   chest wall restriction), sz d/o, and recent neurologic decline of
   unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed ?sz
   w/altered mental status and hypoxemia.  Found to be in non-convulsive
   status epilepticus.  Notably, on day PTA, suffered PEA arrest in
   setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging.  Resp status improved somewhat
   (tol PS not TC).  MS initially improved but then worse- EEG on [**4-19**]
   revealed non-convulsive status, which has been refractory, requiring
   initiation of a pentobarb comaNow finally burst suppressed after
   induction of pentobarb coma.  Course further c/b hypotension, requiring
   pressors and ARF.
   1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: burst suppressed on pentobarb x24
   hrs on [**4-27**], now tapering pentobarb.  Also continues on Keppra and
   Dilantin.
   - continue weaning pento barbitol per neuro recommendations
    .
   2. Resp Failure: weakness of unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] (had planned for sural nerve
   bx- but currently on hold while addressing status epilepticus), failed
   PSV several days ago.  Worsening oxygenation likely [**1-19**] vol
   overload/effusions, VAP, and ?aspiration this am.  Abx as below.  No
   diuresis while getting pressors.
   - continue current ventilator settings
   6. ARF (virtually anuric): likely intrvasc vol depleted depsite total
   body vol overloaded (hypoalbuminemic)/ATN/infection.  Check FeBUN,
   urine eos, renal U/S.  PIPs not elevated to suggest intrabdominal
   hypertension
 but check bladder pressure.
   - depending on goals of care if patient continues to become
   hyperkalemic and acidotic would need consideration to be placed on CVVH
   for volume and acid control.
   - check q8h blood gases
   3. Hypotension: [**1-19**] AEDs + infection (fever and WBC bump this am).
   Titrate levophed to MAP >60.  Has not responded to IVF boluses.  Pan
   cx
d, empiric abx as below.  Needs CVL for better assessment of
   intrvascular volume status and hemodynamics.
   - Levophed, increasing requirement to maintain MAP>60
   4. Leukocystosis/fevers: likely [**1-19**] pseudomonal VAP and UTI.  Cont
   cipro and cefepime.  f/u cxs.
   5. Constipation: Manual disimpaction showed no evidence of stool in
   rectal vault. Patient 2 liter into GoLytely prep, will add miralax to
   regimen.
   7. Family discussions: sons have been updated, social work following.
   Plan for family meeting today w/neurology as well to discuss

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, who was admitted after experiencing tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient suffered from non-convulsive status epilepticus and underwent induction of pentobarb coma. Currently, the patient is on weaning pentobarbital per neuro recommendations and continues on Keppra and Dilantin.

The patient also has respiratory failure, weakness of unclear origin, and failed positive pressure ventilation (PSV) several days ago. There is worsening oxygenation likely due to volume overload/effusions, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and possible aspiration this morning. Antibiotics have been started as below. The current ventilator settings will be continued.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure (ARF), likely intravascular volume depleted despite total body volume overloaded (hypoalbuminemic)/acute tubular necrosis (ATN)/infection. Further evaluation of the renal status is needed, including checking the FeBUN, urine eos, and renal ultrasound. Considering the goals of care, if the patient continues to become hyperkalemic and acidotic, consideration should be given to placing the patient on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for volume and acid control.

The patient also has hypotension, likely related to sepsis and infection. Levophed has been started to maintain mean arterial"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, on mechanical ventilation (vent), who presented with seizures and recent neurological decline. She was admitted after tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient was found to be in non-convulsive status epilepticus and underwent induction of pentobarb coma, which is currently being tapered off. She continues on Keppra and Dilantin, with plans to change EEG leads due to significant artifact. 

The patient's respiratory failure has worsened, likely due to volume overload/effusions, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and possible aspiration this morning. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. Despite receiving pressors, there has been no diuresis, suggesting intravascular volume depletion.

The patient also exhibits acute kidney injury (ARF), likely due to intravascular volume depletion, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), infection, or possibly another cause. Renal consultation has been requested to start hemodialysis (HD). 

Additionally, the patient has experienced hypotension, which may be secondary to infection (fever and white blood cell bump this morning) or sepsis. Levophed has been titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, but the patient has not responded to intravenous fluid (IVF) boluses. A central venous line (CVL) has been"

   bolus, but it is likely that she has anuric renal failure from ATN.  I
   put in an order to remove her PICC line.
   -She is ordered for a renal ultrasound, urine lytes, and eosinophils to
   complete the full work-up
   -There was a question of a non-reactive pupil from nursing, we ordered
   a head CT which showed nothing acute
   -Pentobarbital has been weaned to 1 successfully!
   -No BM for several days, abdomen is becoming distended and firm.  She

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted after experiencing tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia.
- She suffered a cardiac arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging and had an improvement in respiratory status.
- The patient's mental status initially improved but then worsened, and an EEG revealed non-convulsive status epilepticus, which has been refractory and required the initiation of pentobarb coma.
- She is currently on a reduced dose of pentobarbital and continues on Keppra and Dilantin. The EEG leads need to be changed due to significant artifact.
- The patient's respiratory failure is due to weakness of unclear origin and failure of non-invasive ventilation (PSV). There is worsening oxygenation likely caused by volume overload/effusions, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and possible aspiration.
- She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infection.
- The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with minimal urine output, which is non-responsive to fluid boluses. This could be due to intravascular volume depletion despite total body volume overload, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or infection. Further tests, including FeBUN, urine eos, renal ultrasound, and hemodialysis (HD), are planned.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, suspected post-polio syndrome or chest wall restriction. She presented with nonconvulsive status epilepticus and was found to be in burst-suppressed status after induction of pentobarb coma. The patient's course has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with hypotension requiring pressors, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2 C (99°F)
- Heart rate: 66 bpm
- Blood pressure: 104/72 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on ventilator
- Central venous pressure: 18 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 22.8 K/uL
- Platelet count: 268 K/uL
- Blood urea nitrogen: 32.8 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support (possibly due to post-polio syndrome or chest wall restriction). She presented with tube feed aspiration, witnessed seizure, altered mental status, and hypoxemia. The patient was diagnosed with non-convulsive status epilepticus and subsequently induced into a pentobarb coma. 

Since admission, the patient has experienced several medical complications. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient remains on pressors with increasing levophed requirements, indicating persistent hypotension that requires ongoing support.

2. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient has had less than 200 cc of urine output over the past 24 hours without fluid responsiveness. This suggests acute kidney injury or anuric renal failure.

3. Invasive Ventilation: The patient required invasive ventilation support, which was stopped at one point but then restarted.

4. Multi-lumen line: The patient had a multi-lumen line inserted for further management.

5. PICC line: The patient initially had a PICC line placed, but it was stopped due to lack of functionality in one lumen.

6. Right Internal Jugular (RIJ) line: A RIJ line was placed last night, and the central venous pressure (CVP) reading was 13 on a peep of 10. The PICC line was planned to be discontinued.

7. Vomiting: The"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, chest wall restriction, and recent neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient was found to be in non-convulsive status epilepticus and was finally burst suppressed after the induction of pentobarb coma. She has since developed hypotension, requiring pressors and acute renal failure (anuric).

The patient has been experiencing multiple complications, including recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and anuric acute renal failure (ARF). Other assessments include weakness of unclear origin, failed non-invasive ventilation (NIV), multiple reasons for oxygenation and peep requirements (likely volume overload/effusions, VAP, and aspiration), leukocytosis/fevers, vomiting, and constipation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and platelet count (Plt). Blood cultures are negative for bacteria. Imaging studies reveal a chest x-ray showing volume overload, bilateral layering effusion in the trachea, and right internal jugular (IJ) vein placement. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment. The medical team is considering a transfer to another hospital due to the complexity of her case, which involves neurology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, and chest wall restriction. She was admitted after experiencing tube feed aspiration and a witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient is currently in non-convulsive status epilepticus and has been induced into a pentobarb coma. She has developed multiple complications including hypotension, requiring pressors, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory failure (ARF), and leukocytosis/fevers. The patient also has abdominal distention and constipation, and her prognosis is poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is currently experiencing non-convulsive status epilepticus and requires ongoing monitoring and management.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she requires pressors to maintain adequate blood flow.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients. Antibiotics have been started to treat the infection.
4. Acute respiratory failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to fluid overload, effusions, VAP, and possible aspiration.
5. Leukocystosis/fevers: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, suggesting an ongoing infection. Antibiotics are being administered to treat the infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo F w/chronic resp failure on vent (?NM (post polio syndrome) vs.
   chest wall restriction), sz d/o, and recent neurologic decline of
   unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed ?sz
   w/altered mental status and hypoxemia.  Found to be in non-convulsive
   status epilepticus.  Notably, on day PTA, suffered PEA arrest in
   setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging.  Resp status improved somewhat
   (tol PS not TC).  MS initially improved but then worse- EEG on [**4-19**]
   revealed non-convulsive status, which has been refractory, requiring
   initiation of a pentobarb comaNow finally burst suppressed after
   induction of pentobarb coma.  Course further c/b hypotension, requiring
   pressors, ARF, and anisarca with increasing ventilatory demands.
   .
   1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: burst suppressed on pentobarb x24
   hrs on [**4-27**], now tapering pentobarb.  Also continues on Keppra and
   Dilantin.
   - continue weaning pento barbitol per neuro recommendations
    .
   2. Resp Failure: weakness of unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] (had planned for sural nerve
   bx- but currently on hold while addressing status epilepticus), failed
   PSV several days ago.  Worsening oxygenation likely [**1-19**] vol
   overload/effusions, VAP.  Abx as below.  No diuresis while getting
   pressors.
   - continue current ventilator settings
   .
   3. ARF (virtually anuric): likely intrvasc vol depleted depsite total
   body vol overloaded (hypoalbuminemic)/ATN/infection.  Check FeBUN,
   urine eos, renal U/S.  PIPs not elevated to suggest intrabdominal
   hypertension
 but check bladder pressure.
   - CVP's [**7-28**] overnight.
   - depending on goals of care if patient continues to become
   hyperkalemic and acidotic would need consideration to be placed on CVVH
   for volume and acid control.
   - check q8h blood gases
   - Urine lytes yesterday -> FeNa < 1% suggesting pre-renal, Urine Eo's
   negative.
   .
   4. Hypotension: [**1-19**] AEDs + infection (fever and WBC bump this am).
   Titrate levophed to MAP >60.  Has not responded to IVF boluses.  Pan
   cx
d, on cefepime/cipro for pneumonia
   - Levophed, increasing requirement to maintain MAP>60
   .
   5. Leukocystosis/fevers: likely [**1-19**] pseudomonal VAP and UTI.  Cont
   cipro and cefepime.  f/u cxs.
   .
   6. Constipation: Manual disimpaction showed no evidence of stool in
   rectal vault. Patient taking Go Lytely and miralax.  ? BM this AM.
   .
   7. Family discussions: sons have been updated, social work following.
   Plan for family meeting today w/neurology as well to discuss

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

1. The patient is experiencing status epilepticus, which has been refractory and required the initiation of a pentobarb coma. The EEG revealed non-convulsive status epilepticus and is now burst suppressed after induction of pentobarb coma. The patient is being weaned off pentobarbital.

2. The patient has respiratory failure, which includes chronic respiratory failure on vent (possibly due to post-polio syndrome or chest wall restriction), recent neurological decline, tube feed aspiration, witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient's respiratory status improved after intubation, but there are ongoing ventilatory demands.

3. The patient is suffering from acute renal failure (ARF), which is likely intravascular volume depleted despite total body volume overload (hypoalbuminemic)/ATN/infection. The patient's kidneys measure 12.6 cm on the right side and 10.9 cm on the left side, with no hydronephrosis, mass, or stone. There is also a small amount of ascites noted.

4. The patient has hypotension that has not responded to intravenous fluid boluses. The patient requires titration of levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60.

5. The patient exhibits leukocystosis/fevers, likely due to pseudomonal ventilator-associated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, possible post-polio syndrome or chest wall restriction, seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline of unclear etiology. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient is currently in non-convulsive status epilepticus, now burst suppressed after induction of pentobarb coma.

The patient's course has been complicated by multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MOSF) with hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). The prognosis remains poor with MOSF.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is still on Keppra and Dilantin, but the prognosis for CNS recovery remains very poor.
2. Respiratory failure/pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has respiratory muscle weakness, making weaning off the ventilator challenging. There are multiple reasons for oxygenation and PEEP requirements, including volume overload/effusions, VAP, and recurrent aspiration.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires titration of levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. This indicates possible septic shock or infection contributing to the hypotension.
4. Acute renal failure (anuric): The patient likely has intravascular volume depletion despite"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, chest wall restriction, seizures, and a recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted after tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. She is now in non-convulsive status epilepticus, burst suppressed after induction of pentobarb coma. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute renal failure (ARF), leukocytosis/fevers, abdominal distention/constipation, and multiorgan system failure (MOSF) with poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is currently experiencing burst suppression on pentobarb, which may indicate a risk of further seizures or neurological deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure/pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has respiratory muscle weakness and failed pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to pseudomonal pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure, indicating potential cardiovascular instability and a risk of organ perfusion deficits.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is anuric, suggesting impaired kidney function. This could lead to further fluid imbalance, electrolyte disturbances, and increased risk of infections.
5. Leukocyt"

   initiation of a pentobarb comaNow finally burst suppressed after
   induction of pentobarb coma.  Course further c/b hypotension, requiring
   pressors, ARF, and anisarca with increasing ventilatory demands.
   .
   1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: burst suppressed on pentobarb x24
   hrs on [**4-27**], now tapering pentobarb.  Also continues on Keppra and
   Dilantin.
   - continue weaning pento barbitol per neuro recommendations
   -Continue dilantin and keppra
   -Neuro recs
    .
   2. Resp Failure: weakness of unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] (had planned for sural nerve
   bx- but currently on hold while addressing status epilepticus), failed
   PSV several days ago.  Worsening oxygenation likely [**1-19**] vol
   overload/effusions, VAP.  Abx as below.  No diuresis while getting
   pressors.  Currently ABG showing 7.28/42/58
   - continue current ventilator settings, could increase FiO2
   .
   3. ARF (virtually anuric): likely intrvasc vol depleted depsite total
   body vol overloaded (hypoalbuminemic)/ATN/infection.  Renal work-up
   negative including renal ultrasound, eosinophils, and Feurea reflects
   pre-renal failure.
   - depending on goals of care if patient continues to become
   hyperkalemic and acidotic would need consideration to be placed on CVVH
   for volume and acid control.
   -Keep CVPs at goal of 12
   .
   4. Hypotension: [**1-19**] AEDs + infection (fever and WBC bump this am).
   Titrate levophed to MAP >60.  Has not responded to IVF boluses.  Pan

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, chest wall restriction, seizures disorder, and recent neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient was found to be in non-convulsive status epilepticus and suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hypoxemia/mucous plugging. Her respiratory status improved somewhat, but her mental status initially improved and then worsened. An EEG on [**4-19**] revealed non-convulsive status, which has been refractory, requiring the initiation of a pentobarbital coma. The patient's condition has been further complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), anasarca, and increasing ventilatory demands.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient's non-convulsive status epilepticus has been burst suppressed on pentobarbital for 24 hours on [**4-27**], and they are now tapering pentobarbital. They continue on Keppra and Dilantin. It is important to continue weaning pentobarbital per neuro recommendations, continue Dilantin and Keppra, and follow neuro recommendations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 2473**] is a 76F w/chronic respiratory failure on a ventilator
   (?post polio syndrome vs. critical care myopathy vs chest wall
   restriction), seizure d/o, and recent neurologic decline of unclear
   etiology, and hypoxia.   Has had two pseudomonal VAP
s, was found to be
   in non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotensive, and now is in ARF.
   .
   #. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: burst suppressed on pentobarb x24
   hrs on [**4-27**], now tapering pentobarb.  Also continues on Keppra and
   Dilantin.
   - continue weaning pento barbitol per neuro recommendations
   -Continue dilantin and keppra
   -Neuro recs
    .
   #. Resp Failure: weakness of unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] (critical care myopathy vs.
   post-polio syndrome, vs. chest wall restriction), had planned for a
   sural nerve biopsy, which is currently on hold.  Also complicated by
   two pseudomonal VAPs and volume overload.
   -ABX for VAP, day [**3-28**]
   -unable to diurese while on pressors
   -no SBT during acute issue
   #. ARF (virtually anuric): likely intrvasc vol depleted depsite total
   body vol overloaded.  Of note the patient has been hypotensive and is
   hypoalbuminemic.  .  Renal work-up negative including renal ultrasound,
   eosinophils, and Feurea reflects pre-renal failure.
   - depending on goals of care if patient continues to become
   hyperkalemic and acidotic would need consideration to be placed on CVVH
   for volume and acid control.
   -Keep CVPs at goal of 12
   .
   #. Hypotension: [**1-19**] AEDs + infection (fever and WBC bump this am).
   Titrate levophed to MAP >60.  Has not responded to IVF boluses.  Pan
   cx
d, on cefepime/cipro for pneumonia
   - Levophed, increasing requirement to maintain MAP>60
   .
   5. Leukocystosis/fevers: likely [**1-19**] pseudomonal VAP and UTI.
   - Cont cipro and cefepime, for double coverage of pseudomonas, day [**3-28**]
   .
   .
   7. Family discussions: sons have been updated, social work following.
   Plan for family meeting today w/neurology as well to discuss
   prognosis.  Would also like to involve palliative care, but family not
   currently ready.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on a ventilator, seizure disorder, and recent neurological decline of unclear etiology. She has had two pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently in non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF), hypotension, and leukocytosis with fever. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is burst suppressed on pentobarbital and being tapered off. She will continue on Keppra and Dilantin.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's weakness is of unclear etiology (critical care myopathy vs. post-polio syndrome vs. chest wall restriction). She has had two pseudomonal VAPs and volume overload.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient is virtually anuric and likely intravascular volume depleted despite total body volume overloaded. Renal work-up is negative.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive and hypoalbuminemic. Levophed has been titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.
5. Leukocystosis/fevers: The patient likely has pseudomonal VAP and urinary tract infection (UTI).
6. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 40 mL/hour.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, chest wall restriction, seizures, and recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient is currently in a non-convulsive status epilepticus, burst suppressed with pentobarb coma, which is being tapered off per neuro recommendations. She remains on Keppra and Dilantin (follow level). Prognosis for CNS recovery remains very poor.

The patient's main issues include non-convulsive status epilepticus, respiratory failure, pseudomonal pneumonia, and weakness of unclear etiology (critical care neuropathy, post-polio, restriction from obesity/chest wall). She is holding on wean given unresponsiveness, pneumonia, and significant volume overload due to acute renal failure (ARF). Double coverage with cipro/cefepime for pseudomonal pneumonia is being continued. O2 weaning, ventilation settings adjustment, and volume removal/diuresis will be necessary if she stabilizes.

The patient also has hypotension, which is multifactorial and is slowly tapering off levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Further improvement in blood pressure is expected as pentobarb is tapered off. Antibiotics will be continued as above.

In terms of ARF, the patient likely has intravascular volume depletion despite total body volume"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 2473**] is a 76F with chronic respiratory failure of unknown
   etiology with vent dependence, history of a seizure disorder who
   presented with AMS and hypoxemia following an aspiration event.
   Hospital [**Last Name (un) 2736**] has been complicated by non-convulsive status
   epilepticus, recurrent pseudomonal pneumonias, hypotension, respiratory
   failure, and ARF.
   # Non-convulsive status epilepticus: Burst suppressed x24hrs on
   Saturday, pentobarb fully weaned off with no further seizure activity.
   -Per discussion with neuro, pentobarb may remain in the system for [**3-25**]
   days after stopping it.  We will continue to monitor her clinically for
   changes in mental status, although the likelihood of a meaningfull
   recovery is quite grim.
   -Continue keppra and dilantin, with daily dilantin levels due to her
   low albumin and nutrtion status
   -Follow up neuro recs.
   # Respiratory failure: unclear etiology, post-polio syndrome vs.
   critical care neuropathy vs. chest wall restriction.  PIP and Pplateau
   both equal at 24-25, but still under 30, suggesting a compliance
   problem, likely secondary to PNA and fluid overload.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms [**Known lastname 2473**] is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure of unknown etiology and vent dependence. She presented with altered mental status (AMS) and hypoxemia following an aspiration event. Her hospital course has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, recurrent pseudomonal pneumonias, hypotension, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ARF).

24-hour events include pentobarb being weaned off, levophed started at 0.04, and oxygen saturation (Sats) at 93% on 50% FiO2. No known drug allergies were reported.

Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/54 to 123/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has increased from 69 kg at admission to 73.5 kg currently.

Physical examination reveals a sluggish left pupil, normal heart sounds with regular rhythm, symmetric chest expansion, coarse ventilated breath sounds, distended abdomen, and warm skin without rash. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be unresponsive with non-purposeful movements.

Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 22.8 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.7 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 67 mg/dL, and creatinine (Cr) of 1.7 mg/dL. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Other lab values include elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated lactate acid, low albumin, and elevated liver enzymes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient's burst suppressed x24hrs on Saturday, and pentobarb was fully weaned off with no further seizure activity. Pentobarb may remain in the system for 3-25 days after stopping it. Monitor for changes in mental status.
2. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology, post-polio syndrome vs. critical care neuropathy vs. chest wall restriction. Monitor VBG's and adjust RR as needed to prevent acidemia.
3. Hypotension: Secondary to pentobarb, which will be in the system for one more week, and possibly to infection (VAP). Slowly tapering off levophed to MAP > 60, currently at 0.04.
4. Pseudomonal pneumonia: Ventilator-associated, second round during this hospitalization. Continue double coverage with cefepime/cipro, starting from day 4-27.
5. ARF: Likely related to pre-renal failure with a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitor clinically for autodi"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 2473**] is a 76F with chronic respiratory failure of unknown
   etiology with vent dependence, history of a seizure disorder who
   presented with AMS and hypoxemia following an aspiration event.
   Hospital [**Last Name (un) 2736**] has been complicated by non-convulsive status
   epilepticus, recurrent pseudomonal pneumonias, hypotension, respiratory
   failure, and ARF.
   # Non-convulsive status epilepticus: Burst suppressed x24hrs on
   Saturday, pentobarb weaned on [**5-1**].  Re-entered status on [**5-2**] and
   placed back on pentobarb
   -Continue pentobarb for now at 0.5, increasing 0.5 q6H until family
   discussion is held given poor prognosis.
   -Continue keppra and dilantin, with daily dilantin levels due to her
   low albumin and nutrtion status
   -Follow up neuro recs.
   # Respiratory failure: unclear etiology, post-polio syndrome vs.
   critical care neuropathy vs. chest wall restriction.  PIP and Pplateau
   both equal at 24-25, and under 30.  ABG shows improvement in pH and
   pCO2 with increased respiratory rate.
   -Sural nerve biopsy on hold during acute illness
   -Monitor VBG's and adjust RR as needed to prevent acidemia
   #. Hypotension: Secondary to pentobarb, which will be in system for one
   more week, and possibly to infection (VAP).  Weaned off of levophed.
   CVPs are normal, with intravascular depletion and ATN suggesting poor
   forward flow.  Levophed off.
   -Follow up micro and continue abx
   -consider albumin to help expand intravascular volume if she becomes
   hypotensive on pentobarb with lasix.
   # Pseudomonal PNA: ventilator associated, second round during this
   hospitalization
   -continue double coverage with cefepime/cipro, day [**4-27**]
   # ARF: Likely related to Pre-renal failure with a component of ATN.  Cr
   seems to have stabilized at 1.7, UOP still remains low.
   -Will monitor clinically for autodiuresis
   -No acute indication for CVVH at this time
   -Consider albumin in help expand intravascular fluid and help renal
   perfusion

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure of unknown etiology, vent dependence, and a history of seizure disorder. She presented with altered mental status (AMS) and hypoxemia following an aspiration event. Her hospital course has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, recurrent pseudomonal pneumonias, hypotension, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/54 mmHg to 123/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and unresponsive, with non-purposeful movements. Physical examination reveals coarse ventilated breath sounds, distended abdomen, and diminished peripheral pulses. Neurologic examination is limited due to sedation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of up to 22.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 0.8 to 1.7 mg/dL, and low albumin at 2.3 g/dL. The patient has received multiple interventions, including pentobarbital for non-convulsive status epilepticus, antibiotics for pseudomonal pneumonia, and renal dosing of medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, ICU myopathy, chest wall restriction, seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted after tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient is currently in non-convulsive status epilepticus, burst suppressed after induction of pentobarb coma, but recurrent after pentobarb was weaned off. She remains on Keppra and Dilantin with poor prognosis for CNS recovery.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, pseudomonal pneumonia, muscle weakness of unclear etiology (critical care neuropathy, post-polio, restriction from obesity/chest wall), hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, and myalgia. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient remains on Keppra and Dilantin with ongoing monitoring of drug levels.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's prognosis remains poor with ongoing respiratory muscle weakness. Weaning from the ventilator is challenging due to her unresponsiveness, pseudomonal pneumonia, and fluid overload.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, possibly due to AEDs, infection, and shock. Levophed has been discontinued with MAPS > 60.
4. ARF/metabolic acidosis:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, ICU myopathy, and chest wall restriction. The patient has experienced several medical complications during her stay in the ICU.

1. Status Epilepticus: The patient was admitted after tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. She developed non-convulsive status epilepticus, which was initially suppressed with pentobarb coma but has now recurred after the weaning off of pentobarb.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. She also has pseudomonal pneumonia and requires full vent support with increased RR to correct metabolic acidosis. The patient's obesity and chest wall restriction contribute to her respiratory muscle weakness.

3. Hypotension: The patient has multifactorial hypotension, including the effects of AEDs (anti-epileptic drugs) and infection/shock. The shock component seems to have resolved, and she is now off levophed with MAPS > 60. However, she may require pressor support once pentobarb is restarted.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has intravascular volume down despite total body volume overload, which may be due to hypoalbuminemia, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or infection. There is no indication for transfusion or colloid at this time"

   associated pneumonia
   # Non-convulsive status epilepticus: Did not tolerate pento-barb wean,
   re-entering non-convulsive status.  Neurology and ICU team met with
   family regarding poor prognosis, they are requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 1244**]
   neurology ICU.
   -Restarted pentobarb, and added depakote per neuro recs.  Continues on
   keppra and dilantin
   -F/u neuro recs, continuing EEG monitoring
   -Prognosis poor, however patient would like transfer to [**Hospital1 1244**] neuro ICU
   # Resp Failure: unclear etiology, work-up on hold secondary to current
   issues.   VGB's stable on Fio2 40%, 400x16, most recent ABG
   7.33/32/40.  PIP 24, plateau 24.  Also volume overloaded, however have
   been unable to diurese in the setting of hypotension
   -continue current vent settings
   -monitor VBGs, increasing RR to correct metabolic acidosis
   -Will need diuresis when feasible ie: pressure can tolerate
   # pseudomonal pna
   -cipro/cefepime, day [**5-28**]
    # Hypotension: CVPs normal, MAPS low, more consistent with
   cardiogenic/
   -echo and consider dobutamine for better renal perfusion
   -abx for PNA as above
   -Levophed to keep MAPs>60
   # ARF: with a gap acidosis likely from uremia.  Cr. bumped from 1.7-2
   Gap 17 today with continued decrease in bicarb.  Likely secondary to
   ATn in the setting o low perfusion pressure to the kidneys.  UOP
   minimal
   -On levophed, so a trial of lasix would not be appropriate, echo to
   assess need for dobuta
   -pH still stable, no acute indication for CVVH

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient did not tolerate the weaning of pentobarbital and re-entered non-convulsive status. This indicates ongoing seizure activity, which needs close monitoring and management.
2. Respiratory failure: The etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear, and the work-up is on hold due to current issues. The patient's ventilation parameters are stable on FiO2 40%, 400x16, with a recent ABG showing pH 7.33, PaCO2 32, and PaO2 40. However, the patient is volume overloaded, making it difficult to diurese in the setting of hypotension.
3. Pseudomonal VAP: The patient has recurrent pseudomonal VAP, and appropriate antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Cefepime) are being administered. Close monitoring for clinical improvement and microbiological response is essential.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is more consistent with cardiogenic causes, as indicated by normal central venous pressures (CVPs) and low mean arterial pressures (MAPs). An echoc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently intubated and sedated, unresponsive to verbal or painful stimuli. Her vital signs are stable, but she is volume overloaded and has a history of intravascular volume depletion. She has a tracheostomy tube in place and large bilateral pleural effusions associated with adjacent atelectasis. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows a tracheostomy tube in standard position, right internal jugular (IJ) tip in the lower superior vena cava (SVC), and large bilateral pleural effusions. She has been on multiple antibiotics for suspected infections, including Cefepime and Ciprofloxacin. The patient's prognosis is poor, and the family is requesting transfer to another hospital's neurology ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is experiencing ongoing seizures, which can lead to further neurological complications if not properly managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor perfusion and organ dysfunction, increasing the risk of further organ damage.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, ICU myopathy, and chest wall restriction. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient has experienced non-convulsive status epilepticus, burst suppressed after induction of pentobarb coma, and recurrent episodes after weaning off pentobarbital and mechanical oxygen supplementation with hypotension requiring pressors. She also has recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory failure (ARF). Prognosis remains extremely poor, and ongoing discussions with the family regarding goals of care are ongoing, with involvement from the ethics service.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient has had recurrent episodes of non-convulsive status epilepticus despite being on pentobarb coma and mechanical ventilation. This indicates ongoing neurological decline and potential complications related to brain function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and recent ARF suggest a compromised respiratory system. This could lead to further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
3. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, which is a type of lung infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. This infection could worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of VAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, ICU myopathy, and chest wall restriction. She has a history of seizures and has been admitted after tube feed aspiration and a witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient experienced non-convulsive status epilepticus, which was initially controlled with pentobarb coma but then recurred after weaning off the medication. She requires pressors for hypotension and has recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient has already experienced episodes of non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is a serious condition that requires continuous monitoring and management.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying conditions such as post-polio syndrome, ICU myopathy, and chest wall restriction. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications.
3. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has a pseudomonal pneumonia infection, which requires appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent worsening of the condition.
4. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors for hypotension, indicating a possible cardiac component contributing to her low blood pressure. Further evaluation of the cardiovascular system is necessary.
5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing ARF, possibly due to factors such as low perfusion, medication"

   Addendum:
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2766**] called back and stated that after discussion with the
   neurology fellow they believe that it would be in the best interest of
   the patient if she was transferred on Monday because they would not be
   able to hook her upto continuous EEG monitoring over the weekend.  She
   advised to page the neurology oncall consult resident by calling
   [**0-0-**], pager no. [**Serial Number 2767**] on Monday to facilitate the transfer.
","Summary:
The patient, [**Known lastname 2473**], is currently in the ICU and being treated for various medical conditions. She is on pentobarb, dilantin, depakote, and keppra for epilepsy. The patient also had a fever last week and has been restarted on antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia. She has been intermittently hypotensive, especially with the infusion of pentobarb, and required levophed. The patient's renal function has worsened, with creatinine levels up to 2.0, and she has been oliguric. Renal consultation recommended a lasix drip to see if urine output improves. There is a plan to transfer the patient to another facility on Monday as continuous EEG monitoring cannot be done over the weekend.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing or worsening pneumonia due to being on mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's intermittent hypotension, especially with the infusion of pentobarb, may lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential complications.
3. Worsening renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria indicate deteriorating renal function, which can lead to further complications such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Drug interactions: The combination of medications like pentobarbital, dilantin, depakote, and keppra can potentially interact with each other, leading to adverse effects or reduced efficacy of certain drugs.
5. Seizure control: Despite the use of multiple antiepileptic medications, the patient may continue to experience seizures, which can increase the risk of injury or further complications.
6. Transfer and continuity of care: The transfer of the patient to another facility may disrupt the continuity of care and increase the risk of medical errors during the transition."

","Summary of the progress note:
- Patient on pentobarb, dilantin, depakote, and keppra for epilepsy.
- Fever last week, restarted on antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
- Intermittent hypotension, especially with pentobarb infusion, required levophed.
- Worsening renal failure, creatinine up to 2.0, oliguric.
- Renal consulted, recommended lasix drip to improve urine output.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been restarted on antibiotics due to a fever last week. VAP is a potential complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period of time. It is caused by bacteria that normally reside in the upper airways or gut, which can infect the lungs when the immune system is compromised.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypotension, particularly during the infusion of pentobarb. This could be a sign of cardiovascular instability or an adverse reaction to the medication. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage this complication.

3. Worsening renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen to 2.0, indicating a decline in kidney function. Oliguria (decreased urine output) is also mentioned, which further suggests renal impairment. The use of a lasix drip is recommended to increase urine output and potentially improve renal function.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. The patient did not tolerate weaning from pentobarbital and re-entered non-convulsive status epilepticus. Neurology and ICU team met with the family regarding poor prognosis and discussed transfer to another hospital's neurology ICU.

3. The patient is currently on pentobarbital and depakote per neuro recommendations. EEG monitoring will continue, and phenytoin and valproic acid levels will be followed up.

4. Respiratory failure etiology is unclear, and the patient has pneumonia with volume overload. Work-up for the cause of respiratory failure is on hold due to current issues. The patient's VBGs are stable on FiO2 40%, 400x16, with most recent ABG showing pH 7.33/32/40. PIP and plateau pressures are 24, respectively.

5. The patient is also volume overloaded but has been unable to diurese in the setting of hypotension. Current vent settings will be continued, and VBGs will be monitored. Increasing RR will be done to correct metabolic acidosis. Diuresis will be considered when feasible"

   # Non-convulsive status epilepticus: Did not tolerate pento-barb wean,
   re-entering non-convulsive status.  Neurology and ICU team met with
   family regarding poor prognosis, they are requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 1244**]
   neurology ICU.
   -Restarted pentobarb, and added depakote per neuro recs.  Continues on
   keppra and dilantin
   -F/u neuro recs, continuing EEG monitoring
   -Prognosis poor, however patient would like transfer to [**Hospital1 1244**] neuro ICU
   - f/u phenytoin and valproic acid levels -> d/w neurology.
   .
   # Resp Failure: unclear etiology, Pna w. volume overload, work-up on
   hold secondary to current issues.   VGB's stable on Fio2 40%, 400x16,
   most recent ABG 7.33/32/40.  PIP 24, plateau 24.  Also volume
   overloaded, however have been unable to diurese in the setting of
   hypotension
   -continue current vent settings
   -monitor VBGs, increasing RR to correct metabolic acidosis.
   -Will need diuresis when feasible ie: pressure can tolerate.
   - ?PE given RV pressure volume overload.  LENI's negative.

    # Hypotension: CVPs normal, MAPS low, more consistent with
   cardiogenic/
   -TTE: With blown RV on TTE suggesting possible PE.  No e/o LV systolic
   dysfunciton to support cardiogenic shock and mixed venous O2 sat's >70%
   c/w sepsis.  Will continue with levophed at this time given its beta-1
   activity in addition to peripheral alpha. -> d/w cardiology regarding
   echo results ? PE vs. volume overload.
   -abx for PNA as above
   -Levophed to keep MAPs>60
   - Replete ionized calcium.

   # ARF: with a gap acidosis likely from uremia.  Cr. bumped from 2 ->
   2.2 Gap 20 w/o correcting for alblumin today with continued decrease in
   bicarb.  Likely secondary to ATn in the setting o low perfusion
   pressure to the kidneys.  UOP minimal

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 108/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O.

The patient has a history of ARF, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and a decrease in bicarbonate. The urine output is minimal, suggesting renal dysfunction. The patient is also experiencing hyponatremia, likely due to hypervolemic causes. 

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with non-convulsive status epilepticus that has not tolerated weaning from pentobarbital. The patient is on multiple antiepileptic drugs, including keppra, dilantin, and valproic acid. 

The patient's chest X-ray shows moderate cardiomegaly, bibasal consolidation, and moderate-to-large pleural effusion. The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction, and the tracheostomy is at the mid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, ICU myopathy, chest wall restriction, and recent progressive neurologic decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient has been experiencing non-convulsive status epilepticus, burst suppressed after induction of pentobarb coma, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). Her prognosis remains extremely poor, and ongoing discussions with the family regarding goals of care are taking place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of non-convulsive status epilepticus despite being on pentobarbital coma. It is important to closely monitor her neurologic status and adjust the antiepileptic medication as per the neurology team's input.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has recurrent VAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. Proper adherence to VAP prevention strategies, such as elevating the head of bed, performing daily sedation assessments, and implementing oral hygiene protocols, should be continued.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is showing signs of ARF, indicated by increasing creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Monitoring fluid balance, electrolytes, and acid-base status is crucial. Diuretics, such as las"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is a serious neurological condition. This requires ongoing management with antiepileptic drugs and close monitoring by the neurology team.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation. The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent further respiratory complications.

3. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, which is a type of lung infection caused by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. This infection requires specific antibiotic therapy, and the patient's response to treatment should be closely monitored.

4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to multiple factors such as sepsis, infection, shock, or cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and appropriate management, including the use of vasopressors, is essential.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is showing signs of progressive renal failure, as indicated by increasing levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. This condition requires further evaluation by the renal team and appropriate management to prevent further deterioration"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications including pentobarbital, norepinephrine, heparin, furosemide (Lasix), and others. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/53 to 127/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, and her urine output is minimal. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and altered electrolyte levels. Imaging and microbiology tests are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is experiencing recurrent seizures, and her condition is not improving despite treatment with pentobarbital. She requires close monitoring and adjustment of antiepileptic medications.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and her current respiratory support is being managed with mechanical ventilation. However, she continues to have volume overload, making diuresis challenging due to hypot"

   24 Hour Events:
   Echo showed severe RV heart strain, which we reviewed with cards and
   they are calling [**Last Name (un) 2790**] sign (high suspicion for PE) so we started

   -Disimpacted and gave a soap suds enema.  Also go lytely from above.
   -Renal came be and made some recs: add diuril to lasix gtt as she is
   only putting out minimally to a gtt at 25mg/hr; obtain a serum
   osmolality/daily lactates to help characterize her gap acidosis; give
   1L of D5W with three amps of bicarb to help worsening acidosis; give

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, status post polio syndrome, ICU myopathy, chest wall restriction, seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline. The patient was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with non-convulsive status epilepticus, burst suppressed after induction of pentobarb coma and recurrent after pentobarb weaned off. She also has hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and progressive renal failure with anasarca.

The patient's prognosis remains extremely poor, and ongoing discussions with the family regarding goals of care are being conducted. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient has ongoing seizures that are not convulsive in nature. These seizures can continue to recur and pose a risk to the patient's neurological recovery.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires the use of pressors to maintain adequate perfusion. If the hypotension persists or worsens, it could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

3. Recurrent VAP: The patient has had multiple episodes of VAP, which is an infection acquired during mechanical ventilation. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications and can worsen her underlying respiratory failure.

4. Progressive renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, ICU myopathy, and chest wall restriction. She has experienced tube feed aspiration, witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia, non-convulsive status epilepticus, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and progressive renal failure with anasarca. The prognosis remains extremely poor, and ongoing discussions with the family regarding goals of care are being held.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is currently in a pentobarb coma and will continue to be monitored for any recurrence of seizures. Medications such as depakote, Keppra, and Dilantin will be continued, and their levels will be followed.
2. Presumed pulmonary embolism (PE): Heparin has been started due to the suspected PE. An echocardiogram showed RV apical sparing, which may indicate the presence of a PE.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has pseudomonal pneumonia and continues to receive ciprofloxacin and cefepime. ACV with 40% peep at 10 will be continued. 
4. Hypotension: The cause of hypotension is multifactorial, including AEDs, infection, and shock. Heparin will be continued, and further evaluation of the cardiac data will be done. Diuretics and albumin may help"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who is ventilator-dependent due to critical illness neuropathy since admission. She was admitted from a rehabilitation center after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Her course has been complicated by nonconvulsive status epilepticus, which she is being treated with valproate, pentobarbital, Keppra, and dilantin. She also has hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute respiratory failure (ARF). The patient is currently on Lasix gtt for renal support and heparin gtt for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). The family is not satisfied with the care provided and is requesting a transfer to another hospital.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: The patient continues to experience episodes of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, as indicated by her inability to tolerate weaning off pentobarbital. This requires ongoing monitoring and management with antiepileptic drugs.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low mean arterial pressure (MAP) suggests ongoing hypotension, which may be due to cardiogenic shock or sepsis. This needs to be addressed promptly to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
3. Recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has had multiple episodes of VAP, likely due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation. Appropriate measures such as elevating the head"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU due to critical illness neuropathy since February 16th, 2015. She was admitted from rehab following a PEA arrest. Her course has been complicated by nonconvulsive status epilepticus, which she is currently being treated for with valproate, pentobarbital, Keppra, and dilantin. She is also experiencing hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory failure (ARF), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's family is not satisfied with her care and has requested a transfer to Hospital1.

Medical Complications:
1. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: The patient did not tolerate weaning off pentobarbital and re-entered nonconvulsive status. Neurology and ICU teams met with the family regarding the poor prognosis.
2. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology, with volume overload, presumed PE, and neurological decompensation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and settings will be continued. VBGs will be monitored, increasing RR to correct metabolic acidosis. Diuretics (Lasix gtt, Diuril, and albumin) will be used to manage fluid balance.
3. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient is on ciprofloxacin and cefepime for the second course of treatment.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, ICU myopathy, chest wall restriction, seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurologic decline. The patient was admitted after experiencing tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia.

The patient's course in the ICU has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, burst-suppressed after induction of pentobarb coma and recurrent after pentobarb weaned off. The patient also required mechanical oxygenation support with hypotension, necessitating the use of pressors. Additionally, the patient developed recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and progressive renal failure with anasarca.

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 73-76 bpm, blood pressure of 90/42-54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus rhythm. The patient is unresponsive and has decreased muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within normal ranges. Other lab values, including liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits or show mild abnormalities.

Imaging studies reveal tracheal tube placement, right internal jugular vein catheterization, and layering effusions. There are no signs of obstruction in"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is currently experiencing non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is being managed with pentobarbital coma and depakote. The goal is to maintain the patient's seizure level below 80-100. There is ongoing discussion regarding the wean of pentobarbital once the depakote level reaches goal.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is evidence of recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and progressive acute respiratory failure with anasarca. The patient is also presumed to have pulmonary embolism (PE). CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) may be considered for volume removal and clearance, although its role as a bridge to recovery is uncertain given the poor prognosis.

3. Hypotension: The patient has multifactorial hypotension, including the effects of AEDs (anti-epileptic drugs) and infection/shock. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is at 30, and there is no indication for transfusion. Diuresis with lasix gtt and albumin has been initiated, along with consideration for CVVH.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased slightly, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotensive, acute renal failure, and recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is experiencing ongoing seizures, and the neurology team is considering additional agents to control them. There is also a discussion about possible Hashimoto's encephalopathy or other obscure causes, with a potential brain biopsy being considered.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition is multifactorial, including volume overload, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), and neurological decompensation. Ventilator settings are being monitored, and diuretics have been adjusted.
3. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has an ongoing infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, despite previous treatment. Sputum cultures are still positive for this bacteria, and the ID team recommends sending sensitivity testing to guide antibiotic therapy.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to various factors such as medications, sepsis, or obstructive shock caused by a PE. Levophed is being used to maintain adequate blood pressure, and"

   24 Hour Events:
   - IR to place line for CVVH in AM.  Family agrees to be reachable in
   morning at home phone number.
   - Some bleeding from nose and from ET tube.  Restarted heparin gtt in
   PM given stable Hct. -> then re-bleeding around 12AM from around trach
   and mouth, secretions from ET tube not particularly bloody.  Held
   heparin gtt.  Checked labs at 2AM and repeat Hct stable.
   - Renal: Okay with CVVH.  Change to Bumex from lasix, change diuril
   dose.
   - ID: Do not treat urine as will complicate seizure disorder more than
   will benefit clinical course, recommend regular change of foley.
   - Neuro: Decrease pentobarb gtt q6 hr overnight.  Neuro -> ? Brain

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient has been experiencing ongoing bleeding, including from the tracheostomy site and oropharynx, despite being on heparin. This has led to the decision to hold the heparin gtt and plan for the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) via internal jugular vein (IR) for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). 

The patient's respiratory status is stable with current ventilator settings, but there is a concern for volume overload. There are also signs of overhydration and massive bilateral pleural effusions on the chest X-ray. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated at 19.0 K/uL, indicating a possible infection. 

The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels and acidosis. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been planned to manage the renal failure. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, and sensitivity testing for antibiotics is pending. 

There are concerns about the patient's neurological status, including non-convulsive status epilepticus and possible Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Brain biopsy may be considered if other causes are"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo F w/chronic resp failure on vent, known sz d/o, and recent
   progressive neurologic decline of unclear [**Name2 (NI) 2663**] admitted following
   tube feed aspiration and witnessed sz w/ altered mental status and
   hypoxemia.
        Course has been c/b:
   non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, requiring pressors,
   recurrent VAP and progressive ARF w/ anasarca, presumed PE, ileus
        Continues to decline with [**Name2 (NI) 2816**], remais unresponsive in pentobarb
   coma to suppress sz activity
   Prognosis poor. Ongoing family discussions regarding goals of care.
   Active issues remain:

   depakote not yet therapeutic

   and Dilantin (follow level--at goal 20, dose decreased yesterday)

   Given extremely poor prognosis CVVH does not appear as bridge to
   recovery.  However, along w/ ongoing discussion with family and neuro
   team, reasonable to consider CVVH pending further neuro recs and
   transition off pentobarb, as now MS will be further complicated by
   uremia as well.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, known seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia.

The patient's course has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute respiratory failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), and ileus. She remains unresponsive in pentobarb coma to suppress seizure activity.

Prognosis is poor, and ongoing family discussions regarding goals of care are being held. Active issues include non-convulsive status epilepticus, ARF/gap metabolic acidosis/volume overload, presumed PE, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient's unresponsiveness in pentobarb coma indicates ongoing seizure activity, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain blood pressure, suggesting possible poor perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Recurrent VAP: The presence of pseudomonas in sputum indicates a possible multi-drug resistant infection. The patient may require a change in antibiotic therapy and additional measures to clear the infection.
4. Progressive ARF: The patient's kidney function is deteriorating, as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, post-polio syndrome, ICU myopathy, and chest wall restriction. She was admitted after experiencing tube feed aspiration and a witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. Since admission, she has shown a decline in health with multiple problems including non-convulsive status epilepticus, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute respiratory failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), and ileus.

Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient remains in a pentobarbital coma due to ongoing seizures. Her antiepileptic drug levels are being monitored, and adjustments are being made to achieve therapeutic levels.
2. ARF/Gap metabolic acidosis/volume overload: The patient has shown poor response to attempts at diuresis and is experiencing difficulty with fluid removal. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is planned for volume removal and clearance after an interventional radiology (IR) line placement.
3. Presumed PE: Heparin gtt has been held due to bleeding at the mouth and for the line, but will resume with a lower goal, keeping T and cross and following the patient's condition.
4. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient continues to grow pseudomonas in her sputum despite two courses of antibiotics. Sensitivities"

   Patient had heparin gtt stopped for IR guided line placements. Was not
   restarted yesterday due to increased bloody secretions from mouth and
   PEG tube.
   CVVH was started around 8PM and stopped at MIDNIGHT due to hypothermia
   and bradycardia. This was thought to be [**1-19**] to CVVH which was held,
   dopamine was added to increase HR, pt. was not hypotensive, bair hugger
   was placed with good effect. Lactate was increased to 4.4 and there was
   concern for bowel perf vs ischemic gut and abx were broadened to
   vanco/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/cipro/caspo, bladder P 16. CVVH was restarted at
   430am and she is just now reaching net negative hourly rate. Discussion
   with sons, they still want full code but may be starting to think about
   changing code status. 2nd opinion from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33**] to assess for
   futility of tx to be done today.
   Optho- no signs fungal infiltrates
   ID consult
   Pseudomonas is developing resistance with accumilated
   antimicrobial exposure, though it is not entirely clear that the
   persistent isolation of Pseudomonas might not represent
   colonization of her tracheostomy
   1. Please send blood cultures
   2. Please send differential
   3. Might consider sampling of pleural effusions to evaluate for
   parapneumonic effusion requiring drainage if invasive procedures
   are considered.
   4. Would consider BAL for isolated specimen.
   5. Would discontinue Cefepime, would start meropenem dosed for
   renal clearance on CVVH if that is to be initiated tonight,
   dosing would be 500 mg IV Q 12 hours.
   6. Would hold on antifungal therapy for now, should she develop
   candidemia would start antifungal therapy.
   7. Would find out if additional CSF is available for analysis for
   14-3-3 protien as marker of possible variant CJD.
   8. Might consider ENT evaluation given bleeding in oropharnx and
   from around tracheostomy as this might be an additional source
   driving infection.
   9. Would send C diff toxin assay if stools

   .
   # Non-convulsive status epilepticus: Did not tolerate pento-barb wean,
   re-entering non-convulsive status.  Neurology and ICU team met with
   family regarding poor prognosis, they are requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 1244**]
   neurology ICU.  At this time, attempting to optimize control of
   seizures with additional agents.
   .
   - pentobarb wean -> will hold and d/w neurology regarding further
   decreases, depakote, keppra and dilantin - adjust PRN as per neurology
   - Neurology considering possible hashimotos encephalopathy or other
   more obscure causes at this time - could consider proceeding to brain
   biopsy.  Have checked Anti-TPO, Anti-thyroglobulin studies
   -F/u neuro recs, continuing EEG monitoring -> weaning pentobarb by 0.25
   q6H as tolerated.
   - f/u phenytoin and valproic acid levels daily with goal 20 and 80-100
   respectively
   - ?Transfer to [**Hospital1 1244**] at family's request - on waiting list for a bed.
   .
   # Resp Failure: Multifactorial, Pna w. volume overload, presumed PE,
   neurological decompensation
   -continue current vent settings
   -monitor VBGs
   -did not diurese with lasix gtt so transitioned to diuril/bumex.  Plan
   for CVVH today after line placement.
   - treating empirically for PE given TTE results -> hold heparin gtt
   this AM, but restart this PM
 d/w renal.
   .
   # Pseudomonal pna : Sputum still growing sparse pseudomonas.  Likely
   has region of consolidation that is not clearing rather than
   reinfection. possibly colonization but difficult to tell given
   leukocytosis, and limited CXR.
   -cipro/cefepime, day [**9-27**] of second course
   -  Would resend sputum - ?treat until sputum clears vs. hold
   antibiotics.
   - ID consult today.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: New today to 19.  Has known Pseudomonal pneumonia but
   with continued growth on sputum.  Will ask lab to perform
   sensitivities, may need to resend sputum.  Urine with yeast which given
   multiple cultures may be a pathogen, but have d/w ID and at this time
   would not treat given potential interaction with anti-convulsant
   medications.  Will send Stool C. Diff, and repeat Blood cultures given
   line.  Change R-IJ for PICC line today in IR.
   - BCx, Sputum, Fungal studies.
   .
   # Yeast UTI: ID recommending not treating as will complicate
   neurological picture.
   - consider diflucan for 5 day course if decompensating clinically, but
   given probably interaction with seizure disorder would defer at this
   time.
   .
   # Hypotension: CVPs normal, MAP at goal, multifactorial
 [**1-19**] to meds,
   ?component of sepsis, and obstructive shock [**1-19**] PE.
   -TTE: With blown RV on TTE suggesting possible PE.  No e/o LV systolic
   dysfunciton to support cardiogenic shock and mixed venous O2 sat's >70%
   c/w sepsis.  Will continue with levophed at this time given its beta-1
   activity in addition to peripheral alpha. -> d/w cardiology regarding
   echo results and started on heparin gtt empirically
   -abx for PNA as above consider d/c today
   -Levophed to keep MAPs>60. sbp>100
   - Replete ionized calcium.
   - heparin gtt on hold for PE
   .
   # ARF: with a gap acidosis likely from uremia.  Cr. Continues to rise,

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications.

1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient did not tolerate the weaning of pentobarbital and re-entered a non-convulsive status. Neurology and ICU teams discussed the poor prognosis with the family, who requested transfer to another hospital's neurology ICU. The current plan is to optimize seizure control with additional agents.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including volume overload, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), and neurological decompensation. Current ventilator settings will be continued, and the patient will be monitored for VBGs. Diuretics have been adjusted, and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) is planned for today after line placement. Heparin gtt was temporarily held due to bleeding but will be restarted this evening.

3. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture still shows sparse growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There is a concern for consolidation that is not clearing rather than reinfection. The plan is to continue treatment with ciprofloxacin and cefepime, which"

   Patient had heparin gtt stopped for IR guided line placements. Was not
   restarted yesterday due to increased bloody secretions from mouth and
   PEG tube.
   CVVH was started around 8PM and stopped at MIDNIGHT due to hypothermia
   and bradycardia. This was thought to be [**1-19**] to CVVH which was held,
   dopamine was added to increase HR, pt. was not hypotensive, bair hugger
   was placed with good effect. Lactate was increased to 4.4 and there was
   concern for bowel perf vs ischemic gut and abx were broadened to
   vanco/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/cipro/caspo, bladder P 16. CVVH was restarted at
   430am and she is just now reaching net negative hourly rate. Discussion
   with sons, they still want full code but may be starting to think about
   changing code status. 2nd opinion from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33**] to assess for
   futility of tx to be done today.
   Optho- no signs fungal infiltrates
   ID consult
   Pseudomonas is developing resistance with accumilated
   antimicrobial exposure, though it is not entirely clear that the
   persistent isolation of Pseudomonas might not represent
   colonization of her tracheostomy
   1. Please send blood cultures
   2. Please send differential
   3. Might consider sampling of pleural effusions to evaluate for
   parapneumonic effusion requiring drainage if invasive procedures
   are considered.
   4. Would consider BAL for isolated specimen.
   5. Would discontinue Cefepime, would start meropenem dosed for
   renal clearance on CVVH if that is to be initiated tonight,
   dosing would be 500 mg IV Q 12 hours.
   6. Would hold on antifungal therapy for now, should she develop
   candidemia would start antifungal therapy.
   7. Would find out if additional CSF is available for analysis for
   14-3-3 protien as marker of possible variant CJD.
   8. Might consider ENT evaluation given bleeding in oropharnx and
   from around tracheostomy as this might be an additional source
   driving infection.
   9. Would send C diff toxin assay if stools

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, anasarca ARF, and recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a presumed pulmonary embolism per TTE. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis with hypothermia prior to CVVH, bradycardia, leukocytosis, non-convulsive status epilepticus, acute renal failure, presumed pulmonary embolism, and constipation. The patient is currently on broad empiric coverage with caspofungin, flagyl, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of sepsis with leukocytosis, hypothermia, and hypotension. It is important to continue monitoring for any further signs of infection or septic shock.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has recurrent pseudomonal VAP, which requires aggressive treatment and close monitoring.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a presumed PE, which needs to be confirmed and managed accordingly.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing ARF, and CVVH has been initiated. It is crucial to monitor kidney function and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Status epilepticus: The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted for tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient's course has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute respiratory failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), and ileus.

The patient remains unresponsive in a pentobarb coma to suppress seizure activity, with evidence of sepsis overnight including hypothermia and bradycardia. Broad empiric coverage with caspofungin, flagyl, and vancomycin has been added overnight. There are multiple potential sources of infection, including nondiarrheal Clostridium difficile, abdominal distention with possible perforation, fungal infection, and line infection.

The patient's prognosis is poor, and ongoing family discussions are being held regarding goals of care. Active issues remain, including sepsis with hypothermia prior to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), bradycardia, leukocytosis, non-convulsive status epilepticus, ARF with metabolic acidosis and volume overload, presumed PE with bleeding from the mouth and nose, respiratory failure with gross volume overload, and hypotension with the need for double pressors.

s son [**Name (NI) 2429**] and updated him regarding his mother
   current status.  She continues to decline, with suspected recurrent
   sepsis overnight with hypothermia, prior to CVVH, and bradycardia.
   Broadened antibacterial and antifungal coverage was added and dopamine
   added to levophed for bradycardia.   Now on CVVH.  Neuro team
   recommending steroids for? Hashimotos encephalopathy given elevated
   antithyroglobulin ab.  Steroids may benefit neuron status, though the
   risks of worsening infection were discussed.  Will initiate steroids,
   understanding that infectious risks in this critically ill pt are real
   and that she might die from overwhelming infection. We are continuing
   aggressive empiric antbx coverage at this time.
   Discussed as well that given her progressive decline, with MOSF, it is
   my medical opinion and that of the other team members that CPR in the
   setting of cardiac arrest would be ineffective and potentially harmful
   to this pt.  [**Doctor Last Name 2429**] expressed complete understanding of these updates.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, known seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient's course has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute respiratory failure with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), sepsis, and ileus. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient remains unresponsive in pentobarb coma to suppress seizure activity.
2. Hypotension: The patient is now on double pressors, with dopamine added in the setting of decompensation overnight with bradycardia.
3. Recurrent VAP: The patient has had multiple infectious risks as evidenced by sputum growing Pseudomonas and yeast in urine and sputum.
4. Progressive ARF/Gap metabolic acidosis/volume overload: The patient has extreme volume overload contributing to respiratory issues, bowel issues/ileus.
5. Presumed PE: The patient has bleeding from the mouth, nose, and lines, and holding heparin due to bleeding risks.
6. Uremic platelet dysfunction: The patient's platelet count is low, which may contribute to bleeding risks.
7. Constipation/ileus/"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, known seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient's course has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute respiratory failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), ileus, and sepsis.

The patient remains unresponsive in pentobarbital coma to suppress seizure activity, with evidence of sepsis overnight including hypothermia and bradycardia. Broad empiric coverage with caspofungin, Flagyl, and vancomycin was added overnight. There are multiple potential sources of infection including nondiarrheal Clostridium difficile, abdominal distention with possible perforation, fungal infection, and line infection.

The patient's other active issues include non-convulsive status epilepticus, acute kidney injury (ARF) with metabolic acidosis and volume overload, presumed PE with bleeding from the mouth and nose, respiratory muscle weakness, pseudomonal pneumonia, hypotension requiring double pressors, leukocytosis with multiple infectious risks, yeast in urine and sputum, constipation/ileus/abdominal distention, and limited ability to evaluate as CT abdomen will be of little help.

The patient's prognosis is extremely poor, and ongoing family discussions regarding goals of care are being conducted. The patient's condition continues to deteriorate with new problems developing. The attending physician believes that continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) does not appear to be a bridge to recovery. However, it may be reasonable to consider CVVH pending further neurological recommendations and transition off pentobarbital coma.

Overall, the patient's current medical complications include sepsis, non-convulsive status epilepticus, ARF, PE, VAP, ileus, and multiple infectious risks. The patient's condition is critical, and she is critically ill with an extremely poor prognosis."

   -  Limited ability to eval for bowel perf, lateral decub negative for
   free air but with air/fluid levels.
   -  holding on tap effusions given high peep requirements and risk
   - continue with dopamine and norepi
   - daily blood cx
   - lft

   - check lactates TID
   .
   # Non-convulsive status epilepticus
   - Given 1x dose of steroids yesterday for possible CNS vasculitis
   hashimotos.  Tolerated well but with no appreciable change in mental
   status.  Repeat dose today.
   - remains burst suppressed in pentobarb coma --> on depakote
level not

   - CVVH started Tuesday,acidosis improving slowly - lactate elevated to
   8 overnight, but now normalizing.
   -poor prognosis CVVH does not appear as bridge to recovery.
   -CVVH dosing of all meds
   - goal to remove as much fluid as possible, delicate balance b/w
   pressor requirements and fluid removal - MAP's not tolerating fluid
   removal yesteday.

   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-19**] to holding TF's, antibiotics.
   - Check DIC labs.
   - Consider FFP/Vitamin K if continues to worsen.

   # Resp Failure: Multifactorial [**1-19**] volume overload, PE, PNA
   -          volume removal with CVVH -> not tolerating, but will do best
   possible to minimize volume overload.

   # Constipation
 neurogenic, ileus/obstruction -> no free air on lateral
   decub.
   - edema/bowel wall edema contributing substantially
   - limited ability to evaluate as ct abd will be of little help as will

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, anasarca ARF, recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia, and presumed pulmonary embolism. She has multiple medical complications including sepsis, hypothermia, bradycardia, leukocytosis, non-convulsive status epilepticus, acute kidney injury/failure, coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and constipation. The patient's prognosis is poor, and discussions about end-of-life care are ongoing with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is below normal, indicating hypothermia. This can be caused by sepsis or other factors and can affect the heart and other vital organs.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has a slow heart rate, which may be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions. Bradycardia can reduce blood flow to vital organs and lead to organ failure.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an immune response to infection. Leukocytosis can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not managed appropriately.
5. Non-conv"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, anasarca ARF (acute renal failure), recurrent pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia, and presumed pulmonary embolism. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, non-convulsive status epilepticus, acute respiratory failure, presumed pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, constipation, and poor prognosis with progressive decline.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent infections, including pseudomonal pneumonia and fungemia. This indicates a high risk for developing sepsis due to the presence of multiple infections.
2. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is experiencing non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is a type of seizure that does not involve convulsions. This condition can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical intervention.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure has worsened, leading to acute respiratory failure. This is a critical condition that requires urgent treatment to support the patient's breathing.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a presumed pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage in one or more arteries in the lungs. This can be caused by blood clots traveling to the lungs from other parts of the body. It is a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, known seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline of unclear origin. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute respiratory failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), ileus, recurrent sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOSF). The patient remains unresponsive in a pentobarbital coma to suppress seizure activity. Active issues include sepsis with multiple potential sources, non-diarrheal Clostridium difficile infection, abdominal distention with possible perforation, fungal infection, line infection, skin infection, effusions/empyema, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

Plan:
- Continue broad empiric coverage with caspofungin, flagyl, and vancomycin.
- Continue anti-PSA coverage with ciprofloxacin.
- Hold on tapping effusions given high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirements and risks of pneumothorax.
- Burst suppress in pentobarbital coma and continue on diphenylhydantoin, keppra, and dilantin (follow levels at goal of 20).
- Dose adjustments per nephrologist in setting of continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
- Solumedrol (equivalent of prednisone 50) given for suspected Hashimoto encephalopathy/vasculitis.
- Extreme volume overload contributing to respiratory issues/desaturation, bowel issues/ileus.
- Remain on CVVH with attempts at volume removal as blood pressure tolerates.
- CVVH dosing of all medications.
- Hold heparin due to bleeding from mouth, nose, lines, and uremic platelet dysfunction.
- Continue assisted mechanical ventilation and not wean candidate given gross volume overload.
- Add dopamine to pressors in setting of decompensation with bradycardia.
- Transfuse for hematocrit (Hct) <21, type and cross.
- Administer vitamin K (likely due to medications and poor nutrition).
- Follow up cultures and continue empiric antibiotic and antifungal treatment.
- Hold total parenteral nutrition (TPN) given high risk of fungal infection and significant volume overload.
- Continue to reassess nutrition.
- Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
- Continue prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Code status: Do not resuscitate (DNR), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) felt to be ineffective.
- Disposition: Intensive care unit (ICU).
- Total time spent: 45 minutes.
- The patient is critically ill."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, known seizures disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient has been experiencing non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute respiratory failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), ileus, and other complications.

The patient's condition continues to decline with progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Active issues remaining include sepsis with multiple potential sources, non-diarrheal Clostridium difficile infection, abdominal distention possibly leading to perforation, fungal infection, line infection (changed yesterday), skin infection, effusions/empyema, and limited ability to evaluate bowel perfusion and ischemia.

The patient remains unresponsive in pentobarbital coma to suppress seizure activity. Broad empiric coverage with antibiotics and antifungals is being continued for multiple potential infectious sources. Antipseudomonal treatment with ciprofloxacin is also being administered. Efforts are being made to remove excess fluid through continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to volume overload contributing to respiratory issues and desaturation, as well as bowel issues/ileus.

Other ongoing concerns include presumed PE with bleeding from the mouth,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of respiratory failure with chronic ventilator dependence, seizure disorder. She presented with hypoxemia after a possible aspiration event. The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has chronic pseudomonal colonization in the lungs and yeast in the urine, which suggests an ongoing infection.

2. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is being treated with antiepileptic drugs (Depakote, Keppra, and Dilantin) and is undergoing weaning off pentobarbital coma.

3. Acute renal failure, likely ATN (acute tubular necrosis): The patient's renal function is impaired, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) is being used to manage fluid overload and metabolic acidosis.

4. Metabolic acidosis: Improving with CVVH and bicarbonate administration.

5. Volume overload: A result of acute renal failure and IV resuscitation with sepsis.

6. Respiratory failure: The cause is unknown, but the current ventilator settings are 400/16, PEEP 15, and FiO2 60%.

7. RV (right ventricular) strain: Presumably due to a pulmonary embolism (PE), despite subcutaneous heparin, with mucosal bleeding on heparin gtt, which was turned off.

8. Coagulopathy: Coagulation factors are elevated in the setting of sepsis and poor nutrition. Vitamin K was given yesterday with some improvement.

9. Constipation: The patient had a bowel movement overnight spontaneously.

10. ICU care: The patient's nutrition is being managed, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP is being provided.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ dysfunction including respiratory, renal, metabolic, infectious, and coagulation systems. Immediate medical attention should focus on addressing sepsis, non-convulsive status epilepticus, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and RV strain."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, chronic vent dependence, seizure disorder, and recent presentation with hypoxemia after possible aspiration event. She is currently in the ICU due to multiple health issues including sepsis, non-convulsive status epilepticus, acute renal failure, volume overload, metabolic acidosis, and RV strain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has chronic pseudomonal colonization in the lungs and yeast in the urine, indicating a possible infection leading to sepsis. This condition can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is currently on antiepileptic drugs, but there is a need to monitor drug levels and adjust doses as per neurology recommendations. If left untreated or poorly managed, this condition can lead to further neurological complications.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being utilized to manage renal failure, but if not adequately controlled, it can result in worsening renal function and electrolyte imbalances.

4. Volume overload: The patient has fluid overload due to acute renal failure and IV resuscitation with sepsis. CVVH is being used to address this issue, but if not effectively managed, it"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on vent, known seizures disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient has multiple medical complications including non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute renal failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), ileus, recurrent sepsis, and coagulopathy with bleeding. 

The patient remains unresponsive in pentobarb coma to suppress seizure activity. Although metabolic numbers improved with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), underlying issues remain unchanged. Active issues include sepsis with multiple potential sources, non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension, ARF, presumed PE, ileus, and coagulopathy with bleeding.

The plan includes continuing broad empiric coverage with caspofungin, metronidazole, and vancomycin, considering tapering off metronidazole once ruled out for Clostridium difficile infection. The patient will be monitored for line infections and effusions/empyema. Antii-PSA coverage with ciprofloxacin will be continued. 

Non-convulsive status epilepticus management includes weaning pentobarbital and remaining on depakote,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and chronic vent dependence. She presented with hypoxemia after a possible aspiration event. The patient has several ongoing medical issues including sepsis, leukocytosis, non-convulsive status epilepticus, acute renal failure, volume overload, metabolic acidosis, RV strain, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has chronic pseudomonal colonization in the lungs and yeast in the urine, abdominal distention concerning for perforation, chronic indwelling lines, and chronic effusions with possible empyema. These factors increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
3. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is on antiepileptic medications, but the seizure activity continues. This increases the risk of further neurological complications.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, likely ATN in the setting of sepsis. This could lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
5. Volume overload: The patient is fluid overloaded, which can result in pulmonary edema and compromised cardiac function.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis, which can be caused"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, known seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted after tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute renal failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), ileus, and recurrent sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including non-diarrheal Clostridium difficile (C. diff), abdominal distention, fungal infection, line infection, skin breakdown, and effusions. Broad empiric coverage with caspofungin, metronidazole, and vancomycin is being continued. Consider discontinuing metronidazole once ruled out for C. diff and vancomycin and caspofungin after fungal and blood cultures return positive (ID input appreciated).

2. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient remains unresponsive in a pentobarbital coma to suppress seizure activity. Depakote, Keppra, and Dilantin have been started, and it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of recurrent seizures.

3. Hypotension: Dopamine has been added due to bradyc"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator, known seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted after tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient's hospital course includes non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia, progressive acute respiratory failure with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism, ileus, and recurrent sepsis.

The patient remains unresponsive in a pentobarb coma to suppress seizure activity. Although metabolic numbers appear improved since starting continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), underlying issues remain unchanged. Steroids were recently added for suspected Hashimoto's encephalopathy with a plan to wean off pentobarb and reassess for potential recurrent seizure or neurological improvement, although the prognosis remains extremely poor.

Active issues include sepsis with multiple potential sources, non-diarrheal Clostridium difficile, abdominal distention, fungal infection, line infection, skin breakdown, and possible empyema. The patient is now on steroids for central nervous system further increasing infectious risks.

The plan is to continue broad empiric coverage with caspofungin, Flagyl, and vancomycin. Consider discontinuing Flagyl once ruled out for C. difficile. Vancomycin and caspofungin will be discontinued after fungal and blood cultures return positive (ID input appreciated)."

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, known seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurologic decline. She was admitted after tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute respiratory failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), ileus, and recurrent sepsis.

The patient remains unresponsive in a pentobarb coma to suppress seizure activity. Although metabolic numbers appear improved since starting continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), underlying issues remain unchanged. Steroids have been added recently for suspected Hashimoto's encephalopathy with a plan to wean off pentobarb and reassess for potential recurrent seizures or neurologic improvement, though prognosis remains extremely poor.

Active issues include sepsis with multiple potential sources, non-diarrheal Clostridium difficile, abdominal distention, fungal infection, line infection, skin breakdown, and effusions. The patient is on broad empiric coverage with caspofungin, Flagyl, and vancomycin. Consideration is being given to discontinuing Flagyl once ruled out for C. difficile and vancomycin and caspofungin after fungal and blood cultures return positive (ID input appreciated).

Steroids have been added recently for suspected Hashimoto's encephalopathy with a plan to wean off pentobarb and reassess for potential recurrent seizures or neurologic improvement.

Active issues remaining include sepsis with multiple potential sources, non-diarrheal Clostridium difficile (C. diff), abdominal distention, fungal infection, line infection, skin breakdown, and effusions. The patient is currently on steroids for central nervous system (CNS) further increasing infectious risks. White blood cell (WBC) count is increasing, which may be due to steroids. Platelets are dropping. No evidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is present on cultures. It"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, known seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia. During her hospital course, she has experienced non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute respiratory failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), ileus, sepsis, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient remains unresponsive in a pentobarb coma to suppress seizure activity. Despite improvements in metabolic numbers since starting continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), underlying issues remain unchanged. Steroids have been added for suspected Hashimoto's encephalopathy, with plans to wean off pentobarbital and reassess for potential recurrent seizures or neurological improvement, although the prognosis remains extremely poor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including ileus, question of Clostridium difficile (no diarrhea, abdominal distention), fungal infection, line infection, skin breakdown, and effusions. She is currently on steroids for central nervous system involvement, further increasing infectious risks.
2. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient remains on depakote, Keppra, and Dilant"

   active issues currently include:
   .
    Sepsis: Treating pseudomonal pneumonia with meropenem/cipro.  and
   yeast in the urine, abdominal distention concerning for perforation,
   chronic indwelling lines, chronic effusions with ? empyema,
   non-diarrheal c. diff.
   - Vanc/caspo/flagyl are empiric at this time, flagyl day 1 ([**5-7**]),
   Vancomycin (day 1 = [**4-27**]?), caspofungin (day 1 = [**5-7**])
   - Norepi/dopa to maitain MAPs >60
   - Fluid overloaded, continue CVVH, goal maintain CVP > or = 10.
   - continue broad coverage with vancomycin, meropenam, ciprofloxacin,
   flagyl and caspofungin per ID recs
   - Follow up micro data, ID requesting daily surveillance blood cultures
   with one set of mycolytics
   - ID recs
   - Check beta glucan and galactomannan
   .
   Leukocytosis: In the setting of sepsis, and increasing in the setting
   of steroids
   -continue to monitor, getting treated empirically with anti-microbials
   as indicated above
   -daily surveillance cultures
   .
   Non-convulsive status epilepticus: Off pentobarb gtt - no new status,
   continuing solumedrol IV for now.
   -On depakote, keppra, and dilantin, following levels and adjusting
   doses prn per neuro recs
   -pentobarb coma off, will await status of burst suppression per neuro
   -?Hashimoto's encephalitis, giving solumedrol at 50mg IV daily
   .
   Acute renal failure, ATN in the setting of sepsis/ hypotension,
   bicarbonate stable
   -CVVH per protocol
   -renal following
   .
   Volume overload: result of acute renal failure in the setting of IV
   resuscitation with sepsis
   -CVVH aggressively take off fluid with MAP>60 unless substantial
   increase in pressor requirements or hypothermia
   .
   Metabolic acidosis: resolved with CVVH
   .
   RV strain: presumably due to a PE despite subcutaneous heparin, with
   mucosal bleeding on heparin gtt, which was turned off.
   -Holding heparin gtt at this time for complication of bleeding
   .
   Respiratory failure: multifactorial etiology [**1-19**] pna, overload,
   presumed PE, current settings 400/16, PEEP 15 FiO2 60%
   -Decrease FiO2 to 40%

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of respiratory failure, chronic ventilator dependence, and seizure disorder. The patient presented with hypoxemia after a possible aspiration event and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is being treated for pseudomonal pneumonia with meropenem/ciprofloxacin. Discontinuation of caspofungin and vancomycin was recommended by the ID team. There is an ongoing concern about the patient's colonization with virulent organisms.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely due to sepsis and hypotension. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is being performed as per protocol.
3. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient is being monitored for non-convulsive status epilepticus. Pentobarbital coma has been discontinued, and the patient is receiving solumedrol IV. Neurological assessments are ongoing.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated coagulation parameters due to sepsis and poor nutrition. Vitamin K has been administered, and further investigations are planned.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to infection or medication effect. Further evaluation for HIT (hepar"

    Active issues remain:
   # Sepsis
   Multiple potential sources
 ileus question of c diff (no diarrhea, abd
   distention), fungal infection, line infection, skin breakdown effusions
   To date cxs growing only PSA (sp) and yeast in urine and sp. Now on
   steroids for CNS further increasing infectious risks. WBC increasing,
   which may be due to steroids. Platelets dropping. No e/o MRSA anywhere
   on cxs. Will peal off Vanc, and keep on other 4 antibiotics to cover
   cdiff, pseudomonas and yeast. Will peel off 1 antibiotic everyday.
   Continues to be on pressors and neg on CVVH. WBC increased today, may
   be due to steroids. Daily cxs. Check cdiff.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, known seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline. She was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia.

The patient's hospital course has been complicated by non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute renal failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), ileus, and recurrent sepsis. She remains unresponsive in a pentobarb coma to suppress seizure activity. 

Despite improvements in metabolic numbers since starting continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), underlying issues remain unchanged. The patient is also being treated for suspected Hashimoto's encephalopathy with plans to wean off pentobarb and reassess for potential recurrent seizures or neurological improvement. However, the prognosis remains extremely poor.

Active issues remaining include sepsis with multiple potential sources such as ileus, question of Clostridium difficile (no diarrhea, abdominal distention), fungal infection, line infection, skin breakdown, and effusions. Steroids have been added to the treatment plan for the suspected Hashimoto's encephalopathy, further increasing infectious risks. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, which may be due to steroids. Platelets are dropping. No evidence of methicillin-resistant"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure on ventilator support, a history of seizure disorder, and recent progressive neurological decline of unclear etiology. The patient was admitted following tube feed aspiration and witnessed seizure with altered mental status and hypoxemia.

During the hospital course, the patient has experienced non-convulsive status epilepticus, hypotension requiring pressors, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progressive acute renal failure (ARF) with anasarca, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), ileus, and recurrent sepsis.

The patient remains unresponsive in a pentobarb coma to suppress seizure activity. Although metabolic numbers appear improved since starting continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), underlying issues (MOSF) remain unchanged.

Active issues remaining include sepsis, non-convulsive status epilepticus, ARF with gap metabolic acidosis and volume overload, respiratory failure, presumed PE, thrombocytopenia, constipation/ileus/abdominal distention, and goals of care discussion with the family regarding the patient's poor prognosis and progressive slow decline.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, recurrent VAP, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and ongoing sepsis.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management of these potential"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with PMH respiratory failure with chronic vent dependence, seizure
   disorder, presented with hypoxemia after possible aspiration event,
   active issues currently include:
    Sepsis/ VAP: Treating pseudomonal pneumonia with meropenem/cipro.
   Discontinued caspofungin and vancomycin per ID recs
   -Continue [**Last Name (un) 430**]/cipro for PSA PNA, though unclear if this patient will
   ever not be colonized with virulent organisms
   - Norepi/dopa to maitain MAPs >60
   - Culture if spikes, no more surveillance cultures.
   - ID recs
   - Check beta glucan and galactomannan, pending
   Non-convulsive status epilepticus: Off pentobarb gtt - no new status,
   continuing solumedrol IV for now.  No change in underlying mental
   status, but will continue to assess.
   -On depakote, keppra, and dilantin, following levels and adjusting
   doses prn per neuro recs
   -pentobarb coma off, will await status of burst suppression per neuro.
   Will not change doses of antiepileptics as patient currently not in
   status.
   -?Hashimoto's encephalitis, giving solumedrol at 50mg IV daily
   .
   Acute renal failure, ATN in the setting of sepsis/ hypotension,
   bicarbonate stable.  We trailed CVVH in an attempt to clear her mental
   status in the setting of acute uremia.  However, given that the patient
   has not had improvement in her mental status, it is unlikely that
   continuing CVVH will improve her overall course.  Therefore we will
   transition to HD if possible and stop CVVH.  This will also help with
   transition of care to a chronic facility.
   -renal following
   Volume overload: result of acute renal failure in the setting of IV
   resuscitation with sepsis
   - will continue to try and diurese.  Will trial furosemide as BP
   tolerates today
   Metabolic acidosis: resolved with CVVH, likely due to her renal failure
   RV strain: presumably due to a PE despite subcutaneous heparin, with
   mucosal bleeding on heparin gtt, which was turned off.
   -Holding heparin gtt at this time for complication of bleeding.  It
   seems less likely that the RV strain was caused by PE that has not been
   untreated for >5 days.
   Respiratory failure: multifactorial etiology [**1-19**] pna, overload,
   presumed PE.  Current vent settings 400x16 with a PEEP of 10 and FiO2
   of 50%, most recent VBG 7.31
   - Monitor VBG
s and adjust prn
   Coagulopathy: coags elevated in the setting of sepsis and poor
   nutrition, s/p dose of vitamin K  with some improvement
   -Active type and cross
   -Transfuse HCT <21
   - hold tube feeds for now given bloody return from peg tube.
   Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**1-19**] to infection, follow-up smear for ? HIT,
   ?medication effect from PPI
   - trend, transfuse for active bleeding if < 50K or ,<10K
   - hold heparin products
   Constipation: having BM

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of respiratory failure with chronic ventilator dependence, seizure disorder, and other comorbidities. She presented with hypoxemia after a possible aspiration event and has been diagnosed with various conditions including sepsis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), non-convulsive status epilepticus, acute renal failure, volume overload, metabolic acidosis, right ventricular strain, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and constipation.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications and treatments, including antibiotics for pseudomonal pneumonia, antiepileptic drugs for seizure management, sedatives for coma induction, and supportive care for organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs and laboratory results are also documented, indicating ongoing monitoring and management of her condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's current health status include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient has chronic ventilator dependence, she is at an increased risk of developing VAP. This infection can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of mortality.

3. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The patient's seizure disorder puts her at risk for recurrent seizures,"
