","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mild Alzheimer's dementia. She presents with syncope, bradycardia, and sinus pauses. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been treated with dobutamine, a medication used to increase heart rate and blood pressure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 51 bpm with sinus bradycardia, blood pressure ranging from 109/47 to 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The physical examination reveals a supple neck with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 7 cm, point of maximal impulse (PMI) located at the 5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line, bibasilar rales on lung auscultation, soft abdomen with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly, and pulses that are 2+ bilaterally in the carotid, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis (DP), and posterior tibial (PT) arteries.

Laboratory results show sodium level of 224 meq/L, potassium level of 11.9 meq/L, chloride level of 133 meq/L, bicarbonate level of 0"

2. CORONARIES: No known coronary artery disease (CAD), symptoms, and ECG do not suggest acute ischemia. Rule out myocardial infarction (MI) with repeat ECG and last set of cardiac enzymes in the patient's medical record (PM).
3. PUMP: No known dysfunction, appears euvolemic to slightly hypervolemic with rales possibly due to atelectasis on exam. Monitor fluid status, consider trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) to evaluate left ventricular function and possibility of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement with pacemaker.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mild Alzheimer's dementia. The patient presented with syncope, bradycardia, and sinus pauses.

Assessment and plan:
1. Rhythm: The patient appears to have sinoatrial block due to sinus node dysfunction. Dobutamine infusion was weaned off overnight, and the heart rate has been stable in the 70s. Atenolol, diltiazem, lisinopril, and donepezil are being held.
   - Monitoring over the weekend to see if the native rhythm remains stable without nodal agents

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mild Alzheimer's dementia. She presented with syncope, bradycardia, and sinus pauses. The patient's rhythm appears to be sinoatrial block due to sinus node dysfunction. She has been on dobutamine, which was weaned off overnight and her heart rate has been stable in the 70s. Anti-hypertensives are being held due to bradycardia and hypotension. Lisinopril and HCTZ are being restarted. Donepezil is being held because it can cause AV block and bradycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm: The patient's sinus node dysfunction may lead to continued episodes of bradycardia and sinus pauses. Monitoring over the weekend will determine if her native rhythm remains stable without nodal agents. Electrophysiology (EP) recommendations should be followed. Atropine should be kept at the bedside, and anti-hypertensives should be held due to bradycardia and hypotension.
2. Coronaries: No active issues were noted in the patient's coronary arteries. However, further evaluation may be necessary in the future.
3. Pump: The patient appears euvolemic, but ongoing monitoring of fluid status is important. Awaiting a transthoracic echocardi"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mild Alzheimer's dementia. She presented with syncope, bradycardia, and sinus pauses. The patient is currently being monitored in the CCU and is on dobutamine infusion. Her vital signs are stable, and she is responding well to the treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of sinus node dysfunction and is currently experiencing sinoatrial block. Close monitoring of the heart rhythm is necessary to ensure the maintenance of a stable rhythm.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low (48 bpm), which can lead to reduced cardiac output and inadequate perfusion of vital organs. Continuous monitoring of the heart rate and prompt intervention if bradycardia persists or worsens are essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side (118/65 mmHg). It is important to monitor the blood pressure regularly and adjust medications as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has a history of hyponatremia, which has been resolved. Regular monitoring of electrolyte levels, particularly sodium levels, is necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Fluid Balance: The patient appears euvolemic, but close monitoring of fluid"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mild Alzheimer's dementia. She presented with syncope, bradycardia, and sinus pauses. She was found to have a sinoatrial block and was started on dobutamine, which was later discontinued. The patient's heart rate has been stable in the 70s without any further symptomatic episodes or events on telemetry. She has been ambulating without symptoms. It is recommended to hold pacemaker placement, keep pads on and atropine at bedside, and hold nodal agents (diltiazem and atenolol). The patient will continue taking lisinopril 20 mg (plan to titrate to 30 mg) and HCTZ 25 mg. Aricept has been held due to its potential to cause AV block and bradycardia. There are no active coronary issues, and the patient appears euvolemic. Fluid status will be monitored, and a follow-up echo is planned. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, so HCTZ and lisinopril have been restarted, and nodal agents have been held. The plan is to titrate up lisinopril to 30 mg daily. The patient's dyslipidemia will be managed with a home statin, GERD with a home PPI, and Alzheimer's dementia will be"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mild Alzheimer's dementia. She presented with syncope, bradycardia, and sinus pauses. The patient was found to have sinus node dysfunction, which was treated by holding beta-blockers atenolol and diltiazem. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she has been ambulating without symptoms. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate (61 bpm) may require further evaluation and management.
2. Hypertension: The patient has elevated blood pressure (155/69 mmHg), for which lisinopril and HCTZ were restarted. Titration of lisinopril to 30 mg daily is planned.
3. Dyslipidemia: The patient's lipid levels need to be monitored and managed appropriately.
4. GERD: The patient has been prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for ongoing management of GERD.
5. Alzheimer's dementia: The patient's mild Alzheimer's dementia should be managed with ongoing care and support.
6. Potential need for pacemaker: The patient may require a permanent pacemaker (PPM) if her condition does not improve.
7. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
8. Pain management: The patient is on Tylenol for pain management.
9. Bowel regimen: The patient is on a bowel regimen with Colace, Senna, and Dulcolax.
10. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels need to be monitored and managed appropriately."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mild Alzheimer's dementia. She presented with syncope, bradycardia, and sinus pauses. Her current medications include atenolol, diltiazem, and Aricept. The patient has been holding up well without any further symptomatic episodes or events on telemetry. She was able to ambulate without symptoms as well.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Rhythm: The patient has sinoatrial block and may require a pacemaker placement.
   - Keep pads on and atropine at bedside.
   - Holding nodal agents (diltiazem and atenolol).
   - Continue Lisinopril 20 mg and HCTZ 25 mg.
   - Plan to titrate Lisinopril to 30 mg daily.
   - Hold Aricept due to its potential to cause AV block and bradycardia.

2. Coronaries: No active issues. CEs negative.

3. Pump: The patient appears euvolemic.
   - Continue to monitor fluid status.
   - Await TTE to evaluate for LV function and possibility of ICD placement with pacemaker.

4. Hypertension: Restarted HCTZ and Lisinopril. Holding nodal agents.
   - Plan to titrate up Lisinopril to"
