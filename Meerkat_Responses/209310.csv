","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of back pain and difficulty walking. The patient has a history of osteoporosis and has been on long-term corticosteroid therapy for chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Upon admission, the patient was started on antibiotics due to a suspected infection, and an MRI of the lumbar spine revealed a lateral impingement on the L5 nerve root. The patient underwent a spine consultation, where it was decided not to proceed with surgery at this time. The patient was also given Decadron for pain management. Renal recommendations included pamidronate, calcitonin, and D5W to correct sodium levels. Urology was consulted for further evaluation of possible malignancy. Allergies to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were documented, and the patient was infused with heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Morphine sulfate was administered for pain control. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 149/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids, and fluid balance shows a deficit of 682 mL since midnight. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.42. Physical examination revealed the patient to be awake, alert, and somewhat confused"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with an initial chief complaint of back pain. The patient was admitted to the emergency department and subsequently transferred to the ICU due to worsening symptoms. Upon admission, the patient had multiple medical conditions, including an elevated calcium level of 14.8 mg/dL, confusion, and a history of malignancy.

Over the course of the patient's stay in the ICU, several interventions were performed. An arterial line was started, and blood cultures were sent from the emergency department. The patient received antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin, for suspected infection. Heparin sodium was administered for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient also received morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient's vital signs were monitored closely, showing a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate between 112-115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/72 mmHg to 159/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm was noted as sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance was closely monitored, with a total input of 5,718 mL and output of 6,400 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient received intravenous fluids and blood products.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, change in mental status, acute renal failure, and a calcified mass in the bladder with evidence of scattered lytic lesions. The patient was treated empirically for a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the emergency department with broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the patient's blood pressure has not dropped since arrival, and lactate levels have decreased from 4.4 to 1.8 after intravenous fluids, suggesting less likelihood of sepsis.

The patient also presents with hypernatremia, total free water deficit approximately 6 liters, and a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) less than 1%, indicating pre-renal azotemia. The patient's urine osmolarity is 262, indicating profound dehydration. The patient's neurologic examination is difficult due to confusion, but there are signs of potential neurologic involvement, such as urinary incontinence.

Further assessments and plans include:
1. Fever: Follow-up urine culture, continue treatment for UTI, and send blood cultures from the emergency department.
2. Hypernatremia: Slowly correct sodium levels by adding D5W to intravenous fluids, aiming for a correction rate of 10 mEq/L per hour.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Avoid nephrotoxic agents, continue hydration, and consider renal recommendations.
4. Lytic lesions: Evaluate for possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M with fever, change in MS, ARF, and calififed mass in the
   bladder and evidence of scattered lytic lesions.
   .
   # Fever: Pt with UTI, treated empirically in ED with broad spectrum
   abx. Has not dropped BP since arrival, lactate down to 1.8 from 4.4
   after IVF, so less likely to be septic now. Other possibilities include
   CNS infection, although competing causes for both MS as well as fever;
   CXR negative for PNA but dry so infiltrate could blossom, but no
   reported cough.
   - Follow up urine cx: GNR so far
   - Cipro for UTI
   - Blood cx sent from ED
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Total free water deficit approx 6 L. FeNa is < 1%
   suggesting largely pre-renal. Urine osms 262. Appears profoundly
   dehydrated on exam. Na corrected to 152 this AM, currently on D5W at
   200/hr.
   - Goal correction is
 mEq every hour
   .
   # ARF: Pt was obstructed intially given such large UOP after foley
   placed. FeNa pre-renal.
   - No hydro by CT scan
   - Appreciate Renal recs
   - Avoid nephroxins
   - Continue hydration
   .
   # Lytic lesions: Likely mets from bladder ca, but MM also in
   differential. One met noted on L5 vertebra with thecal sac indentation.
   Difficult neuro exam and pt unable to indicate whether he is having sxs
   related to compression but MAE, nl rectal tone; however given urinary
   incontinence, concern for neuro involevement.
   - Stat MRI to evaluate for cauda/cord compression: one nerve root
   impingment
   - Spine consult
   - Decadron given b/c exam unreliable
   - Elevated PSA ? prostate ca
   - SPEP/UPEP: pending
   .
   # Mental status: Received Haldol and morphine in ED in order to obtain
   scans. Now in MICU pt is very somnolent, not following commands.
   Suspect multifactorial etiology: fever/UTI, hypernatremia,
   hypercalcemia. CNS infection is possibility, although low suspicion.
   Now improving this AM.
   - IVF
   - Treat UTI
   - Treat hypercalcemia
   .
   # Bladder mass: New dx. ? primary bladder vs prostate-related (elevated
   PSA).
   - Urine cytology sent
   - Urology c/s: following, will assist with tissue
   - Onc c/s once cytology/tissue obtained
   .
   # Anemia: Guaiac negative in ED.
   - Send off iron studies: does not appear to have iron deficiency anemia
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21 (likely Hct drop in setting of fluid
   resuscitation)
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Ca [**02**] in setting of lytic lesions seen on CT, which
   could also be contributing to MS.
   - Continue hydration
   - Send off PTH (normal), PTHR-peptide, Vit D, 1,25, TSH (normal)
   - SPEP, UPEP for possible MM: pending
   - Pamidronate and calcitonin per Renal recs
   - Hold diuretic given ARF
   .
   # EKG changes: STD in infero lateral leads, may be rate-related
   ischemia, no STE, first set CE negative.
   - Cycle CE
   .
   # Deconditioning: Pt appears malnourished and chronically ill. Albumin
   low at 2.9
   - Will need TF: hold for now (at risk for refeeding)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a fever, change in mental status, acute renal failure (ARF), and a calcified mass in the bladder with evidence of scattered lytic lesions. He has hypernatremia, anemia, hypercalcemia, and EKG changes. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is suspected to have cancer, possibly prostate cancer. He requires further evaluation and treatment for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. CNS infection: The patient has a fever and change in mental status, which raises concern for a central nervous system (CNS) infection. Monitoring for signs of increased intracranial pressure or meningeal irritation is important.
2. Septic shock: Despite being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's blood pressure has not improved. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is crucial to detect any signs of septic shock.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and urine output. Close monitoring of renal parameters and adjusting the fluid management plan accordingly is essential.
4. Bladder cancer: The presence of a calcified mass in the bladder raises concern for bladder cancer. Further evaluation with urine cytology and urology consultation is necessary for tissue diagnosis and staging.
5. Prostate cancer: Elevated PSA levels suggest the possibility of prostate cancer. Additional investigations such as prostate-specific"

   -          Urine Cx: >100,000 GNR
   -          Blood cx: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M with fever, change in MS, ARF, and calififed mass in the
   bladder and evidence of scattered lytic lesions.
   .
   # Fever: Pt with UTI, treated empirically in ED with broad spectrum
   abx. Has not dropped BP since arrival, lactate down to 1.8 from 4.4
   after IVF, so less likely to be septic now. Other possibilities include
   CNS infection, although competing causes for both MS as well as fever;
   CXR negative for PNA but dry so infiltrate could blossom, but no
   reported cough.
   - Follow up urine cx: GNR so far
   - Cipro for UTI
   - Blood cx sent from ED
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Total free water deficit approx 6 L. FeNa is < 1%
   suggesting largely pre-renal. Urine osms 262. Appears profoundly
   dehydrated on exam. Na corrected to 152 this AM, currently on D5W at
   200/hr.
   - Goal correction is
 mEq every hour
   .
   # ARF: Pt was obstructed intially given such large UOP after foley
   placed. FeNa pre-renal.
   - No hydro by CT scan
   - Appreciate Renal recs
   - Avoid nephroxins
   - Continue hydration
   .
   # Lytic lesions: Likely mets from bladder ca, but MM also in
   differential. One met noted on L5 vertebra with thecal sac indentation.
   Difficult neuro exam and pt unable to indicate whether he is having sxs
   related to compression but MAE, nl rectal tone; however given urinary
   incontinence, concern for neuro involevement.
   - Stat MRI to evaluate for cauda/cord compression: one nerve root
   impingment
   - Spine consult
   : following, want full spine MR
   - Elevated PSA ? prostate ca
   - SPEP/UPEP: pending
   .
   # Mental status: Received Haldol and morphine in ED in order to obtain
   scans. Now in MICU pt is very somnolent, not following commands.
   Suspect multifactorial etiology: fever/UTI, hypernatremia,
   hypercalcemia. CNS infection is possibility, although low suspicion.
   Now improving this AM.
   - IVF
   - Treat UTI
   - Treat hypercalcemia
   .
   # Bladder mass: New dx. ? primary bladder vs prostate-related (elevated
   PSA).
   - Urine cytology sent
   - Urology c/s: following, will assist with tissue
   - Onc c/s once cytology/tissue obtained
   .
   # Anemia: Guaiac negative in ED.
   - Send off iron studies: does not appear to have iron deficiency anemia
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21 (likely Hct drop in setting of fluid
   resuscitation)
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Ca [**02**] in setting of lytic lesions seen on CT, which
   could also be contributing to MS.
   - Continue hydration
   - Send off PTH (normal), PTHR-peptide, Vit D, 1,25, TSH (normal)
   - SPEP, UPEP for possible MM: pending
   - Pamidronate and calcitonin per Renal recs
   - Hold diuretic given ARF
   .
   # EKG changes: STD in infero lateral leads, may be rate-related
   ischemia, no STE, first set CE negative.
   - Cycled CE: negative
   .
   # Deconditioning: Pt appears malnourished and chronically ill. Albumin
   low at 2.7
   -          Will need TF: hold for now (at risk for refeeding)
   -          Nutrition c/s for recs

   IMAGING:
   -          [**9-14**] MRI: multilevel cervicothoracic met disease, most sever
   T2 with mild retropulsion which appears to contact the anterior
   thoracic cord; multilevel [**Last Name (un) 1220**] disc changes, most severe at T7/8 with
   disc protrusion which compresses ant aspect thoracic cord
   -
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M with fever, change in MS, ARF, and calcified mass in the
   bladder and evidence of scattered lytic lesions.
   .
   # Fever/UTI: Pt with UTI, treated with cipro. Has not dropped BP since
   arrival, lactate down to 1.8 from 4.4 after IVF, so less likely to be
   septic now. Other possibilities include CNS infection, although
   competing causes for both MS as well as fever; CXR negative for PNA but
   dry so infiltrate could blossom, but no reported cough.
   - Follow up urine cx: GNR so far, but culture contaminated
   - Cipro for UTI
   - Blood cx sent from ED pending
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Total free water deficit on admission approx 6 L. FeNa
   is < 1% suggesting largely pre-renal. Urine osms 262. Appears
   profoundly dehydrated on exam. Na corrected to 152, back up after NS
   boluses for tachycardia
   - Goal correction is
 mEq every hour
   - Continue correction, encourage PO water
   .
   # ARF: Pt was obstructed intially given such large UOP after foley
   placed. FeNa pre-renal.
   - No hydro by CT scan
   - Appreciate Renal recs
   - Avoid nephroxins
   - Continue hydration
   .
   # Metastatic  lesions: ? mets from bladder ca, prostate ca, but MM also
   in differential. One met noted on L5 vertebra with thecal sac
   indentation. Difficult neuro exam and pt unable to indicate whether he
   is having sxs related to compression but MAE, nl rectal tone; however
   given urinary incontinence, concern for neuro involvement.
   - MRI entire spine done
   - Spine consult: reviewed MRI, NTD now, following along
   - Elevated PSA ? prostate ca
   - SPEP: negative
   - UPEP: pending
   .
   # Mental status: Received Haldol and morphine in ED in order to obtain
   scans. Now in MICU pt is very somnolent, not following commands.
   Suspect multifactorial etiology: fever/UTI, hypernatremia,
   hypercalcemia. CNS infection is possibility, although low suspicion.
   Now improving this AM.
   - IVF
   - Treat UTI
   - Treating hypercalcemia
   .
   # Bladder mass: New dx. ? primary bladder vs prostate-related (elevated
   PSA).
   - Urine cytology pending
   - Urology c/s: following, will assist with tissue
   - Onc c/s once cytology/tissue obtained
   .
   # Anemia: Guaiac negative in ED.
   - Send off iron studies: does not appear to have iron deficiency anemia
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21 (likely Hct drop in setting of fluid
   resuscitation)
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Ca [**02**] in setting of lytic lesions seen on CT, which
   could also be contributing to MS.
   - Continue hydration
   - Send off PTH (normal), PTHR-peptide, Vit D, 1,25, TSH (normal)
   - SPEP, UPEP for possible MM
   - Pamidronate and calcitonin per Renal recs
   - Hold diuretic given ARF
   .
   # Tachycardia: Initially attributed to profound dehydration, was
   improving, overnight persistently tachy to 120 despite NS boluses.
   Other considerations: pain (denies), and PE (sats have always been in
   mid-90s since admission).
   - If tachy persists, consider PE eval (likely needs VQ [**1-7**] renal
   function)
   .
   # Deconditioning/Malnourished: Pt appears malnourished and chronically
   ill. Albumin low at 2.7
   -          Will need TF: hold for now (at risk for refeeding)
   -          Nutrition c/s for recs
   .
   # FEN: Clears/water

   # PPx: IV H2 blocker, heparin sq, boots

   # Access: PIVs

1. Chief Complaint: The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note.

2. 24-Hour Events:
   - The patient underwent a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that revealed multilevel cervicothoracic metastatic disease, most severe at T2 with mild retropulsion contacting the anterior thoracic cord. There are also multilevel disc changes, most severe at T7/8 with disc protrusion compressing the anterior aspect of the thoracic cord.
   - Dex 4 QD was started.
   - Normal saline (NS) 1 L bolus x 2 was given for tachycardia, but there was no change, and the patient denies pain.
   - Blood cultures are pending.
   - SPEP (serum protein electrophoresis) negative.

3. Allergies:
   No known drug allergies are mentioned.

4. Last dose of antibiotics:
   Ceftriaxone was administered on [**2197-9-11**] at 04:34 PM, and Ciprofloxacin was given on [**2197-9-14**] at 12:30 AM.

5. Infusions:
