","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma involving the right face and a history of facial bleeding. He was transferred to the ICU with active facial bleeding and is currently undergoing transfusion of blood and saline. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and his first HCT is stable. Coagulation tests are pending, and the patient's HCT will be monitored overnight. ENT will formally staff in the morning, and neuroradiology will take the patient for embolization in the morning. The wound is wrapped, and the patient will continue to receive blood transfusions while actively bleeding. Supportive care will be provided with saline and PRBCs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of facial bleeding and is currently experiencing active bleeding from the fungating growth of squamous cell carcinoma. Close monitoring of HCT levels and timely administration of blood products will be necessary to maintain stable hemodynamics and prevent further blood loss.
2. Infection: The patient's wound has been cultured with Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient is being covered with cefazolin and ciprofloxacin to treat the infection. Frequent monitoring of vital signs and wound appearance is important to detect any signs of worsening infection.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient underwent emergent nasotracheal int"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma involving the right face and a history of facial bleeding. He was transferred to the ICU with active facial bleeding. The patient received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight and is currently being transfused with blood and saline. His blood pressure has remained stable since ICU transfer, and he has not shown signs of tachycardia. Coagulation studies are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's history of facial bleeding and ongoing active bleeding indicate a high risk for further bleeding complications. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic stability, and continuous assessment of the bleeding site are necessary.

2. Respiratory Issues: The patient underwent emergent nasotracheal intubation due to the upcoming procedure. It is essential to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, ensuring proper airway management and ventilation support if needed.

3. Infection: The presence of Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the wound culture indicates a risk of infection. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be maintained, and regular assessment of the wound should be performed to monitor for any signs of infection.

4. Nutritional Support: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), awaiting extubation. Once stable, nutritional support"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma involving the right face. He was transferred to this hospital for a second opinion and subsequently experienced significant bleeding from the tumor, requiring nasal intubation and 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient remains critically ill and is currently dependent on transfusions due to ongoing bleeding.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Facial SCC: The patient has significant bleeding from the tumor, and further management is required. ENT follow-up and embolization by neuroradiology are planned. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels will be monitored, and transfusions will be given as needed while actively bleeding.
2. Respiratory Status: The patient underwent emergent nasotracheal intubation for airway protection and in anticipation of embolization. The patient remains intubated for airway protection/procedures and may have a pressure support (PS) trial this afternoon after the procedure.
3. Wound: Cultures from the open surgical site (OSH) have grown acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient is being treated with ciprofloxacin and cefazolin.
4. Elevated WBC count: The patient's elevated white blood cell count is likely due to a leukoemoid reaction to chronic severe anemia. If the WBC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma involving the right face. He was transferred to the ICU for a second opinion and subsequently experienced significant bleeding from the tumor, requiring nasal intubation and 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient remains intubated for airway protection and in anticipation of embolization. He has ongoing respiratory issues and is dependent on oxygen supplementation. His wound is infected with acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to a leukoerythroblastic reaction to chronic severe anemia. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires aggressive fluid resuscitation. He is on multiple medications for prophylaxis, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable due to the large squamous carcinoma involvement of the right face. He underwent nasotracheal intubation for airway protection and in anticipation of embolization. However, he remains intubated for airway protection/procedures and may be at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with invasive right facial squamous cell carcinoma who has been admitted to the ICU. He required nasal intubation due to significant bleeding from the tumor and received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100°F (37.8°C), heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on invasive ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, oxygen level (PaO2) of 204, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 21 mEq/L. His lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.3 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 41.7 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 342 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, and his imaging shows clear chest X-ray (CXR). The patient's current assessment includes facial SCC causing significant bleeding, respiratory status requiring emergent nasotracheal intubation, wound infection with acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and elevated WBC count possibly due to leukemoid reaction to chronic severe anemia or facial infection with potential cavernous thrombosis. The plan includes ENT follow-up, embolization per neuroradiology, monitoring Hct and transfusing while actively bleeding to keep above 25, continuation of respiratory support, and antibiotic therapy for wound infection. The patient's code status is DNR, and a family meeting will be held later today with ENT/palliative care colleagues."

 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   57 y/o M with large R face SCC with brisk hemorrhage through it.
   # Facial SCC:
   - ENT said not a candidate for surgical debridement given brisk bleed
   from mass, and mostly necrotic locally invasive tissue.
   - Embolization per neuroradiology today
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 **], transfuse while actively bleeding to keep > 25
   - Heme onc and rad onc consults for palliation
   # ID: Wound cultured with acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and
   MSSA.
   - Continue Cipro and cefazolin per sensitivities and clindamycin to
   empirically cover anaerobes
   - Follow WBC, temp
   # Respiratory Status:  emergently underwent nasotracheal intubation for
   airway protection and in anticipation of embolization.
   - Remains intubated for airway protection/procedures
   - SBT and extubate soon after procedures
   - Unable to advance NTT, since it is hubbed tip 11 cm from carina, safe
   at the moment
   # Leukocytosis: BM stress of brisk bleed/anemia vs paraneoplastic from
   cancer vs infection from organisms cultured from wound as above. Follow
   clinically.
   # Code status: DNR.
   It will be important to readdress goals of care with the patient and
   family. We will try to wean sedation in the AM and discuss his wishes
   again. I would favor proceeding with IR embolization procedure in 2
   days only if patient wishes to live in hospice care. If he expresses
   wish to be CMO, the procedure should not be done. Palliative care
   consulted
 their input is much appreciated. They have already seen the
   patient but will return tomorrow.

The patient underwent emergent nasotracheal intubation for airway protection and in anticipation of embolization. He remains intubated for airway protection/procedures.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics to cover various organisms cultured from his wound, including Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). His blood counts show leukocytosis, which could be due to stress from the brisk bleed/anemia, paraneoplastic syndrome from cancer, or infection from the cultured organisms. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and it is planned to discuss goals of care with the patient after extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has had a significant bleed, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and instability in blood pressure and heart rate.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is currently intubated due to airway protection and remains at risk for respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Infection: The patient has multiple organisms cultured from his wound, indicating a risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any signs of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) presenting with brisk hemorrhage. He has received multiple blood transfusions and intravenous fluids. The patient is currently sedated and intubated via nasotracheal tube due to an unstable airway. He is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been diagnosed with leukocytosis and his blood cultures show growth of Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). His blood tests reveal an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time with a slightly low international normalized ratio. The patient's electrolytes and kidney function are within normal limits. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway Compromise: The patient's airway is currently unstable due to the large facial mass and brisk hemorrhage. There is a risk of further airway compromise, especially during procedures or if the patient's condition deteriorates.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and growth of bacteria in his blood cultures. There is a risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection or sepsis if appropriate antibiotics are not administered.
3. Bleeding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and ongoing brisk hemorrhage through it. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and intravenous fluids (IVF). He is hemodynamically stable. ENT does not feel he is a candidate for surgical intervention. The plan is for embolization in the morning. 

The patient underwent emergent nasotracheal intubation to protect the airway and oxygenate/ventilate well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) 5/5. He is sedated and follows commands. The endotracheal tube (ETT) is high by last chest X-ray (CXR). 

The patient's wound is cultured with Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) at OSH. He will be covered with cefazolin and ciprofloxacin as per sensitivities, as well as clindamycin for oropharyngeal flora (poor dentition). 

The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to the stress of brisk bleeding/anemia, paraneoplastic syndrome from cancer, or infection from organisms cultured from the wound. 

The patient is NPO until after procedures. He has been placed on pneumoboots, bowel regimen, pain management, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and brisk hemorrhage through it. He has received multiple blood transfusions and intravenous fluids. The patient underwent embolization of bilateral sphenopalatine arteries yesterday and will have facial artery embolization tomorrow. He is currently intubated and sedated. 

Medical Complications:
1. Facial bleeding/facial mass: The patient has a large fungating growth of SCC with ongoing bleeding. This is the primary concern and will require further management.
2. Respiratory status: The patient was emergently intubated to protect his airway during a procedure and to ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Continuous nasotracheal intubation with VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) bundle is recommended.
3. Wound infection: The patient's wound is colonized with Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He is being covered with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin based on sensitivities.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to stress from the bleed/anemia, paraneoplastic syndrome from cancer, or infection from organisms cultured from the wound.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has mild hypercalcemia, which could be secondary to"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right face. The tumor required nasal intubation and multiple packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions. The patient has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions. His most recent hematocrit (Hct) level is 29.1.

The patient underwent embolization of the bilateral sphenopalatine arteries at interventional radiology (IR) and plans for facial artery embolization in the next 48 hours. He was given vitamin K due to an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.6. The facial lesion is growing Acinetobacter and Enterobacter.

The patient has allergies to morphine and experiences rashes as a side effect. He received various antibiotics, including cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam.

His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/62 mmHg to 145/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a set volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). His blood glucose levels are within normal range, but he has hypercalcemia, elevated lactate, low magnesium, and low potassium levels.

The patient is intubated for airway protection and continues to be on mechanical ventilation until embolization. He also has hypercalcemia, which is likely related to malignancy with bony destruction, and leukocytosis with a slight left shift. 

The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) for the upcoming procedure tomorrow. His code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and a family meeting is planned to discuss the goals of care."

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma of the right face that required nasal intubation and multiple packed red blood cell transfusions due to significant bleeding. The patient has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions. The patient's recent hematocrit (Hct) level is 29.1. The patient underwent embolization of bilateral sphenopalatine arteries at interventional radiology (IR) and is planning for facial artery embolization in the next 48 hours. The patient was given vitamin K for an elevated INR of 1.6. The facial lesion is growing Acinetobacter and enterobacter.

The patient has allergies to morphine, which caused a rash. The last doses of antibiotics administered were cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam (Versed). Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged from admission.

The review of systems is unchanged except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/62 mmHg to 145/71 mmHg,"

s note. The above note
   reflects our discussion. I would add the following:
   57 yr old with T4 cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma involving the right
   face c/b severe bleeding down to a Hct of 6 requiring ~20 units of
   PRBC. He underwent embolization of the sphenopalatine artery yesterday
   with plan to embolize facial artery tomorrow. Remains intubated for the
   procedures, currently sedated on versed 2mg and fent 75 mcg. Wbc has
   increased to 59 today, question of leukemoid reaction. I observed the
   mass during dressing change by ENT intern. There is ongoing oozing,
   felt to be worse compared to yesterday. The CT head was reviewed but
   final report is pending. There will be a family meeting today to decide
   on goals of care, including the utility of 2nd embolization vs extubate
   today and d/c to hospice, etc.  40 minutes critical care time

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and brisk hemorrhage through it. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and intravenous fluids. He is currently hemodynamically stable.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory status: The patient underwent nasotracheal intubation to protect the airway during a procedure. There were transient desats after reintubation, which improved with recruitment maneuvers. The placement of the nasotracheal tube is tenuous at the cords without possibility of advancement. Continuous nasotracheal intubation with a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle should be continued.

2. Wound infection: The patient's wound has been cultured with Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He will be covered with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin as per sensitivities, with discontinuation of cefazolin due to MSSA sensitivity to clindamycin.

3. Psychiatric issues: The patient's psych issues are unclear and he is not on any medications. Further evaluation and consultation with a psychiatrist may be necessary.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to stress of brisk bleed/anemia, paraneoplastic"

   intubation in preparation of procedure in early admission for
   procedures and to protect airway, now intubated x ~ 5 days.  Pulled NTT
   this AM.  Acute hypoxia overnight and change in CXR likely represents
   mucous plug, though timing of events not clearly chronologic, thus ?
   other etiologies for hypoxia.  Underwent oral intubation in OR this AM
   for hypoxia, not for procedures.  Family continues to stress desire to
   extubate when possible.
   -bronch today to attempt mucous plug removal
   -wean and extubate ASAP pending ability to breath independently after
   bronch, or other reasons for hypoxia must be excluded.  Currently
   satting well on high fiO2
   - propofol for sedation, change fentanyl to PRN in preparation for
   extubation
   - consider broadening antibiotics to cover VAP
   # Fevers: spiking fevers to 101.  Antibiotic coverage for his wound.
   Other concerns would be VAP given 4-5 days of intubation, increasing
   sputum.  WBC overall stable.  Other sources of fever could be
   medications, cancer, recent embolization.
   - bronch today
   - expand antibiotics to cover VAP pending results of bronch
   #.Facial Bleeding/facial mass: From large fungating growth of squamous
   cell carcinoma. The patient has multiple blood transfusions.  O/W, he
   is HD stable.  ENT does not feel he is a candidate for surgical
   intervention. Embolized sphenopalatine arteries yesterday.  Plan for
   facial artery embolization only prn for bleeding.
   -keep wound dressed
   - Follow Hct daily unless active bleeding, transfuse to keep HCT > 25
   -embolization as above
   -f/u hematology/oncology recs and neuroradiology recs re: palliative
   radiation, further plan, etc
   -palliative care recs are appreciated
   - will consult rad/onc
 to see after extubation
   #. Wound: Cultured with acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA
   at OSH. Will covering with ciprofloxacin as per sensitivities for
   acinetobacter and clinda for enterobacter and MSSA per sensitivies and
   empirically for oropharyngeal flora (poor dentition).   Cefazolin
   discontinued.
   - Continue antibiotics
   # psych: unclear psych issues, on no medications.  Background info.
   # Leukocytosis: BM stress of brisk bleed/anemia vs paraneoplastic from
   cancer vs infection from organisms cultured from wound as above. Follow
   clinically.   See above re: fevers.
   - will check diff
   - heme/onc is following
   # Hypercalcemia:  Mild.  ? secondary to bone erosion vs. PTHrP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma and brisk hemorrhage.
- He underwent emergent nasotracheal intubation for a procedure and to protect the airway, and has been intubated for approximately 5 days.
- The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but there was acute hypoxia overnight, which may be due to a mucous plug or other etiologies.
- Oral intubation was performed in the operating room this morning for hypoxia, not for procedures.
- The family desires to extubate the patient when possible.
- A bronchoscopy will be performed today to attempt mucous plug removal.
- Weaning and extubation will be considered as soon as possible, pending the ability to breathe independently or excluding other reasons for hypoxia.
- Propofol will be used for sedation, and fentanyl will be changed to PRN in preparation for extubation.
- Antibiotics may be broadened to cover ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has spiking fevers to 101 degrees, and antibiotic coverage for the wound is necessary.
- Other sources of fever could include medications, cancer, or recent embolization.
- A bronch will be performed today, and antibiotics may be expanded to cover VAP pending the results.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous carcinoma of the right face. The patient has been in the ICU and has experienced several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a significant bleed from the tumor requiring nasal intubation and multiple PRBC transfusions. This indicates a risk of ongoing bleeding.

2. Infection: The patient has had a fever and cultures were sent. This suggests the possibility of an infection, which can be a serious complication in ICU patients.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory status is monitored closely due to being on mechanical ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 96%, but there are fluctuations in tidal volume (Vt) and respiratory system resistance (RSBI). These factors indicate potential respiratory complications.

4. Cardiovascular problems: The patient's blood pressure readings show wide fluctuations, ranging from 90/42 mmHg to 161/79 mmHg. This suggests unstable cardiovascular status and the risk of hypotension or hypertension.

5. Neurological issues: The patient's neurological status is not assessed in the progress note, which indicates the need for further evaluation and monitoring for potential neurological complications.

6. Bleeding disorders: The patient's platelet count (Plt) is within normal range, but other coagulation parameters such as prothrombin time"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous carcinoma of the right face and significant bleeding. He required nasal intubation and multiple packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions. The patient has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions. His most recent hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is 29.1. He underwent embolization in the neurointerventional radiology (neuroIR) on [**3-13**] in the spenopalatine arteries, but another round of embolization is needed for the facial artery. His temperature spiked to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, and cultures were sent. The patient's family decided to proceed with a second embolization. He received vitamin K and intravenous fluids (IVF). The nasogastric (NG) tube was pulled out this morning, and he went to the operating room for endotracheal tube (ETT) placement.

   57 y/o M with large R face SCC with brisk hemorrhage through it.
   #. Respiratory Status: Patient emergently underwent nasotracheal
   intubation in preparation of procedure in early admission for
   procedures and to protect airway, now intubated x ~ 5 days.  Pulled NTT
   this AM.  Acute hypoxia overnight and change in CXR likely represents
   mucous plug, though timing of events not clearly chronologic, thus ?
   other etiologies for hypoxia.  Underwent oral intubation in OR this AM
   for hypoxia, not for procedures.  Family continues to stress desire to
   extubate when possible.
   -bronch today to attempt mucous plug removal
   -wean and extubate ASAP pending ability to breath independently after
   bronch, or other reasons for hypoxia must be excluded.  Currently
   satting well on high fiO2
   - propofol for sedation, change fentanyl to PRN in preparation for
   extubation
   - consider broadening antibiotics to cover VAP
   # Fevers: spiking fevers to 101.  Antibiotic coverage for his wound.
   Other concerns would be VAP given 4-5 days of intubation, increasing
   sputum.  WBC overall stable.  Other sources of fever could be
   medications, cancer, recent embolization.
   - bronch today
   - expand antibiotics to cover VAP pending results of bronch
   #.Facial Bleeding/facial mass: From large fungating growth of squamous
   cell carcinoma. The patient has multiple blood transfusions.  O/W, he
   is HD stable.  ENT does not feel he is a candidate for surgical
   intervention. Embolized sphenopalatine arteries yesterday.  Plan for
   facial artery embolization only prn for bleeding.
   -keep wound dressed
   - Follow Hct daily unless active bleeding, transfuse to keep HCT > 25
   -embolization as above
   -f/u hematology/oncology recs and neuroradiology recs re: palliative
   radiation, further plan, etc
   -palliative care recs are appreciated
   - will consult rad/onc
 to see after extubation
   #. Wound: Cultured with acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA
   at OSH. Will covering with ciprofloxacin as per sensitivities for
   acinetobacter and clinda for enterobacter and MSSA per sensitivies and
   empirically for oropharyngeal flora (poor dentition).   Cefazolin
   discontinued.
   - Continue antibiotics
   # psych: unclear psych issues, on no medications.  Background info.
   # Leukocytosis: BM stress of brisk bleed/anemia vs paraneoplastic from
   cancer vs infection from organisms cultured from wound as above. Follow
   clinically.   See above re: fevers.
   - will check diff
   - heme/onc is following
   # Hypercalcemia:  Mild.  ? secondary to bone erosion vs. PTHrP.
   - IV hydration
   - trend Ca
   #. FEN: Will need OGT if not extubated today.  S/S after extubation
   # PPx:
   - pneumoboots, bowel regimen, pain management, PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who underwent an emergent nasotracheal intubation due to acute hypoxia and change in chest X-ray. The patient was previously admitted for procedures and had a mucous plug in the left lung. He underwent oral intubation in the operating room for hypoxia and not for procedures. The family desires extubation as soon as possible, but only if the patient can breathe independently. The patient has been on high FiO2 and propofol for sedation. Antibiotic coverage has been broadened to include hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and a bronchoscopy is planned to remove the mucous plug. The patient has been experiencing spiking fevers to 101 degrees Fahrenheit, and antibiotic coverage for his wound has been initiated. There are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given 4-5 days of intubation and increasing sputum production. Other potential sources of fever include medications, cancer, and recent embolization. The patient has a large fungating growth of SCC with brisk hemorrhage through it, and ENT does not feel he is a candidate for surgical intervention. Embolization of the sphenopalatine arteries was performed yesterday, and a plan for facial artery embolization is in place for bleeding. The patient's wound culture showed growth of Acinetobacter,"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o M with large R face SCC s/p hemorrhage from facial mass.
   1) Ventilator-associated pneumonia:  Patient electively underwent
   nasotracheal intubation in preparation for facial embolization
   procedure, now intubated x  6 days with difficulty weaning from vent.
    Patient sustained left lung collapse on [**2-12**] with subsequent
   bronchoscopy that revealed thick, copious secretions.  Secretions
   continue to limit ventilator independence.   Currently he is on
   vancomycin/zosyn (day #2 of 8) for VAP.
   - Wean vent as tolerated, but defer extubation until secretions reduced
   - Pulmonary toilet
   - start standing mucolytics
   - f/u BAL fluid culture
   - propofol gtt sedation, with fentanyl PRN
   2) Facial mass:  Patient has large fungating unresectable SCC mass s/p
   brisk bleed to hematocrit of ~6.  He has been transfusion-dependent.
   ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection of mass as
   therapeutic option given involvement of skull margins.  Now s/p
   bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.
   -          Reconsult Neuro IR as needed for facial artery embolization
   -          Dressing changes daily, as per ENT recs
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 25
   -          RadOnc to evaluate for palliative radiation once patient is
   able to participate in decision making ([**Pager number 4404**])
   -          Heme/Onc following
   -          Palliative Care following
   3)       Wound infection:  Facial mass with culture data from OSH
   positive for acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA.   He was
   previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, now covered with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   4)  Leukocytosis:  Likely leukomoid reaction vs. infection.
   - continue to trend
   5) Hypercalcemia:  Likely secondary a paraneoplastic process as humoral
   hypercalcemia of malignancy by secretion of PTHrP is commonly seen in
   squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
   - IV hydration
   - trend Ca
   6) FEN:  Initiate tube feeds today
   - Continue maintenance IVF @ 100 cc/hour
   - replete KCl
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:  Initiate tube feeds today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who underwent a bronchoscopy for left lung collapse. The patient has been intubated for 6 days and is experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator. He has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics.

The patient also has a facial mass that bled briskly, resulting in a low hematocrit level. The mass is unresectable due to involvement of skull margins, and the patient has been transfusion-dependent. The patient underwent bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.

The patient's wound infection culture showed positive results for Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He was previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, but now he is being covered with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to a leukemoid reaction or infection. His calcium level is elevated, likely secondary to a paraneoplastic process as humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is commonly seen in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

The patient is being initiated on tube feeds today and will continue"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   57M with large squamous carcinoma of R face with significant bleed
   tumor requiring nasal intubation and multiple PRBC transfusions.
   Currently hemodynamic status. Patient has a history of not wanting
   aggressive medical interventions, but agreed to intubation for
   embolization. Embolized in neuro IR on [**3-13**] sphenopalatine artery
   embolized, now bleeding  mostly stopped --continues to ooze.
   Unfortunately had mucous plug of L mainstem today, s/p bronch with lots
   of mucous plugs, BAL sent, started on vanco/zosyn for empiric coverage.
   1. resp failure: Initially intubated for airway protected, now appears
   to have HAP/VAP
   -propofol gtt, drop fentanyl to 25 mcg/h
   -plan to SBT tomorrow am, PS trial today
   -guafenesin
   2. SCC with bleed:
   -check post transfusion hct
   -facial art embolization if acute bleed
   3. ID: Possible VAP, MSSA, enterobacter, and acinetobacter in OSH mass
   cx
   -cont. vanco/zosyn X10days
   4. FEN: Ca improved, suspect [**2-19**] malignancy
   -TF today, off after MN for SBT
   -[**Month (only) 202**] IVF to NS at 100/h
   5. Lekocytosis: Improving, may be leukomoid reaction
   -f/u heme recs
   6. Goals of care: family has been updated daily. If weaning from vent
   becomes difficult in next 1-2 days, will need to discuss terminal wean
   as patient clearly expressed his reluctance to be intubated, even for
   embolization.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous carcinoma of the right face, which required nasal intubation and multiple packed red blood cell transfusions. The patient has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions but agreed to intubation for embolization. He was embolized in neuro IR on [**3-13**] sphenopalatine artery, and the bleeding has mostly stopped but continues to ooze. The patient also experienced a mucous plug in the left mainstem today, following a bronchoscopy with lots of mucous plugs, and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was sent. He was started on vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage.

The patient's current hemodynamic status is stable, but he has developed fever and tachycardia. His respiratory status is compromised, as indicated by the need for intubation initially for airway protection, and now appears to have hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to sedate the patient further with propofol and decrease fentanyl to 25 mcg/h. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be attempted tomorrow morning, and a pressure support (PS) trial will be done today. Gaufenesin will be administered.

Regarding the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with bleed, the plan is to check post-transfusion hematocrit (H"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o M with large R face SCC s/p hemorrhage from facial mass.
   1) Ventilator-associated pneumonia:  Patient electively underwent
   nasotracheal intubation in preparation for facial embolization
   procedure, now intubated x  6 days with difficulty weaning from vent.
   Patient sustained left lung collapse on [**2-12**] with subsequent
   bronchoscopy that revealed thick, copious secretions.  Secretions
   continue to limit ventilator independence.   Currently he is on
   vancomycin/zosyn (day #3 of 8) for VAP.
   - Wean vent as tolerated, but defer extubation until secretions reduced
   - Pulmonary toilet
   - start standing mucolytics
   - f/u BAL fluid culture
   - propofol and fentanyl gtt for sedation
   - Will arrange family meeting to discuss plan for transition to comfort
   should patient fail extubation
   2) Facial mass:  Patient has large fungating unresectable SCC mass s/p
   brisk bleed to hematocrit of ~6.  He has been transfusion-dependent.
   ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection of mass as
   therapeutic option given involvement of skull margins.  Now s/p
   bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.
   -          Reconsult Neuro IR as needed for facial artery embolization
   -          Dressing changes daily, as per ENT recs
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 25
   -          RadOnc to evaluate for palliative radiation once patient is
   able to participate in decision making ([**Pager number 4404**])
   -          Heme/Onc following
   -          Palliative Care following
   3)       Wound infection:  Facial mass with culture data from OSH
   positive for acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA.   He was
   previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, now covered with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   4)  Leukocytosis:  Likely leukomoid reaction vs. infection.
   - continue to trend
   5) Hypercalcemia:  Likely secondary a paraneoplastic process as humoral
   hypercalcemia of malignancy by secretion of PTHrP is commonly seen in
   squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
   - IV hydration
   - trend Ca
   6) FEN:
   - Resume tube feeds today
   - d/c maintenance IVF given fluid overload
   - check PM K+ following repletion

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who presented with hemorrhage from the facial mass. He underwent nasal intubation in preparation for facial embolization and has been mechanically ventilated for 6 days. The patient has difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sustained left lung collapse on [**2-12**]. A bronchoscopy revealed thick, copious secretions. He is currently on vancomycin and zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's facial mass is unresectable due to involvement of skull margins, and he has been transfusion-dependent after a brisk bleed.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o M with large R face SCC s/p hemorrhage from facial mass.
   1) Ventilator-associated pneumonia:  Patient electively underwent
   nasotracheal intubation in preparation for facial embolization
   procedure, now intubated x  6 days with difficulty weaning from vent.
   Patient sustained left lung collapse on [**2-12**] with subsequent
   bronchoscopy that revealed thick, copious secretions.  Secretions
   continue to limit ventilator independence.   Currently he is on
   vancomycin/zosyn (day #2 of 8) for VAP.
   - Wean vent as tolerated, but defer extubation until secretions reduced
   - Pulmonary toilet
   - start standing mucolytics
   - f/u BAL fluid culture
   - propofol gtt sedation, with fentanyl PRN
   2) Facial mass:  Patient has large fungating unresectable SCC mass s/p
   brisk bleed to hematocrit of ~6.  He has been transfusion-dependent.
   ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection of mass as
   therapeutic option given involvement of skull margins.  Now s/p
   bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.
   -          Reconsult Neuro IR as needed for facial artery embolization
   -          Dressing changes daily, as per ENT recs
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 25
   -          RadOnc to evaluate for palliative radiation once patient is
   able to participate in decision making ([**Pager number 4404**])
   -          Heme/Onc following
   -          Palliative Care following
   3)       Wound infection:  Facial mass with culture data from OSH
   positive for acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA.   He was
   previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, now covered with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   4)  Leukocytosis:  Likely leukomoid reaction vs. infection.
   - continue to trend

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who sustained a hemorrhage from the facial mass. He underwent nasotracheal intubation and is now intubated for 6 days with difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient had a left lung collapse on [2-12] and bronchoscopy revealed thick, copious secretions. He is currently on vancomycin and zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's facial mass is unresectable, and he has been transfusion-dependent. Neuro IR performed bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization. The patient has a wound infection with Acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA, which was previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin. He is now covered with Vanc/Zosyn. The patient has leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, and is initiated on tube feeds. His code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

   HPI:
    57M with large squamous carcinoma of R face with significant bleed
   tumor requiring nasal intubation and multiple PRBC transfusions.
   Currently hemodynamically stable. Patient has a history of not wanting
   aggressive medical interventions, but agreed to intubation for
   embolization. Embolized in neuro IR on [**3-13**] sphenopalatine artery
   embolized, now bleeding stopped. Unfortunately had mucous plug of L
   mainstem [**3-15**] had bronch with lots of mucopurulent secretions, BAL
   sent, started on vanco/zosyn for empiric coverage. We are still trying
   to extubate to discuss his wishes further, however if not successful in
   next few days may have to readdress with family.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma of the right face, requiring nasal intubation and multiple packed red blood cell transfusions. He is currently hemodynamically stable and has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions. The patient underwent embolization of the sphenopalatine artery, which stopped the bleeding. Unfortunately, he developed a mucous plug in the left mainstem bronchus and was bronchoscoped with lots of mucopurulent secretions. He was started on vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage. The patient continues to have thick secretions and is being weaned off ventilator support. Allergies include morphine, and the last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin on 03/15/2198 at 12:04 PM.

24-hour events include continued thick secretions, weaning to 5-22 and 40% on ventilator support, starting guaifenesin, stopping TF to assess extubation, restarting TF due to severe secretions, and continuous monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance.

Physical examination shows well-nourished appearance, poor dentition, endotracheal tube, and OG tube in place. The patient responds to verbal stimuli and has symmetric chest expansion with bronchial breath sounds on the left base. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis, hypercalc"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and has been admitted to the ICU with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure due to HAP/VAP: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure. The current plan is to continue with vancomycin and zosyn for 8-10 days and attempt extubation tomorrow. If reintubation becomes necessary, it will be discussed with the family per the patient's wishes.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which could lead to pressure ulcers or infections. Regular repositioning and proper skin care should be implemented to prevent further complications.

3. Cancer (malignant neoplasm): The patient has SCC with bleeding, and although no further intervention is planned unless there is an acute bleed, monitoring for any signs of bleeding or worsening tumor-related complications is essential.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to a leukomoid reaction. Close monitoring of the complete blood count (CBC) is necessary to ensure no progression towards a more severe infection or other hematological abnormalities.

5. Hypercalcemia: The"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    57M with large squamous carcinoma of R face with significant bleed
   tumor requiring nasal intubation and multiple PRBC transfusions.
   Currently hemodynamically stable. Patient has a history of not wanting
   aggressive medical interventions, but agreed to intubation for
   embolization. Embolized in neuro IR on [**3-13**] sphenopalatine artery
   embolized, now bleeding stopped. Unfortunately had mucous plug of L
   mainstem [**3-15**] had bronch with lots of mucopurulent secretions, BAL
   sent, started on vanco/zosyn for empiric coverage. We are still trying
   to extubate to discuss his wishes further, however if not successful in
   next few days may have to readdress with family.
   24 Hour Events:
   Continued to have thick secretions. Weaned to [**5-22**] and 40%. Started
   guafenesin. Stopped TF to assess extubation, restarted due to severe
   secretions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right face that required nasal intubation and multiple packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions due to significant bleeding. The patient has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions, but agreed to intubation for embolization. The patient underwent embolization of the sphenopalatine artery, which stopped the bleeding. Unfortunately, the patient developed a mucous plug in the left mainstem bronchus and required bronchoscopy with lots of mucopurulent secretions. The patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn empiric coverage. The patient continues to have thick secretions and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL and respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygenation is maintained with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but the heart rate is slightly elevated. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. The patient has hypercalcemia, which is improving, and leukocytosis, which may be due to infection or a leukomoid reaction. The patient's platelet count is slightly low.

   57 y/o M with large R face SCC s/p hemorrhage from facial mass.
   1) Ventilator-associated pneumonia:  Patient electively underwent
   nasotracheal intubation in preparation for facial embolization
   procedure, now intubated x  7 days with difficulty weaning from vent.
   Patient sustained left lung collapse on [**2-12**] with subsequent
   bronchoscopy that revealed thick, copious secretions.  Secretions
   continue to limit ventilator independence.   Currently he is on
   vancomycin/zosyn (day #3 of 8) for VAP.  He continues to have thick
   secretions requiring roughly q 2 hr suctioning, though tolerating [**5-22**].
   - family meeting today re: goals of care and pt
s wishes, likely
   extubation with DNI. Discuss transition to comfort care if he fails
   extubation.
   - Pulmonary toilet
   - cont standing mucolytics
   - f/u BAL fluid culture
   - propofol and fentanyl gtt for sedation
   2) Facial mass:  Patient has large fungating unresectable SCC mass s/p
   brisk bleed to hematocrit of ~6.  He has been transfusion-dependent.
   ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection of mass as
   therapeutic option given involvement of skull margins.  Now s/p
   bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.
   -          Reconsult Neuro IR as needed for facial artery embolization
   -          Dressing changes daily, as per ENT recs
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 25 if bleeding, 21-24 if not
   bleeding significantly
   -          RadOnc to evaluate for palliative radiation once patient is
   able to participate in decision making ([**Pager number 4404**])
   -          Heme/Onc following
   -          Palliative Care following
   3)       Wound infection:  Facial mass with culture data from OSH
   positive for acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA.   He was
   previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, now covered with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   4)  Leukocytosis:  Likely leukomoid reaction vs. infection.
   - continue to trend
   5) Hypercalcemia:  Likely secondary a paraneoplastic process as humoral
   hypercalcemia of malignancy by secretion of PTHrP is commonly seen in
   squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial skin cancer (SCC) who has undergone embolization for hemorrhage. The patient is currently intubated and experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator. He has a history of left lung collapse and bronchoscopy that revealed thick, copious secretions. The patient is on vancomycin and zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and continues to have thick secretions requiring frequent suctioning.

The patient's facial mass is large, unresectable, and fungating. ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection due to involvement of skull margins. The patient has been transfusion-dependent following a brisk bleed. Bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR has been performed.

The patient's wound infection culture is positive for Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA. He was previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, and is now covered with vancomycin and zosyn.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which is likely a leukoemoid reaction or infection. Hypercalcemia is present and is likely secondary to a paraneoplastic process as humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy by secretion of PTHrP is commonly seen in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

Other findings include right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremity"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of a facial mass. The patient is currently receiving several medications, including mucomyst as a mucolytic, fentanyl infusion, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 95/57 to 134/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 0 mL, spontaneous tidal volume of 495 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 125.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, sodium, potassium, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, albumin, and liver enzymes. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but normal international normalized ratio (INR). Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 4,396 mL with 766 mL going into the total intravenous fluids,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous carcinoma of the right face that required nasal intubation and multiple PRBC transfusions due to significant bleeding. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions, but agreed to intubation for embolization. The embolization was performed on [**3-13**] in the sphenopalatine artery, which stopped the bleeding. However, the patient then experienced a mucous plug in the left mainstem bronchus, resulting in bronchoscopic aspiration with lots of mucopurulent secretions. Empiric coverage with vancomycin and zosyn was started. The patient is still being ventilated to discuss his wishes further, with a planned family meeting today at 12:30.

The patient has been intubated for 6 days and continues to have thick grey sputum, requiring suctioning every 1-2 hours. The plan is to discuss the goals of care with the family and continue vancomycin and zosyn therapy. The patient also has squamous cell carcinoma with no surgical options, likely resulting in poor quality of life and poor prognosis. This will be discussed during the family meeting. Additionally, the patient has hypercalcemia, likely due to malignancy, and leukocytosis, which could be a leukemoid reaction.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have been intubated for 6 days and are at risk for aspiration due to their inability to protect their airway. They also have impaired skin integrity, likely due to immobility or pressure ulcers. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), specifically squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with no surgical options available. This suggests a poor quality of life and prognosis. Additionally, the patient has hypercalcemia, which is improving and is likely related to malignancy. Leukocytosis is also present, which may be a leukemoid reaction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for 6 days and has thick grey sputum. They are at risk for developing VAP, a type of lung infection that can occur in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Aspiration: Due to the inability to protect their airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity suggests the possibility of developing pressure ulcers, which are sores that develop when constant pressure is applied to certain areas of the body, usually over bony prominences.
4. Infection: With a compromised immune system and prolonged immobility, the patient is at an increased risk of developing"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous carcinoma of the right face requiring nasal intubation and multiple PRBC transfusions. He is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions but agreed to intubation for embolization. The patient was embolized in neuro IR on 3-13 and the bleeding stopped. However, he had a mucous plug in the left mainstem bronchus on 3-15, resulting in bronchospasm and lots of mucopurulent secretions. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was sent, and he was started on vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage. The medical team is still trying to extubate the patient to discuss his wishes further, with a planned family meeting today at 12:30.

The patient has been intubated for 6 days and continues to have thick grey sputum. Suctioning is done every 1-2 hours. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 110/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been well-controlled.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o M with large R face SCC s/p hemorrhage from facial mass.
   1) Ventilator-associated pneumonia:  Patient electively underwent
   nasotracheal intubation in preparation for facial embolization
   procedure, now intubated x  7 days with difficulty weaning from vent.
   Patient sustained left lung collapse on [**2-12**] with subsequent
   bronchoscopy that revealed thick, copious secretions.  Secretions
   continue to limit ventilator independence.   Currently he is on
   vancomycin/zosyn (day #3 of 8) for VAP.  He continues to have thick
   secretions requiring roughly q 2 hr suctioning, though tolerating [**5-22**].
   - family meeting today re: goals of care and pt
s wishes, likely
   extubation with DNI. Discuss transition to comfort care if he fails
   extubation.
   - Pulmonary toilet
   - cont standing mucolytics
   - f/u BAL fluid culture
   - propofol and fentanyl gtt for sedation
   2) Facial mass:  Patient has large fungating unresectable SCC mass s/p
   brisk bleed to hematocrit of ~6.  He has been transfusion-dependent.
   ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection of mass as
   therapeutic option given involvement of skull margins.  Now s/p
   bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.
   -          Reconsult Neuro IR as needed for facial artery embolization
   -          Dressing changes daily, as per ENT recs
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 25 if bleeding, 21-24 if not
   bleeding significantly
   -          RadOnc to evaluate for palliative radiation once patient is
   able to participate in decision making ([**Pager number 4404**])

   positive for acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA.   He was
   previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, now covered with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   4)  Leukocytosis:  Likely leukomoid reaction vs. infection.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who has been intubated for 7 days. He has difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to thick copious secretions. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), facial mass with hemorrhage, wound infection, leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, and poor nutritional status. The patient's family has been involved in discussions regarding the goals of care and the patient's wishes, with a likely plan for extubation with do-not-intubate (DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's difficulty in weaning from the ventilator suggests the possibility of VAP. The presence of thick copious secretions limits ventilator independence.
2. Facial mass with hemorrhage: The patient has a large fungating unresectable SCC mass that has caused a brisk bleed to a hematocrit level of ~6. He is transfusion-dependent and may continue to bleed significantly.
3. Wound infection: The facial mass is positive for Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient was previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, but now is covered with vancomycin/zosyn.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who underwent nasal intubation for a facial embolization procedure. He has been intubated for more than 7 days and has difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient sustained left lung collapse on [**2-12**], and a bronchoscopy revealed thick, copious secretions. Secretions continue to limit ventilator independence. He is currently on vancomycin/zosyn (day #5 of 8) for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which started on [**3-15**]. 

The patient also has a facial mass that is unresectable and has caused a brisk bleed to a hematocrit level of approximately 6. He has been transfusion-dependent. ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection of the mass as a therapeutic option due to involvement of skull margins. The patient has undergone bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.

Additionally, the patient has a wound infection on the facial mass positive for Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA. He was previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin and is now covered with Vanc/Zosyn.

The patient has leukocytosis, likely a leukemoid reaction or infection. He also has hypercalcemia, likely secondary to a paraneoplastic process as humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy by secretion of PTHrP is commonly seen in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 

The patient has right upper extremity edema, suspected superficial thrombophlebitis versus upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to facial hemorrhage, so no further work-up is being done at this time to evaluate for clot.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl and propofol for sedation. The plan includes continuing conversation with the family regarding transition to comfort care if the patient fails extubation, pulmonary toilet, and follow-up bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for more than 7 days, and secretions continue to limit ventilator independence. He is currently on vancomycin/zosyn for VAP, but there is a risk of treatment failure or progression of the infection.
2. Facial mass with potential bleeding: The patient's facial mass is unresectable and has caused significant bleeding. There is a risk of further bleeding episodes, especially if the patient requires any invasive procedures or interventions.
3. Wound infection: The patient's facial wound is infected with multiple organisms, including Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA. There is a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma of the right cheek that required nasal intubation and multiple packed red blood cell transfusions due to significant bleeding. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions. However, the patient agreed to intubation for embolization, which was successfully performed by neuro interventional radiology to stop the bleeding. Unfortunately, the patient developed a mucous plug in the left mainstem bronchus, leading to increased mucopurulent secretions. A bronchoscopy was performed, and the patient was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam empiric coverage. The family and healthcare team decided to continue with intubation to see if the secretions improve in the next few days. If not, they will reassess the option of extubation. The patient's allergies include morphine, and he received a last dose of antibiotics on 03/19/2198 at 08:00 AM. The patient is currently on fentanyl and propofol infusions, along with other ICU medications. 

24-hour events include giving one unit of packed red blood cells for a declining hemoglobin concentration. A family meeting was held, and it was decided to continue with intubation for a few more days to observe any improvement in secretions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma of the right face. He required nasal intubation and multiple packed red blood cell transfusions due to significant bleeding. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions. However, he agreed to intubation for embolization. The patient underwent embolization of the sphenopalatine artery, which stopped the bleeding. Unfortunately, he developed a mucous plug in the left mainstem bronchus and was bronchoscoped with lots of mucopurulent secretions. He was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric coverage. A family meeting was held, and it was decided to continue intubation to see if his secretions improve in the next few days. If not, extubation will be readdressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently unable to protect his airway, and there is a risk of aspiration. He also has impaired airway clearance due to sedation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of mucopurulent secretions in the left mainstem bronchus. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications.
3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The patient has an incurable squamous cell carcinoma of the face, which required"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma of the right cheek, which required nasal intubation and multiple packed red blood cell transfusions.
- The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and has a history of not wanting aggressive medical interventions, but agreed to intubation for embolization.
- The patient underwent embolization of the sphenopalatine artery, and the bleeding has stopped.
- Unfortunately, the patient developed a mucous plug in the left mainstem bronchus, leading to the production of lots of mucopurulent secretions. A bronchoscopy was performed, and the patient was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam empiric coverage.
- A family meeting was held, and it was decided to continue intubation to see if the secretions decrease in the next few days. If not, extubation will be readdressed.
- The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells due to a declining hematocrit.
- Allergies include morphine, with a reported rash.
- The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl and propofol, as well as other ICU medications.
- Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right cheek squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), who underwent a procedure involving internal radiation (IR) embolization of the sphenopalatine artery. The patient was intubated for the procedure and is now unable to be extubated. The patient has a history of SCC, with no surgical options available. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA), and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There are concerns about impaired airway protection due to the inability to cough and clear secretions. The patient's skin integrity is at risk due to immobility and pressure ulcers. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, and a slightly low platelet count. The patient also has right upper extremity swelling, which may indicate deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient's care plan includes continued intubation to assess improvement in secretions, close monitoring for any signs of bleeding from the SCC, and management of potential complications such as DVT. 

Medical Complications:
1. Impaired airway protection: The patient's inability to cough and clear secretions puts him at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
2. Impaired skin integrity: Immobility and pressure can lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
3. Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium levels may be indicative of malignancy.
4. Right upper extremity swelling: This could indicate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-inch tall male with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and septic shock. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine and a rash. He has received transfusions of packed red blood cells and has experienced multiple desaturations while on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition was stable until today when there were attempts to wean him off the ventilator, resulting in desaturation to 84%. A family meeting is scheduled for further discussion.

Medical Complications:
1. Risk for aspiration due to inability to protect airway.
2. Impaired skin integrity.
3. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), specific type not mentioned.
4. Hypotension and septic shock.
5. Potential complications related to mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.
7. Risk for stress ulcer due to critical illness and ICU stay.
8. Glycemic control management.
9. Nutritional support through enteral feeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o M with large R face SCC s/p hemorrhage from facial mass.
   1) Ventilator-associated pneumonia:  Patient electively underwent
   nasotracheal intubation in preparation for facial embolization
   procedure, now intubated >7 days with difficulty weaning from vent.
   Patient sustained left lung collapse on [**2-12**] with subsequent
   bronchoscopy that revealed thick, copious secretions.  Secretions
   continue to limit ventilator independence.   Currently he is on
   vancomycin/zosyn (day #5 of 8) for VAP (start date [**3-15**]).
   - Continue conversation with family regarding transition to comfort
   care if he fails extubation.
   - Pulmonary toilet
   - cont standing mucolytics
   - f/u BAL fluid culture
   - propofol and fentanyl gtt for sedation
   2) Facial mass:  Patient has large fungating unresectable SCC mass s/p
   brisk bleed to hematocrit of ~6.  He has been transfusion-dependent.
   ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection of mass as
   therapeutic option given involvement of skull margins.  Now s/p
   bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.
   -          Reconsult Neuro IR as needed for facial artery embolization
   -          Dressing changes daily, as per ENT recs
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 25 if bleeding, 21-24 if not
   bleeding significantly
   -          RadOnc to evaluate for palliative radiation once patient is
   able to participate in decision making ([**Pager number 4404**])
   -          Heme/Onc following
   -          Palliative Care following
   3)   Wound infection:  Facial mass with culture data from OSH positive
   for acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA.   He was previously
   treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, now covered with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   4)  Leukocytosis:  Likely leukemoid reaction vs. infection.
   - continue to trend
   5) Hypercalcemia:  Likely secondary a paraneoplastic process as humoral
   hypercalcemia of malignancy by secretion of PTHrP is commonly seen in
   squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
   - IV hydration
   - trend Ca
   6) RUE edema: Suspected superficial thrombophlebibis vs. upper
   extremity DVT.  Patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation under
   any circumstances, given facial hemorrhage; thus, no further work-up at
   this time to evaluate for clot.
   - Supportive care with arm elevation, warm compresses, removal of PIV
   7) FEN:
   - cont tube feeds
   8) PPx: pneumoboots, PPI
   9) CODE: DNR.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial skin cancer (SCC) who underwent nasotracheal intubation for a facial embolization procedure. He has been intubated for over 7 days and has difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient also has a history of left lung collapse on [**2-12**] with subsequent bronchoscopy revealing thick, copious secretions. Currently, he is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which started on [**3-15**].

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. Firstly, there is a facial mass that resulted in a brisk bleed to a hematocrit level of approximately 6. The patient is now dependent on transfusions to maintain a hematocrit level above 25 if bleeding or 21-24 if not bleeding significantly. ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection of the mass as a therapeutic option due to involvement of skull margins. The patient has undergone bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.

Secondly, the patient has a wound infection at the site of the facial mass, which was previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin. Currently, he is being covered with Vanc/Zosyn.

Thirdly, the patient has leukocytosis, which could be a leukemoid reaction or an infection. It is being monitored closely"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o M with large R face SCC s/p hemorrhage from facial mass.
   1) Ventilator-associated pneumonia:  Patient electively underwent
   nasotracheal intubation in preparation for facial embolization
   procedure, now intubated >7 days with difficulty weaning from vent.
   Patient sustained left lung collapse on [**2-12**] with subsequent
   bronchoscopy that revealed thick, copious secretions.  Secretions
   continue to limit ventilator independence.   Currently he is on
   vancomycin/zosyn (day #6 of 8) for VAP (start date [**3-15**]).
   - Continue conversation with family regarding transition to comfort
   care if he fails extubation.
   - Pulmonary toilet
   - cont standing mucolytics
   - f/u BAL fluid culture
   - propofol and fentanyl gtt for sedation
   2) Facial mass:  Patient has large fungating unresectable SCC mass s/p
   brisk bleed to hematocrit of ~6.  He has been transfusion-dependent.
   ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection of mass as
   therapeutic option given involvement of skull margins.  Now s/p
   bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.
   -          Reconsult Neuro IR as needed for facial artery embolization
   -          Dressing changes daily, as per ENT recs
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 25 if bleeding, 21-24 if not
   bleeding significantly
   -          RadOnc to evaluate for palliative radiation once patient is
   able to participate in decision making ([**Pager number 4404**])
   -          Heme/Onc following
   -          Palliative Care following
   3)   Wound infection:  Facial mass with culture data from OSH positive
   for acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA.   He was previously
   treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, now covered with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   4)  Leukocytosis:  Likely leukemoid reaction vs. infection.
   - continue to trend
   5) Hypercalcemia:  Likely secondary a paraneoplastic process as humoral
   hypercalcemia of malignancy by secretion of PTHrP is commonly seen in
   squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
   - IV hydration
   - trend Ca
   6) RUE edema: Suspected superficial thrombophlebibis vs. upper
   extremity DVT.  Patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation under
   any circumstances, given facial hemorrhage; thus, no further work-up at
   this time to evaluate for clot.
   - Supportive care with arm elevation, warm compresses, removal of PIV
   7) FEN:
   - cont tube feeds
   8) PPx: pneumoboots, PPI
   9) CODE: DNR.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who underwent nasal intubation for a facial embolization procedure. He has been on mechanical ventilation for over 7 days and has difficulty weaning off the ventilator. The patient had a left lung collapse on [**2-12**] with thick, copious secretions that limited ventilator independence. He is currently on vancomycin and zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which started on [**3-15**].

The patient also has a large fungating unresectable SCC mass with a brisk bleed to hematocrit of ~6. He has been transfusion-dependent and has undergone bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR. The facial mass culture was positive for Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA. He was previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin and is now covered with Vanc/Zosyn.

The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to a leukemoid reaction or infection. He also has hypercalcemia, which is suspected to be secondary to a paraneoplastic process as humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is commonly seen in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. They are currently admitted to the ICU and are on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode. The patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and leukocytosis. They also have impaired skin integrity, a history of cancer, and potential respiratory infections. The patient's vital signs show fluctuations in temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. There is concern for possible aspiration, impaired airway clearance, and cough. The patient has a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in their right upper extremity due to swelling. They are not a candidate for anticoagulation. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and they are currently receiving nutrition through a feeding tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) vs. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has secretions from the endotracheal tube, which can increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers or infections.
3. Cancer: The patient has a history of cancer, which may weaken their immune system and increase the risk of infections.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, although there have been episodes of desaturation. They have received blood products and are being treated with antibiotics for suspected infections. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and platelet count. They also have abnormal kidney function and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's skin integrity is compromised, and there is a concern for potential deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and the use of an endotracheal tube. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and secretion management is crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient may have a DVT in the right upper extremity, as indicated by swelling. Anticoagulation therapy may be considered if the patient's condition improves and they become a candidate for it.
3. Wound infection: The patient has compromised skin integrity, which increases the risk of wound infection. Appropriate wound care and antibiotic therapy are necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be a response to infection or inflammation. Monitoring for signs of infection and"

   trach and prolonged ventilator support given his underlying condition.
   Held discussion with patient as well and ultimately extubated the
   patient.  After extubation, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1068**] held long discussion with the
   patient in which he ultimately changed his code status to DNR/DNI which
   is reasonable given the circumstance of his disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large, incurable squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was intubated for a procedure but remains intubated due to pneumonia and inability to wean from the ventilator. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (T 101), pulse rate of 79 beats per minute (P 79), blood pressure of 118/56 mmHg (BP 118/56), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (RR 20), and oxygen saturation of 94% (Sat 94%). On examination, the patient has a large right-sided facial tumor, endotracheal tube in place, clear breath sounds, and no evidence of edema. The patient is awake and alert.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Respiratory Failure
2) Pneumonia
3) Squamous Cell Carcinoma (incurable)

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. ventilator-associated events (VAEs): These include conditions such as ventilator-associated conditions (VAC), infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVAC), and possible or probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's right upper extremity swelling may indicate a potential DVT.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o M with large R face SCC s/p hemorrhage from facial mass.
   1) Ventilator-associated pneumonia:  Patient electively underwent
   nasotracheal intubation in preparation for facial embolization
   procedure, now intubated >7 days with difficulty weaning from vent.
   Patient sustained left lung collapse on [**2-12**] with subsequent
   bronchoscopy that revealed thick, copious secretions.  Secretions
   continue to limit ventilator independence.   Currently he is on
   vancomycin/zosyn (day #6 of 8) for VAP (start date [**3-15**]).
   - Continue conversation with family regarding transition to comfort
   care if he fails extubation.
   - Pulmonary toilet
   - cont standing mucolytics
   - f/u BAL fluid culture
   - propofol and fentanyl gtt for sedation
    2) Facial mass:  Patient has large fungating unresectable SCC mass s/p
   brisk bleed to hematocrit of ~6.  He has been transfusion-dependent.
   ENT consultants have ruled out surgical resection of mass as
   therapeutic option given involvement of skull margins.  Now s/p
   bilateral sphenopalatine artery embolization by Neuro IR.
   -          Reconsult Neuro IR as needed for facial artery embolization
   -          Dressing changes daily, as per ENT recs
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 25 if bleeding, 21-24 if not
   bleeding significantly
   -          RadOnc to evaluate for palliative radiation once patient is
   able to participate in decision making ([**Pager number 4404**])
   -          Heme/Onc following
   -          Palliative Care following
   3)   Wound infection:  Facial mass with culture data from OSH positive
   for acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA.   He was previously
   treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, now covered with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   4)  Leukocytosis:  Likely leukemoid reaction vs. infection.
   - continue to trend
   5) Hypercalcemia:  Likely secondary a paraneoplastic process as humoral
   hypercalcemia of malignancy by secretion of PTHrP is commonly seen in
   squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
   - IV hydration
   - trend Ca
   6) RUE edema: Suspected superficial thrombophlebibis vs. upper
   extremity DVT.  Patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation under
   any circumstances, given facial hemorrhage; thus, no further work-up at
   this time to evaluate for clot.
   - Supportive care with arm elevation, warm compresses, removal of PIV
    7) FEN:
   - cont tube feeds
    8) PPx: pneumoboots, PPI
   9) CODE: DNR.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large right facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who has been admitted to the ICU. He underwent a facial embolization procedure and was subsequently intubated. The patient has difficulty weaning from the ventilator and has experienced multiple complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), facial mass bleeding, wound infection, leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, and right upper extremity edema. The patient's condition remains unstable, and the medical team is considering transitioning to comfort care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for more than 7 days and is having difficulty weaning from the ventilator. He also had a left lung collapse previously, which suggests an increased risk for VAP. The patient is currently on vancomycin and zosyn for this condition.
2. Facial mass bleeding: The patient's facial SCC has caused a brisk bleed, leading to a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. He has been transfusion-dependent and requires close monitoring for any signs of bleeding.
3. Wound infection: The patient's facial mass is infected with Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He has been previously treated with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, and now he is being covered with vancom"
