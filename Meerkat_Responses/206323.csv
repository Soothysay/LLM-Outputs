   agitation over past week in the setting of not sleeping.  medication
   changes include attempts to increase risperdal to 7.5mg tid without
   apparent benefit.  at present, he is calm.  alert to voice, but unable
   to answer questions given his current mode of ventilation.  labs
   notable for mild leukocytosis.  UA with few bacteria only.  DDx most
   likely is occult infection versus medication effect.  ECG without acute
   changes.  No obvious PNA on CXR, but cannot exclude lower lobe
   process.  Will proceed as follows:
   - f/u blood, urine, foot wound cultures.
   - f/u final read of CXR.
   - repeat stool cultures for c. diff.
   - minimize sedating medications, maintain sleep/wake cycle, treat
   constipation, urinary retention prn.
   - add-on ESR/CRP to r/o osteomyelitis, and f/u foot XRAY, though feel
   unlikely.
   - considered LP, but think bacterial meningitis seems less likely
   presently given time course, and presentation, however, he is on
   chronic steroid therapy. If no improvement, can re-consider.
   - continue po vancomycin for now, obtain culture data from NH if
   available, repeat stool cultures here, and d/c if no evidence of cdiff.
   - add-on LFTs.
   - start Vanc IV for cellulitis

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted from a nursing home with fevers, agitation, and right foot erythema.
- The patient has been experiencing increased agitation and fevers over the past week.
- On examination, the patient is alert but unable to answer questions due to his current mode of ventilation.
- The patient's labs show mild leukocytosis, and urinalysis with few bacteria.
- The differential diagnosis includes occult infection versus medication effect.
- The patient's ECG is normal, and there are no obvious pneumonia findings on chest X-ray, but a lower lobe process cannot be excluded.
- The plan includes following up with blood, urine, and foot wound cultures, repeating stool cultures for C. diff, minimizing sedating medications, treating constipation and urinary retention as needed, and considering a lumbar puncture if no improvement is seen.
- The patient is on chronic steroid therapy, and if bacterial meningitis is still suspected, a repeat consideration for LP can be made.
- The patient's hypotension is being monitored and managed with fluid boluses.
- The patient's COPD is being treated with home regimen of prednisone and inhalers, and weaning from mechanical ventilation as tolerated.
- The patient has a right ulnar/humerus fracture, and pain control is being continued per home regimen.
- The patient has a history of possible seizure during the last admission, and keppra is being continued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted from a nursing home with fevers, agitation, and right foot erythema. He has been experiencing altered mental status, increased agitation, and difficulty sleeping over the past week. Medication changes include attempts to increase risperdal to 7.5mg tid without apparent benefit. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 79/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Occult infection: The patient's altered mental status and fevers could be indicative of an underlying infection, which needs to be further investigated.
2. Medication effect: The patient's mental status changes may be attributed to medication effects, especially considering recent changes in his medication regimen.
3. Pneumonia: Although the chest X-ray does not show obvious pneumonia, there is a possibility of a lower lobe process that needs to be ruled out.
4. Osteomyelitis: The presence of mild erythema at the ankles and right lower extremity foot, along with leukocytosis, raises concern for possible osteomyelitis, particularly in the setting of chronic steroid therapy.
5. Chronic steroid therapy: The patient's chronic steroid use may contribute to his"

   changes include attempts to increase risperdal to 7.5mg tid without
   apparent benefit.  at present, he is calm.  alert to voice, but unable
   to answer questions given his current mode of ventilation.  labs
   notable for mild leukocytosis.  UA with few bacteria only.  DDx most
   likely is occult infection versus medication effect.  ECG without acute
   changes.  No obvious PNA on CXR, but cannot exclude lower lobe process.
    Will proceed as follows:
   - f/u blood, urine, foot wound cultures.
   - f/u final read of CXR.
   - repeat stool cultures for c. diff.
   - minimize sedating medications, maintain sleep/wake cycle, treat
   constipation, urinary retention prn.
   - add-on ESR/CRP to r/o osteomyelitis, and f/u foot XRAY, though feel
   unlikely.
   - considered LP, but think bacterial meningitis seems less likely
   presently given time course, and presentation, however, he is on
   chronic steroid therapy. If no improvement, can re-consider.
   - continue po vancomycin for now, obtain culture data from NH if
   available, repeat stool cultures here, and d/c if no evidence of cdiff.
   - add-on LFTs.
   - start Vanc IV for cellulitis

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted from a nursing home with fevers, agitation, and right foot erythema. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic back pain, anxiety, agitation, COPD, right ulnar/humerus fracture, and diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status, nausea/vomiting, hypotension, and a possible infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension raises concerns for septic shock, which is a life-threatening complication of an infection.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has erythema on his right foot, which could indicate cellulitis, a bacterial infection of the skin and tissues beneath the skin.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient is on vancomycin for suspected C. difficile infection, which is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's increased agitation and lack of improvement despite treatment suggest the possibility of pneumonia, especially considering his history of COPD.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on fondaparinux for DVT prophylaxis, indicating a risk of blood clot formation in the deep veins.
6. Medication Reactions: Given the patient's history of allergies to various medications, there is a"

   - pt's HCT dropped today (24 -> 17, repeated 19), resulting in the
   patient being transfused 2U PRBCs with post-transfusion HCT of 31;
   Given this increase, it is likely that the 17 and 19 HCTs were falsely
   low. CT abd was ordered to evaluate for any site of occult bleeding.

   agitation over past week in the setting of not sleeping.  medication
   changes include attempts to increase risperdal to 7.5mg tid without
   apparent benefit.  at present, he is calm.  alert to voice, but unable
   to answer questions given his current mode of ventilation.  labs
   notable for mild leukocytosis.  UA with few bacteria only.  DDx most
   likely is occult infection versus medication effect.  ECG without acute
   changes.  No obvious PNA on CXR, but cannot exclude lower lobe
   process.  Likely mental status changes [**2-11**] hypotension, as patient
   mental status significantly improved with increased blood pressure.  No
   osteomyelitis.
   - start Vanc IV for cellulitis x5d
   - continue po vancomycin for now until C. diff results back
   - f/u blood, urine, foot wound cultures.
   - minimize sedating medications, maintain sleep/wake cycle, treat
   constipation, urinary retention prn.
   - Avoid Haldol for agitation

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of recent PEA arrest, tracheomalacia, chronic ventilator dependence, admitted from Hospital 12 rehab with fevers, agitation, hypotension, and right foot erythema. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of somnolence and arousal. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's recent medical history includes COPD, a possible seizure, diabetes mellitus type 2, anxiety, depression, multiple fractures, chronic low back pain, and diastolic congestive heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been changing over the past week, with increased agitation and fluctuating levels of alertness. This could be due to an occult infection or medication effects. The patient's mental status significantly improved with increased blood pressure, suggesting a possible hypotension-related cause.

2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which have improved following subclavian line placement. This indicates a potential issue with the patient's vascular access or response to fluid resuscitation.

3. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient experienced episodes of emesis overnight, which may be due to slow gastric emptying or gag reflex during suctioning. Tube feeds should be cautiously reintroduced, and medications to increase gastric motility should be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of recent PEA arrest, tracheomalacia, chronic ventilator dependence, admitted from Hospital 12 Rehab with fevers, agitation, hypotension, and right foot erythema. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, referred to as delirium, and has been on various medications including risperdal, olanzapine, and haloperidol. The patient's mental status has significantly improved with increased blood pressure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status - likely due to occult infection versus medication effect. The patient's mental status has improved with increased blood pressure, so it is likely related to hypotension.
2. Nausea/vomiting - treated with famotidine.
3. Hypotension - resolved after subclavian line placement without need for Neosynephrine. Monitoring daily HCTs and considering management with fluid boluses.
4. Right foot erythema - diagnosed as cellulitis, started Vanc IV for 5 days, continue po vancomycin, repeat stool cultures for C. diff, obtain culture data from Hospital 12 Rehab, and discontinue if no evidence of C. diff.
5. Mental status changes - minimized sedating medications, maintained sleep/wake cycle, treated constipation, urinary retention prn, considered LP but less likely given time course and presentation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of being admitted to the MICU multiple times, most recently for fevers, agitation, and hypotension in the setting of a right foot lesion (I&D in ED). The patient has had a prolonged post-arrest course in [Month] and [Month] of this year.

The patient's current conditions include septic shock, anemia, and respiratory failure. The septic shock appears to have resolved, and the patient is being continued on vancomycin for foot cellulitis for five days and has discontinued stress dose steroids. The anemia is now stable with a Hct that is stable.

The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation in the mode of MMV (mandatory minute volume). When switched to PSV (pressure support ventilation), the patient takes minimal tidal volumes, consistent with significant chronic respiratory muscle weakness.

The patient is not tolerating tube feeds at the moment and has been given Reglan (metoclopramide) as needed. Other issues are being managed by the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Infection: The patient's history of septic shock and ongoing treatment with vancomycin indicate a risk for further infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or worsening respiratory status, would be important.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's chronic respiratory"

   # Altered mental status - referred to [**Hospital1 54**] [**2-11**] fevers and increased
   agitation over past week in the setting of not sleeping.  medication
   changes include attempts to increase risperdal to 7.5mg tid without
   apparent benefit.  at present, he is calm.  alert to voice, but unable
   to answer questions given his current mode of ventilation.  labs
   notable for mild leukocytosis.  UA with few bacteria only.  DDx most
   likely is occult infection versus medication effect.  ECG without acute
   changes.  No obvious PNA on CXR, but cannot exclude lower lobe
   process.  Likely mental status changes [**2-11**] hypotension, as patient
   mental status significantly improved with increased blood pressure.  No
   osteomyelitis.
   - start Vanc IV for cellulitis x5d
   - continue po vancomycin for now until C. diff results back
   - f/u blood, urine, foot wound cultures.
   - minimize sedating medications, maintain sleep/wake cycle, treat
   constipation, urinary retention prn.
   - Avoid Haldol for agitation
   .
   #Hypotension:  Improved following subclavian line placement without
   need for Neosynephrine.  Currently resolved.
   - pt
s cortisol 2.1 this AM
started IV Hydrocortisone [**12-21**] for
   adrenal insufficiency; switch to home dose for now and recommend slowly
   titrating off home steroids for COPD on discharge
   .
   # Emesis:  Likely [**2-11**] slow gastric emptying given nausea and subsequent
   emesis with tube feeds.  Also likely [**2-11**] gag reflex given one episode
   was during suctioning.
   - Cautious re-initiation of tube feeds today
   - Reglan for nausea and to increase gastric motility
   - Fluids as necessary if patient has large volume losses with repeated
   emesis
   .
   # COPD - s/p trach - continue home regimen of prednisone, and
   inhalers.
   - wean MMV as tolerated, seems to be on this now more [**2-11**] mental status
   rather than oxygenation.  Was on [**10-14**] of PS at prior discharge.
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis, calcium, vitamin d.
   .
   # right ulnar/humerus fracture - continue pain control per home regimen
   (tylenol, fentanyl patch, klonopin), calcium, vitamin d.  elbow brace
   recently removed.

   # h/o ?seizure - during last admission, seen by neurology, and felt to
   have clinical seizures although his EEG WNL.
   - continue keppra.

   # diastolic CHF - clinically euvolemic, though ?pleural effusions on
   CXR are new.
   - follow-up final read CXR.

   # anxiety/agitation - for now will continue regimen of olanzapine, but
   will reduce to 5mg po tid for agitation, continue klonopin, and
   consider discussing with psych in AM if agitation remains an issue.
   Also, per nursing, likely significant component of depression given
   patient is withdrawn and non-interactive with what appears to be
   depressed mood.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of recent PEA arrest, tracheomalacia, chronic ventilator dependence, admitted from a rehabilitation hospital with fevers, agitation, hypotension, and right foot erythema. The patient has multiple medical conditions including altered mental status, hypotension, nausea/vomiting, COPD, right ulnar/humerus fracture, h/o possible seizure, diabetes mellitus type 2, diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic low back pain, anxiety/agitation, metabolic alkalosis, leukocytosis, and a code status of full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and medical history include:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers, agitation, and erythema on the right foot. These symptoms may indicate an underlying infection, such as cellulitis or a urinary tract infection.

2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension can be a concern for inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure to prevent complications such as shock.

3. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's ongoing nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and poor nutrition. Appropriate management strategies, including antiemetic medications and cautious reintroduction of tube feeds, should be implemented.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of recent PEA arrest, tracheomalacia, chronic ventilator dependence, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation hospital with fevers, agitation, hypotension, and right foot erythema. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, nausea/vomiting, and hypotension. He also has a history of pain control issues, chronic respiratory failure, and possible adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, ranging from somnolent but arousable to non-interactive. This could be due to occult infection, medication effects, or other underlying causes. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and further investigation for possible infections or other contributing factors are necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, which have improved following subclavian line placement. It is important to continue monitoring his blood pressure and ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation if needed. The underlying cause of his hypotension should be investigated further.

3. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to slow gastric emptying, gag reflex, anxiety, depression, or medication side effects. Careful reintroduction of tube feeds and management of nausea with medications like Reglan and Ativan should be considered.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Altered mental status - The patient has been experiencing increased agitation and altered mental status over the past week. This could be due to an occult infection or medication effect. The patient's mental status significantly improved with increased blood pressure, suggesting that hypotension may have contributed to the altered mental status. The patient's cortisol level was low, indicating adrenal insufficiency. The patient was started on IV hydrocortisone and will be switched to home dose for now, with a recommendation to slowly titrate off home steroids for COPD on discharge.

2. Hypotension - The patient had hypotension that improved following subclavian line placement without the need for Neosynephrine. The patient's blood pressure is currently resolved.

3. Emesis - The patient has been experiencing emesis, which is likely due to slow gastric emptying or gag reflex during suctioning. The patient's tube feeds will be cautiously re-initiated today, and Reglan will be given for nausea and to increase gastric motility.

4. COPD - The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently on home regimen of prednisone and inhalers. The patient's tracheostomy will be weaned off mechanical ventilation as tolerated, and the patient will be transitioned back to home regimen of COPD treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man who has a history of a previous cardiac arrest and was readmitted to the MICU with fevers, agitation, and hypotension due to a foot lesion that required incision and drainage. The patient's current conditions include septic shock, anemia, and respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications including vancomycin for cellulitis, morphine sulfate, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, which indicates a severe infection. It is important to closely monitor his vital signs and lab results for any signs of worsening infection or development of new infections.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications. Maintaining proper hydration, elevating the head of bed, and performing regular mouth care can help prevent VAP.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient has hypotension, which may indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with fluids and vasopressors are necessary to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulcers or aspiration pneumonia. Prophylactic medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can be given to"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted from [Hospital 12] Rehab with fevers, agitation, hypotension, and right foot erythema. The patient has a history of pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), respiratory failure (chronic), nausea/vomiting, hypotension (not shock), and altered mental status (not delirium).

The patient's current mental status is somnolent but arousable, non-interactive, and NAD. The CV examination reveals regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen shows stable, non-tender, nondistended, and bowel sounds present. The extremities show improved right lower extremity with bandage, cool/dry/insensitive, no pedal edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.0 (normal range: 4.5-11.0 x 10^9/L). The Hct level is 25.5 (normal range: 37-49%). The platelet count is 421 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L). The creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL). The glucose level is 93 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL). The sodium level is 141 mEq/L (normal range: 135-145 mEq/L). The potassium level is 4.4 mg/dL (normal range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L). The chloride level is 100 mEq/L (normal range: 96-106 mEq/L). The magnesium level is 1.8 mg/dL (normal range: 1.7-2.2 mg/dL). The phosphate level is 8 mg/dL (normal range: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL).

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, likely due to occult infection versus medication effect. Hypotension has improved following subclavian line placement without the need for Neosynephrine. Nausea/vomiting is likely due to slow gastric emptying and gag reflex, as well as significant anxiety and depression. Anxiety/agitation may be a component of depression given the patient's withdrawn and non-interactive behavior. COPD is being managed with home regimen of prednisone and inhalers. Right ulnar/humerus fracture pain control is being managed per home regimen (Tylenol, fentanyl patch, Klonopin), calcium, and vitamin D. The patient has a history of possible seizure during last admission, seen by neurology, and felt to have clinical seizures although his EEG was normal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could indicate an underlying infection. C. diff negative x2, but further evaluation is needed for infectious causes.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient started IV hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency and will switch to home dose PO Prednisone.
3. Nausea/vomiting: The patient may experience nausea and vomiting due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of PEA arrest, tracheomalacia, chronic ventilator dependence, admitted from [Hospital 12] Rehab with fevers, agitation, hypotension, and right foot erythema. He is currently on multiple medications including risperdal, olanzapine, klonopin, celexa, tramadol, lidocaine patch, standing tylenol, bactrim prophylaxis, calcium, vitamin d, keppra, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and fondaparinux.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status - The patient has been experiencing increased agitation and fevers over the past week. His mental status is significantly improved with increased blood pressure. No obvious pneumonia on chest x-ray, but cannot exclude lower lobe process. Occult infection versus medication effect is the differential diagnosis. ECG without acute changes. Mild leukocytosis is noted in labs.

2. Hypotension - Improved following subclavian line placement without need for Neosynephrine. Currently resolved. The patient's cortisol AM 2.1 and started IV Hydrocortisone on [12-21] for adrenal insufficiency; switch to home dose po Prednisone for now and recommend slowly titrating off home steroids for COPD on discharge.

   to answer questions given his current mode of ventilation.  labs
   notable for mild leukocytosis.  UA with few bacteria only.  DDx most
   likely is occult infection versus medication effect.  ECG without acute
   changes.  No obvious PNA on CXR, but cannot exclude lower lobe
   process.  Likely mental status changes [**2-11**] hypotension, as patient
   mental status significantly improved with increased blood pressure.  No
   osteomyelitis on xray of right foot; improving LE erythema.

   # Nausea/Emesis:  Likely [**2-11**] slow gastric emptying given nausea and
   subsequent emesis with tube feeds.  Also likely [**2-11**] gag reflex given
   one episode was during suctioning.  Also contributing is his
   significant anxiety and depression
   - re-initiation of tube feeds yesterday

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications and potential issues include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient has been experiencing increased agitation and altered mental status over the past week. This could be due to an occult infection or medication effects. The patient's mental status significantly improved with increased blood pressure.

2. Hypotension: The patient had episodes of hypotension, which have improved following subclavian line placement. The cause of hypotension may be related to adrenal insufficiency, as the patient's cortisol level was low. The patient started IV hydrocortisone and is recommended to switch to home dose of prednisone and slowly titrate off home steroids for COPD on discharge.

3. Nausea/Emesis: The patient likely has slow gastric emptying, contributing to nausea and subsequent emesis with tube feeds. Other factors such as gag reflex, anxiety, and depression may also contribute to his symptoms. The patient is on standing Reglan, Zofran prn, and fluids as necessary if he has large volume losses with repeated emesis.

4. Anxiety/Agitation: The patient has ongoing anxiety and agitation. Olanzapine has been reduced to 5mg po tid for agitation. Klonopin is continued, and consideration is being given to discussing with psych in AM if agitation remains an issue. Celexa 20mg is started for depression.

5. COPD: The patient has chronic obstructive"
