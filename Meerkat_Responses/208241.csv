 BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.
   Streptococcus species most likely to be involved include viridans
   streptococci, Streptococcus milleri, microaerophilic streptococci and
   Streptococcus pneumoniae. Seems less likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis
   given negative TEE today. Other possible sources include paranasal
   sinuses, lungs or GI tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid
   collection at hilum of spleen seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's
   chief complaint abd pain. Must also consider sinuses though per husband
   pt not complaining of sinus pain nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Currently on ABX coverage with Vancomycin given PCN allergy.
   - Plan is to initiate PCN desensitization tonight so that PCN 4 million
   units Q4 hrs can be initiated
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Per Neurosurg plan is for repeat Head CT in 4 weeks
   - F/U ID recs
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Phenytoin level this morning therapeutic
   - Pt bolused another 800mg dilantin yesterday and dilantin dose
   increased to 100/200/200mg, Keppra increased to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **] and
   midazolam gtt increased to 0.25mg/kg/hour
   - Continous EEG monitoring
   - f/u neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. IR feels this
   is a chronic collection and is not in favor of percutaneous drainage.
   - discuss with general surgery
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## PCN Allergy: Plan for PCN desensitization per allergy protocol.
   Risks and benefits discussed with patient's husband who understands
   risks and benefits of desensitization.
   - Desensitization protocol completed without incident.
   - First dose penicillin to be given this morning.
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.45/43/105
   - continue current settings for now
   - CXR in am -
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV dilt and IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, bovine aortic valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia. She was found to have a left parietal brain abscess, which has been drained. The patient also experienced seizures.
- The patient has a known penicillin allergy and is currently on antibiotics coverage with vancomycin. Penicillin desensitization is planned to initiate tonight so that penicillin can be initiated.
- The patient has a new multiloculated subdural collection on MRI, which requires further evaluation and possible drainage.
- The patient's fever is ongoing, and cultures are positive for Streptococcus species. There is suspicion of a gastrointestinal tract source given fluid collection at the hilum of the spleen seen on CT. The patient also complains of abdominal pain.
- The patient has been on continuous EEG monitoring, and her seizures are well-controlled with phenytoin, dilantin, keppra, and midazolam.
- There is a fluid collection in the splenic hilum, which is suspicious for a focus of infection. However, interventional radiology does not recommend percutaneous drainage due to it being a chronic collection.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is well-controlled, and she is currently in sinus rhythm.
- The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with"

 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.
   Streptococcus species most likely to be involved include viridans
   streptococci, Streptococcus milleri, microaerophilic streptococci and
   Streptococcus pneumoniae. Seems less likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis
   given negative TEE today. Other possible sources include paranasal
   sinuses, lungs or GI tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid
   collection at hilum of spleen seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's
   chief complaint abd pain. Must also consider sinuses though per husband
   pt not complaining of sinus pain nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Being transitioned to PCN (off vancomycin) after successful
   desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Per Neurosurg plan is for repeat Head CT in 4 weeks; will clarify if
   no further instrumentation for loculated area
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Phenytoin level this morning therapeutic
   - Pt bolused another 800mg dilantin yesterday and dilantin dose
   increased to 100/200/200mg, Keppra increased to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **] and
   midazolam gtt increased to 0.25mg/kg/hour
   - Continous EEG monitoring
   - Appreciate neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. IR feels this
   is a chronic collection and is not in favor of percutaneous drainage.
   - discuss with general surgery
   -will confirm that OK to have OGT
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID regs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## PCN Allergy: Plan for PCN desensitization per allergy protocol.
   Risks and benefits discussed with patient's husband who understands
   risks and benefits of desensitization.
   - Desensitization protocol completed without incident.
   - To start PCN at therapeutic doses today
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.45/43/105
   - continue current settings for now; will attempt to wean sedatives and
   speak with neurology re: status for possible extubation tomorrow
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV dilt and IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, bovine aortic valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation who presented with right-sided weakness and progressive aphasia. She was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess, which was drained. The abscess cultures were positive for Streptococcus species, and a CT scan showed fluid collection at the hilum of the spleen. The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain. Other possible sources of infection include the paranasal sinuses, lungs, or gastrointestinal tract. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antiepileptics. She is also receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's blood cultures have shown persistent bacteremia with Streptococcus species. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain Abscess: The patient has already had a brain abscess that required drainage. There is a risk of recurrence or spread of infection to other areas of the brain.
2. Seizures: The patient has been experiencing focal motor seizures involving the right arm. It is important to continue seizure management and adjust medication doses as needed.
3. Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: The presence of fluid collection at the hilum of the spleen suggests a potential focus of infection, especially considering the patient's complaint of left upper quadrant pain"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Brain abscess: The patient has a brain abscess, which is a serious infection within the brain tissue. It requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics and may require surgical intervention.

2. Seizures: The patient has experienced seizures, which can be a result of the brain abscess. Managing seizures is crucial to prevent further brain damage and ensure the patient's safety.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The goal is to continue current ventilator management and aim for extubation if the patient's condition improves.

4. Splenic abscess: The patient also has a splenic abscess, which is an infection within the spleen. Antibiotic therapy and possibly surgical intervention may be necessary to treat this condition.

5. Potential anastomotic leak: There is a low suspicion of an anastomotic leak, which is a potential complication after surgical procedures. This should be discussed with the surgical team and may require further diagnostic imaging studies, such as a gastrograffin study.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and response to treatment. Regular communication between the medical team members is essential to ensure optimal care and address any emerging complications promptly."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a brain abscess, splenic abscess, fevers, and respiratory failure. She has been sedated and unable to provide a medical history. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including penicillin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. She is also receiving midazolam, metoprolol, hydromorphone, heparin, and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 550 mL, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 376. The blood cultures from September 3rd showed growth at 11:41 PM. Other lab results include elevated glucose levels, prolonged PT/PTT/increased INR, and abnormal liver function tests.

   -Spoke with surgery- had recommended gastrograffin study in the past to
   evaluate for leak, but was never done [**2-4**] respiratory status. Also
   asked about OGT, which they said would have to be done very carefully
   if done at bedside. Recommended IR placed Dophoff with concomminant
   gastrograffin study. Will need to speak with IR about this.
   -Got CRP (pending); ESR=150. ID had wanted these studies for baseline.
   Need to touch base about how long to continue antibiotics
   -Neurology said no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. Recommended
   decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin levels daily, and

   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Less
   likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE today. Other
   possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI tract.
   Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen seen
   on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain. Must also
   consider sinuses though per husband pt not complaining of sinus pain
   nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Now on PCN after successful desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   - MRI showed chronic sinusitis, but nothing acute - further imaging
   unlikely to add more information.
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin level this morning low - 12.8.  Neuro wants to maintain
   level at 20.  Will bolus for increased level.
   -Neuro recommendes decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin
   levels daily, and bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. Discussed with
   ID and general surgery.
   -discuss with IR, plan to place Dophoff with Gastrograffin study to
   evaluate bowel near splenic fluid collection, evaluate for possible
   source of infection, and also allow PO intake if possible.
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## PCN Allergy: Successful desensitization, now on standing PCN.
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.44/43/99
   - continue current settings for now; weaning sedatives as no new
   seizure activity, will continue to wean as tolerated and as recommended
   by neuro.
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV dilt and IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, bovine aortic valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation post-cardioversion. She presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia and was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess, which has been drained. She is experiencing seizures and has undergone desensitization for penicillin allergy. The patient also has a fluid collection in the hilum of her spleen, suspected to be a focus of infection, and chronic sinusitis. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with anemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. Her blood glucose levels are being monitored, and she is receiving prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient is experiencing focal motor seizures involving the right arm. Despite loading with dilantin and keppra, continuous seizure activity persisted until the evening of 9/2. EEG monitoring showed no evidence of seizure activity, so the neurologist recommends decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour and maintaining dilantin levels at 20.

2. Brain Abscess: The patient had a left-sided parietal abscess that was evacuated. Cultures from the abscess confirmed Streptococcus infection. There is a suspicion of other possible sources of infection such as the gastrointestinal tract or"

   gastrograffin study. Will need to speak with IR about this.
   -Got CRP (pending); ESR=150. ID had wanted these studies for baseline.
   Need to touch base about how long to continue antibiotics
   -Neurology said no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. Recommended
   decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin levels daily, and
   bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.

 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Less
   likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE today. Other
   possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI tract.
   Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen seen
   on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain. Must also
   consider sinuses though per husband pt not complaining of sinus pain
   nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Now on PCN after successful desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   - MRI showed chronic sinusitis, but nothing acute - further imaging
   unlikely to add more information.
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin level this morning low - 12.8.  Neuro wants to maintain
   level at 20.  Will bolus for increased level.
   -Neuro recommendes decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin
   levels daily, and bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. Discussed with
   ID and general surgery.
   -, plan to place Dophoff with Gastrograffin study to evaluate bowel
   near splenic fluid collection, evaluate for possible source of
   infection, and also allow PO intake if possible. Scheduled for tomorrow
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.44/43/99
   - continue current settings for now; weaning sedatives as no new
   seizure activity, will continue to wean as tolerated and as recommended
   by neuro.
   -talk to neurosurg re weaning sedation, try to wean from vent
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.
   .
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation (afib) who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia.
- She was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess which has been drained, leading to seizures.
- The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated prior to brain abscess drainage surgery.
- She remains stable on controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) and is likely to require intubation until seizures are well-controlled.
- The patient has anemia with a low hematocrit (HCT) level but it is stable, and will be monitored closely.
- She experienced atrial fibrillation post-cardioversion but has been in sinus rhythm since then.
- Her blood pressure is well-controlled with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
- The patient has a fever and has been on various antibiotics including vancomycin, fluconazole, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and penicillin G potassium.
- She has a history of marginal ulcer and a previous abscess, and an endoscopic gastrostomy (EGD) is recommended to evaluate for marginal ulcer/abscess.
- The patient has a fluid collection at the hilum of her spleen seen on CT, suspicious for a focus of infection.

   24 Hour Events:
   -Spoke with neurosurg- No further instrumentation; Needs Sutures
   removed on [**2143-9-10**] (POD #10, [**Doctor First Name **] was on [**2143-8-31**]). Needs repeat
   noncontrast CT head in 4 wks and f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1703**].
   -Page [**Numeric Identifier 5083**] when EEG leads removed to take off dressing
   -Radiology said has evidence of chronic sinus disease on MRI, and was
   visualized well, but nothing looks acute and not likely to gain further
   information on dedicated sinus CT.
   -Fluids- goal to be even (concern for DI), started IVF at 150cc/hr for
   2 liters at 2pm; at 2am was even.  FENa 1.39; got urine and serum
   osms...urine osm>500, serum osm 282
   -ID thinks source of fevers=perforated marginal ulcer vs. splenic fluid
   collection; recommended EGD to evaluate for marginal ulcer/abscess
   (which she has had in the past)
   -Spoke with surgery- had recommended gastrograffin study in the past to
   evaluate for leak, but was never done [**2-4**] respiratory status. Also
   asked about OGT, which they said would have to be done very carefully
   if done at bedside. Recommended IR placed Dophoff with concomminant
   gastrograffin study. Will need to speak with IR about this.
   -Got CRP (pending); ESR=150. ID had wanted these studies for baseline.
   Need to touch base about how long to continue antibiotics
   -Neurology said no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. Recommended
   decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin levels daily, and

 BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Less
   likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE today. Other
   possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI tract.
   Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen seen
   on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain. Must also
   consider sinuses though per husband pt not complaining of sinus pain
   nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Now on PCN after successful desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   - MRI showed chronic sinusitis, but nothing acute - further imaging
   unlikely to add more information.
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin level this morning low - 12.8.  Neuro wants to maintain
   level at 20.  Will bolus for increased level.
   -Neuro recommendes decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin
   levels daily, and bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. Discussed with
   ID and general surgery.
   -, plan to place Dophoff with Gastrograffin study to evaluate bowel
   near splenic fluid collection, evaluate for possible source of
   infection, and also allow PO intake if possible. Scheduled for tomorrow
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.44/43/99
   - continue current settings for now; weaning sedatives as no new
   seizure activity, will continue to wean as tolerated and as recommended
   by neuro.
   -talk to neurosurg re weaning sedation, try to wean from vent
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.
   .
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.  Will try to place NGT today if study
   allows.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), bovine Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation post-cardioversion. She presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia and was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess that has been drained. The patient is experiencing seizures.

The patient's recent events include speaking with neurosurgery, who recommends no further instrumentation and needs sutures removed on September 10th. The patient also had an EEG when EEG leads were removed to take off the dressing. Radiology mentioned evidence of chronic sinus disease on MRI, but nothing acute was noted, and further imaging is unlikely to provide additional information.

Fluid balance is a concern, as the patient may have diabetes insipidus (DI), and IV fluids are being given to keep her even. The patient's fluid intake and output are being closely monitored. The FENa is 1.39, and urine osmolarity is greater than 500, while serum osmolarity is 282.

In terms of infection, the patient's source of fevers is believed to be a perforated marginal ulcer or splenic fluid collection. An endoscopy (EGD) has been recommended to evaluate for marginal ulcer/abscess, which she has had in the past. The patient also had a gastrograffin study in the past to evaluate"

 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed
   streptococcus.  Less likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE
   today. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - will repeat head CT today per neuro recs.
   - continue PCN s/p desentization
   - d/c fluconazole as cultures negative
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin 14.4, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - per neuro okay to d/c midaz
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   - fup surgery recs
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - give need for possible surgery, will not attempt to wean today.
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation (AFib) who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia.
- She was found to have a left-sided parietal brain abscess that has been drained, and her course has been complicated by seizures.
- The patient's blood cultures are positive for Streptococcus, and her wound cultures from the brain abscess confirmed the presence of Streptococcus as well.
- It is less likely that this is infective endocarditis given the negative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) today.
- Other possible sources of infection include the paranasal sinuses, lungs, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
- The patient is suspicious of a GI tract source due to a fluid collection at the hilum of the spleen seen on CT, as well as her chief complaint of abdominal pain.
- An MRI shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source, and the lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- The plan is to repeat a head CT today per neurology recommendations.
- The patient will continue with penicillin G potassium post desensitization, discontinue fluconazole as cultures are negative, follow up final abscess cultures and sensitivities, and continue with PCN s/p desensitization.
- Neurosurgery recommends no further intervention for now but will need sutures out on postoperative day (POD) #10.
- The patient has been experiencing focal motor seizures involving the right arm beginning on [**8-31**], which were recorded on EEG.
- At that time, she was loaded with dilantin and keppra.
- Despite adding midazolam continuous seizure activity persisted through [**9-2**].
- Keppra and Dilantin were continued to be titrated up, resulting in the cessation of continuous seizure activity beginning the evening of [**9-2**].
- Continuous EEG monitoring shows no evidence of seizure activity per neurology.
- Phenytoin levels are at 14.4, and it will be adjusted per neurology recommendations, with a goal level of 20.
- It is okay to discontinue midazolam.
- The patient will continue to follow neurology recommendations.
- The patient has a splenic hilum fluid collection, most likely due to anastomotic leak at her gastric jejunostomy.
- Further follow-up is recommended for the final read of the study, surgery recommendations, and continuing with flagyl and cipro for now, appreciating the ID recommendations.
- The patient remains stable on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
- She will likely require intubation at least until seizures are well-controlled.
- The patient's HCT is"

   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Less
   likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE today. Other
   possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI tract.
   Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen seen
   on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain. Must also
   consider sinuses though per husband pt not complaining of sinus pain
   nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Now on PCN after successful desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx return
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   - MRI showed chronic sinusitis, but nothing acute - further imaging
   unlikely to add more information.
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin level this morning low - 12.8.  Neuro wants to maintain
   level at 20.  Will bolus for increased level.
   -Neuro recommendes decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin
   levels daily, and bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. Discussed with
   ID and general surgery.
   -, plan to place Dophoff with Gastrograffin study to evaluate bowel
   near splenic fluid collection, evaluate for possible source of
   infection, and also allow PO intake if possible. Scheduled for tomorrow
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.44/43/99
   - continue current settings for now; weaning sedatives as no new
   seizure activity, will continue to wean as tolerated and as recommended
   by neuro.
   -talk to neurosurg re weaning sedation, try to wean from vent
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib) status post cardioversion, who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia. She was found to have a left-sided parietal brain abscess, which has been drained. The patient has experienced seizures and is currently on prophylactic anticonvulsant medication.

The patient has been diagnosed with a brain abscess, and cultures from the abscess confirmed the presence of Streptococcus. The MRI demonstrated interval improvement since the evacuation of the abscess. Other possible sources of infection include the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, given fluid collection at the hilum of the spleen seen on CT, as well as the paranasal sinuses. The patient's chief complaint includes abdominal pain, and further imaging is needed to evaluate these potential sources of infection.

The patient also has a history of anemia, with a low but stable hematocrit (HCT) level. She has been prescribed antibiotics, including penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. She is currently receiving IV fluids and has been intubated prior to going to the operating room for drainage of the brain abscess. The patient remains stable on controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV).

Additionally, the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was s/p cardioversion"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a brain abscess, seizures, and respiratory failure. They have been sedated and unable to provide their medical history. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving multiple antibiotics for the brain abscess. The patient's fever is ongoing, and further diagnostic tests including a gastrograffin study, EEG, and head CT are pending. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and codeine, and is currently receiving several medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, metoprolol, pantoprazole, heparin, dilantin, and others as per ICU resident note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures, and if not properly managed, there is a risk of recurrent seizures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the ventilatory support is not optimized or if there are complications related to the endotracheal tube or ventilation settings, it can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Infection spread: Brain abscesses can potentially spread to other parts of the body if not effectively treated. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis or new infection sites is necessary.
4. Medication reactions/allergic reactions: Given the patient's known allergies to penicillins and codeine, it is essential to be cautious when prescribing any medications from these"

","The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of brain abscess, splenic abscess, fevers, and respiratory failure. She is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has several medical allergies, including penicillins, codeine, and Keflex. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 110/65 to 130/69 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, metoprolol, pantoprazole, heparin, and dilantin. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her sodium, potassium, and chloride levels are within normal range. 

The patient's neurological exam reveals that she is attentive but does not follow simple commands and her movement, tone, and other neurological functions are not assessed. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, a tidal volume of 420-476 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 91.

   CT head shows increased size of subdural collection as well as small

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a brain abscess, splenic abscess, fevers, and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, codeine, and an unknown allergy with anaphylaxis. She has been receiving multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and penicillin G potassium. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide her own medical history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain Abscess: The presence of a brain abscess can lead to increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and neurological deficits.
2. Seizures: The patient has experienced seizures, which can be a complication of the brain abscess. It is important to continue seizure prophylaxis with medications such as levetiracetam, midazolam, and phenytoin.
3. Splenic Abscess: The presence of a splenic abscess can lead to continued infection and potentially rupture, causing internal bleeding.
4. Anastomotic Leak: The patient's recent surgery may have resulted"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation (afib) status post cardioversion. She presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia, leading to the discovery of a left-sided parietal abscess that has been drained. The patient has also had seizures and is currently being treated with antiepileptic drugs.

Medical Complications:
1. Brain Abscess: The patient had a brain abscess that was evacuated, and cultures confirmed the presence of Streptococcus. Additional sources of infection include the paranasal sinuses, lungs, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A fluid collection at the hilum of the spleen seen on CT suggests a possible GI tract source. An MRI showed chronic sinusitis as another potential source.
2. Seizures: The patient experienced focal motor seizures involving the right arm starting on August 31st. Despite loading with dilantin and keppra, seizure activity persisted until September 2nd. An EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity. Phenytoin was added, aiming for a goal level of 20.
3. Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: The patient likely has a leak at her gastric jejunostomy, which is causing fluid collection in the splenic hilum. A CT scan with IV and PO contrast is needed for further evaluation of per"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has safely extubated and remains quite alert and able to
   participate in simple tasks. She is moving her right side better too.
   Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] will advise regarding further interventions upon review of her
   abd CT scans. TPN will be initiated until GI issues sorted out. She may
   need IR drainage of intra-abdominal collection even with current
   antibiotics regimen. Her husband has been a good source of support to
   her in the past 24 hours especially after extubation. She is depressed.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation (AFib) status post cardioversion. She presented with right-sided weakness and progressive aphasia, leading to the discovery of a left-sided parietal abscess. The abscess has been drained, but cultures are positive for Streptococcus. There are other potential sources of infection, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and chronic sinusitis. The patient also has a fluid collection at the hilum of her spleen, which is likely due to a gastric-jejunostomy leak.

Medical Complications:
1. Brain Abscess: The patient had a brain abscess that required surgical drainage. Cultures from the abscess are positive for Streptococcus.
2. Seizures: The patient has been experiencing seizures, which have been recorded on EEG. Phenytoin has been added to her medication regimen.
3. Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: A fluid collection at the hilum of the spleen was identified, which is suspected to be a result of a gastric-jejunostomy leak.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level but stable condition. Close monitoring is advised.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had atrial fibrillation that was managed with cardioversion and medication. Currently,"

   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on nafcillin
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Phenytoin 17, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   -needs CT with IV and PO contrast for further eval for percutaneous
   drainage by IR. Cannot take PO contrast b/c has not yet had s&s eval.
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   -surgery also recommends GI consult
   -f/u surgery recs
   .
   ## S/P extubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status
   -up to chair today
   -f/u cxr
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Pt has required dilt drip in the past but
   remains in NSR.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB. No need for addtl
   agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

She was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess, which has been drained. The patient's course has been complicated by seizures. 

The patient is currently in the ICU for further management of her conditions. She is NPO pending speech and swallow evaluation tomorrow. She is unable to receive PO contrast for the requested CT abdomen due to the evaluation. 

The patient's recent imaging shows a peri-splenic fluid collection, which is suspicious of a gastrointestinal tract source given the patient's chief complaint of abdominal pain. Chronic sinusitis is also a possible source, as shown on MRI. The lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on chest X-ray. 

The patient's blood cultures have been positive for Streptococcus species. She is currently on penicillin post desensitization and nafcillin. 

The patient's seizures have been persistent despite the addition of midazolam. Her EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity. Phenytoin levels are being adjusted per neurology recommendations. 

The patient has a history of gastric jejunostomy, and there is most likely a leak at the site, leading to a splenic hilum fluid collection. Percutaneous drainage is being considered, but cannot be done without a speech and swallow evaluation"

   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on nafcillin
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Phenytoin 17, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   -needs CT with IV and PO contrast for further eval for percutaneous
   drainage by IR. Has NGT to suction and taking PO contrast through that
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   -surgery also recommends GI consult- will need to affirm what the
   overall plan is for drainage
   -f/u surgery recs
   .
   ## S/P extubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status
   -up to chair today
   -f/u cxr
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Pt has required dilt drip in the past but
   remains in NSR.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB. No need for addtl
   agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, bovine aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation post-cardioversion. She presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia, and was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess which has been drained. The patient's course was complicated by seizures.

The patient has multiple medical issues, including brain abscess, seizures, splenic hilum fluid collection, anemia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and fevers. She has been treated with various medications such as penicillin, nafcillin, dilantin, keppra, midazolam, phenytoin, flagyl, and cipro.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever (hypothermia)
- Brain abscess (CNS abscess)
- Seizures
- Splenic hilum fluid collection
- Anemia
- Atrial fibrillation
- Hypertension

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia due to inability to protect the airway.
2. Spread of infection from the brain abscess to other areas of the body.
3. Further seizures due to the presence of an abscess.
4. Complications related to the gastric jejunostomy, such as leak or obstruction.
5. Possible gastrointestinal tract infection given fluid collection at the hilum of the spleen seen on CT"

   The endotracheal tube is no longer visualized. There is an NG tube
   with tip in the stomach. There is a right IJ line with tip at the
   cavoatrial
   junction. There is left lower lobe volume loss and right lower lobe
   volume
   loss with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms and underlying infectious
   infiltrate cannot be totally excluded. Compared to the prior study, the
   change in appearance may be secondary to technique and positioning

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation (afib) who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia. She was found to have a left-sided parietal brain abscess, which has been drained. The patient also has a splenic hilum fluid collection, possibly due to a leak at her gastric jejunostomy, and is currently on ciprofloxacin and Flagyl. She has a history of seizures and is being treated with dilantin. The patient's respiratory status is stable after extubation, but she remains at risk for aspiration. She has anemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, which are being managed accordingly. The patient is NPO and will start total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's risk for aspiration is high due to her altered mental status and difficulty protecting her airway. This puts her at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including the brain abscess, splenic fluid collection, and possible sinusitis. These infections need to be closely monitored and treated appropriately.
3. Gastrointestinal (GI) leak: The splenic hilum fluid collection suggests a possible GI leak. If this leak continues, it can lead to"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has a collection of fluid (smaller) near splenic hilum that is not
   amenable to percutaneous drainage. She needs optimization of her
   nutritional status and consideration of a J tube if TPN is not a viable
   option for the next few weeks to allow wound healing around the recent
   surgical site. Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] will advise regarding these issues. She wil
   leave the ICU today as she has been seizure free on current levels of
   dilantin. Her breathing is back to baseline and her RUE weakness has
   also shown signs of improving.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is ill but improving

The cause of this collection is indeterminate, and the presence of the wedge-shaped low-attenuation abnormalities in the periphery of the spleen could represent prior infarcts. The collection would be difficult to access percutaneously and would probably require a trans-splenic approach. 

The patient also has new right lower lobe centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-bud configuration and atelectasis, suggesting recent infection or inflammation possibly due to aspiration. There is also a left adnexal ovoid homogeneous cystic abnormality that should be further assessed with ultrasound.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), current temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/70 mmHg to 121/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is currently autodiuresing and has a weight of 85.2 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,460 mL and output of 2,560 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,100 mL. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.5-11.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.9-9.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 23.5-25.8%, platelet count of 583-773, sodium of 135-142 mg/dL, potassium of 3.9-4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 96-106 mEq/L, calcium of 8.9-9.3 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.9-2.0 mg/dL, and phosphorus of 3.3-3.5 mg/dL. Other lab values include albumin of 2.8 g/dL, lactic acid of 1.5 mmol/L, and LDH of 171 IU/L. The patient's blood cultures have been pending since 9/5/21 and her sputum culture has shown growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough)
2. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)
3. Brain abs"

 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on nafcillin
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Phenytoin 17, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   -needs CT with IV and PO contrast for further eval for percutaneous
   drainage by IR. Has NGT to suction and taking PO contrast through that
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   -surgery also recommends GI consult- will need to affirm what the
   overall plan is for drainage
   -f/u surgery recs
   .
   ## S/P extubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status
   -up to chair today
   -f/u cxr
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Pt has required dilt drip in the past but
   remains in NSR.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB. No need for addtl
   agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation (afib) who presented with right-sided weakness and progressive aphasia. She was found to have a left-sided parietal brain abscess, which has been drained. The patient also has a history of seizures, and her recent negative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) suggests no current endocarditis. Other possible sources of the brain abscess include the paranasal sinuses, lungs, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Suspicion of GI tract involvement is based on the presence of a fluid collection at the hilum of the spleen seen on CT. Additionally, the patient's chief complaint of abdominal pain and MRI findings indicate chronic sinusitis as a possible source. The lungs seem unlikely given the absence of infiltrates on the chest X-ray.

The patient is currently on penicillin (PCN) after desensitization, along with nafcillin. The plan is to follow up with final abscess cultures and sensitivities and repeat MRI with gadolinium on [**2143-9-10**]. Phenytoin levels will be adjusted per neurology recommendations, aiming for a goal level of 20. The patient will continue to follow neurology recommendations, and the NGT will stay in overnight per surgery. The patient is autodiure"
