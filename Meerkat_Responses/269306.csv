   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo male s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who
   presents with high fevers, likely secondary to cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   1.  Cellulitis.  Patient with significant warmth and and erythema over
   right lower extremity.
   - doppler to r/o concurrent DVT
   - blood cultures
   - vanco
   2.  Fever/Leukocytosis.  Likely source of infection is cellulitis,
   however, pneumonia remains a possibility given chest CT findings.
   Patient at high risk for aspiration given AMS.  Also concern for
   purulent drainage from PEG.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum culture
   - f/u cultures from PEG site
   - vanco/cefepime/levo (PCN allergy) for broad spectrum coverage
   3.  Hypotension.  Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over
   several weeks in addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis).
   - IVF bolus
   - Levophed to keep MAPS > 65 if needed
   - hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax)
   - hold baclofen
   4.  Hypernatremia.  Significant hypernatremia likely refects ongoing
   infection and poor PO intake over the course of several days to week.
   Given that patient remains markedly hypovolemic, will continue with NS.
   When volume replete, will change to 1/2NS (as hyperglycemia was a
   concern).
   - NS bolus to keeps MAPS> 60
   - free water flushes through PEG
   - q8 hour sodium
   5.  Renal failure.  Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in
   MICU.  Likely from profound dehydration and possible sepsis in setting
   of cellulitis.
   - follow Cr
   - IVF boluses to keep MAPs > 65
   - check urine lytes
   6. Hyperglycemia.  Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.
   Likely elevated in setting of infection
   - Lantus + HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - while uptitrating tube feeds, will give lantus at reduced dose (10
   instead of 14); will give 14 tomorrow night
   7.  AMS.  Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p traumatic SDH x 2,
   significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT showed no acute
   process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - continue aricept
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   8.  Thrombocytopenia.  Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent
   was 137 on [**3-15**].
   - peripheral smear
   - DIC labs
   - minimize offending meds
   - obtain baseline from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   9.  Anemia.  Unclear baseline.
   - trend Hct
   - iron studies
   - guiaic stools
   10.  Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Check troponin this afternoon to complete 24 hour rule-out.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of CVA, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He presents with high fevers, likely secondary to cellulitis. The patient also has hypernatremia and acute renal failure, likely due to dehydration. He is nonverbal and requires assistance with feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient has significant warmth and erythema over the right lower extremity, indicating a possible infection. Blood cultures and Doppler to rule out concurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) should be done. Vancomycin (Vanco) should be initiated.

2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infection. Possible sources include cellulitis, pneumonia, or purulent drainage from the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum culture should be obtained. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cefepime and vancomycin, should be started while awaiting culture results.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to poor oral intake over several weeks, compounded by sepsis from the infection (cellulitis). Intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus and vasopressor support with levophed may be required to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. Antih"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). Still should rule out DVT as cause of
   fever and erythema of RLE.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
   - Follow-up doppler RLE
   #  Hypotension:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis).
   - IVF bolus as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - Q8H sodium check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.
   - Follow-up Cr with PM lytes and ongoing hydration via PEG
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Recheck PLT on PM labs
   - Minimize offending meds
   - Obtain baseline PLT count from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline.
   - trend Hct
   - iron studies
   - guiaic stools
   10.  Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of CVA, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes who presented with fevers and right leg cellulitis. The patient's vital signs indicate persistent hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 80s at admission, which improved after receiving 2.5L of normal saline (NS) bolus in addition to 5L in the Emergency Department (ED), raising the systolic blood pressure to the 90s-100s. The patient's heart rate has been mainly in the 40s with paroxysms to 100s (sinus) on telemetry with no significant change in blood pressure.

The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications. The assessment and plan include several diagnoses and corresponding management strategies:

1. Fever/Leukocytosis: The fever is likely secondary to extensive lower extremity cellulitis. Other potential causes, such as pneumonia or peri-PEG infection, should be ruled out. The patient is currently afebrile following admission, and the white blood cell count has decreased from 14.0 to 10.9. However, it is important to continue monitoring for signs of infection and rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as a cause of fever and erythema of the right lower extremity. The patient should continue receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Follow-up blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). Still should rule out DVT as cause of
   fever and erythema of RLE.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
   - Follow-up doppler RLE
   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear
   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;
   however, will continue to monitor.
   - IVF bolus as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - Q8H sodium check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.
   - Follow-up Cr with PM lytes and ongoing hydration via PEG
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   # Hypocalcemia:
   Corrected Ca of 7.3 this AM.
   - Replete and recheck Ca on PM lytes
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM. DIC labs negative yesterday for signs of DIC.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Recheck PLT on PM labs
   - Minimize offending meds
   - Obtain baseline PLT count from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline. Down slightly to 31.4 from 35.5 at admission. Not
   iron deficient by labs (ferritin 1478 and FeSat = 44%).
   - Trend HCT
   - Guiaic stools
   # Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Check troponin this afternoon to complete 24 hour rule-out.
   #  Sacral decubitis ulcer:
   - Wound care via nursing

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of CVA, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents with fever to 106 degrees Fahrenheit, likely secondary to extensive lower extremity cellulitis. He also has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely due to dehydration. The patient is non-verbal and responds only to pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the chest CT findings, pneumonia should be considered as a possible cause of fever and leukocytosis.
2. Peri-PEG Infection: The presence of purulent drainage around the PEG tube suggests a possible infection at the site.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Despite the erythema and warmth over the right lower extremity, the lack of erythema tracking across the groin to the sacrum makes DVT less likely. However, it should still be ruled out as a cause of fever and erythema.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's baseline heart rate is in the low 50s, which could be linked to his overall condition but requires further monitoring.
5. Hypernatremia: The significant hypernatremia may reflect ongoing infection and poor oral intake. It needs to be corrected with free water via the PEG.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, likely secondary to dehydration and possible sepsis"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

- The patient has a history of low blood pressure (hypotension) with systolic readings in the 80s, despite receiving fluids. Blood pressure has improved to the 90s-100s after administration of a 2.5L normal saline bolus.
- The patient's heart rate (HR) has been oscillating between the 40s and 100s on telemetry.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hypernatremia (high sodium levels), hypotension (not in shock), hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and fever.
- The patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren 2.0 at a rate of 20 mL/hour.
- The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and multi-lumen line.
- Prophylactic measures are being taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. If sepsis progresses to septic shock, it can lead to further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) complications: DKA is a serious condition characterized by high blood sugar, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. Complications"

   Disposition: ICU care for now
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of CVA, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He presents with high fevers, likely secondary to cellulitis, and has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely due to dehydration. The patient is nonverbal and requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient has significant warmth and erythema over the right lower extremity, indicating a possible bacterial infection. This could lead to worsening infection, sepsis, and systemic complications.
2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient's high fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. This may indicate a risk of developing sepsis and related complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to poor oral intake and sepsis from the infection. If not treated promptly, it could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's significantly elevated sodium levels suggest dehydration and possible electrolyte imbalances. If not corrected, it may result in neurological complications and further renal dysfunction.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction. If not managed properly, this could progress to chronic renal failure.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels are likely exacerbated by infection and inadequate nutritional intake. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections and other complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents with high fevers, likely secondary to cellulitis, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure likely due to dehydration. The patient is nonverbal and requires full code status. He has significant warmth and erythema over the right lower extremity, suggesting possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There are concerns about pneumonia, aspiration, and purulent drainage from the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site.

Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient has significant warmth and erythema over the right lower extremity, indicating cellulitis. Doppler study should be performed to rule out concurrent DVT. Blood cultures should be obtained, and vancomycin should be initiated.
2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum culture should be followed up. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin) should be initiated.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to poor oral intake and sepsis. IV fluid bolus, vasopressor (Levophed), and holding antihypertensive medications are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). RLE U/S negative as source of
   fever/cellulitis.  CXR without evidence of PNA, likely atelectasis at
   LLL.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime
   - d/c levo
   - Follow-up blood cultures
 currently negative
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
 GM stain GPC/GNR
   - RLE doppler negative for DVT as source of cellulitis
   - follow fever curve.  Remains afebrile
   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear
   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;
   however, will continue to monitor.  BP stable while in MICU.
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   # VT code:
   Patient with episode of pulseless/unresponsive VT on [**3-25**] 7PM, code
   called, no shock delivered, CPR initiated but stopped immediately after
   initiation due to pt spontaneous recovery of pulse.  Awake and
   responsive afterwards, post-code EKG without ST elevations, appears to
   be intermittent atrial tachy with baseline bradycardia, troponin/CK
   continued trend downward since admission.
   - Cardiology consult
   - Echo today
   - Cont telemetry
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.  Trending downward slowly.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - cont daily electrolytes check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.  Creatinine
   trended downward to normal over course of rehydration.
   - Follow-up Cr with ongoing hydration via PEG and daily electrolytes
   checks
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.  Taken off insulin gtt without complications.
   FSBG trending into acceptable range in sliding scale and lantus.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.  Mental status improved over course of MICU
   stay with hydration and treatment of infection.
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime for infection
   # Hypocalcemia:
   Corrected Ca of 7.3 this AM.  Remained stable without issues
   - Replete and recheck Ca on PM lytes
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM, stable in 90
s. DIC labs negative yesterday for signs of DIC.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Cont to follow plts.  Unlikely DIC at this point.
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline. Down slightly to 31.4 from 35.5 at admission. Not
   iron deficient by labs (ferritin 1478 and FeSat = 44%).
   - Trend HCT, stable
   - Guiaic stools
   # Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Continued downward trend of troponin post-VT code, unlikely MI
   #  Sacral decubitis ulcer:
   - Wound care via nursing

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of stroke, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents with fever, likely secondary to extensive lower extremity cellulitis. The patient also has hypernatremia and acute renal failure, which are likely due to dehydration. Other notable findings include leukocytosis, hypotension, bradycardia, an episode of ventricular tachycardia, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient's mental status has improved with hydration and treatment of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension suggest a possible infection-related systemic inflammatory response, which can progress to sepsis if not promptly addressed.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction, possibly due to dehydration and infection.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the right lower extremity ultrasound was negative, it is important to continue monitoring for signs and symptoms of DVT, as the patient has risk factors such as immobility and infection.
4. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of ventricular tachycardia, which requires further evaluation and management by cardiology.
5. Sacral Decubitus Ul"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). RLE U/S negative as source of
   fever/cellulitis.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - Follow-up blood cultures
 currently negative
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
 GM stain GPC/GNR
   - RLE doppler negative for DVT as source of cellulitis
   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear
   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;
   however, will continue to monitor.
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   # VT code:
   Patient with episode of pulseless/unresponsive VT on [**3-25**] 7PM, code
   called, no shock delivered, CPR initiated but stopped immediately after
   initiation due to pt spontaneous recovery of pulse.  Awake and
   responsive afterwards, post-code EKG without ST elevations, appears to
   be intermittent atrial tachy with baseline bradycardia, troponin/CK
   continued trend downward since admission.
   - Cardiology consult
   - Cont telemetry
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.  Trending downward slowly.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - Q8H sodium check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.
   - Follow-up Cr with PM lytes and ongoing hydration via PEG
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   # Hypocalcemia:
   Corrected Ca of 7.3 this AM.
   - Replete and recheck Ca on PM lytes
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM. DIC labs negative yesterday for signs of DIC.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Recheck PLT on PM labs
   - Minimize offending meds
   - Obtain baseline PLT count from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline. Down slightly to 31.4 from 35.5 at admission. Not
   iron deficient by labs (ferritin 1478 and FeSat = 44%).
   - Trend HCT
   - Guiaic stools
   # Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Continued downward trend of troponin post-VT code, unlikely MI
   #  Sacral decubitis ulcer:
   - Wound care via nursing

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of CVA, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes who presents with fever, likely secondary to extensive lower extremity cellulitis. He also has hypernatremia and acute renal failure, likely due to dehydration. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple comorbidities including AMS (Alzheimer's disease), hypotension, bradycardia, thrombocytopenia, hypocalcemia, anemia, and troponin leak.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged bed rest, he is at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Despite a negative RLE U/S, there is still a possibility of DVT due to the patient's immobilization and other risk factors.
3. Peri-PEG infection: The presence of purulent drainage around the PEG site indicates a potential infection at the insertion site.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels suggest a possible septic state.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and acute renal failure may progress to AKI if not appropriately managed.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia and recent episode of pulseless/unresponsive"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of CVA, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes who presented with fever, likely secondary to extensive lower extremity cellulitis. The patient also has hypernatremia and acute renal failure, which is likely due to dehydration. Other conditions include pneumonia, potential peri-PEG infection, hypotension/bradycardia, VT code, hypernatremia, AMS, hypocalcemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and troponin leak.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's chest CT shows findings consistent with pneumonia. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and sepsis.
2. Peri-PEG infection: The presence of purulent drainage around the PEG tube suggests a possible infection at the site. If not treated promptly, this could lead to worsening local infection and potentially systemic sepsis.
3. Cellulitis: The extensive erythema and warmth in the right lower extremity indicate cellulitis. If the infection spreads or if the patient's immune response weakens, this could result in sepsis and tissue necrosis.
4. Hypotension/Bradycardia: The patient's low blood pressure and bradycardia may indicate poor perfusion and reduced cardiac output. This can lead to organ dysfunction and potential shock.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-inch tall male with a weight of 210 pounds. He is currently in the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided progress note.

On 24/03/2115, the patient experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) code at 7 pm before being transferred to the floor. No shock was given, and the patient regained his pulse on his own during the initiation of CPR. The post-arrest EKG showed no ST elevations, suggesting a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient likely had episodes of atrial tachycardia with a baseline possible junctional rhythm. A plan for a cardiology evaluation has been made, and an echo is scheduled on 03/26/2115.

The patient has several known drug allergies, including Haldol (Haloperidol), penicillins, and Augmentin (Amox Tr/Potassium Clavulanate). The last dose of antibiotics, cefepime, was administered on 03/24/2115 at 08:56 PM.

The patient's vital signs on 03/26/2115 at 06:09 AM include a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius (97.1 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 57 beats per minute (44-100 bpm), a blood pressure of 115/56 mmHg"
