 ANXIETY
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy, coronary artery disease and
   non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Hypoxia: Worsening over the past three days.  Imaging suggestive of
   multifocal pneumonia likely from aspiration.  Of concern, patient has
   been on high dose steroids for the past month.  No evidence of large
   pulmonary embolism on CT scan.  Cardiac enzymes not elevated.  Likely
   worsened by anemia.  Currently maintaining oxygen saturations with 50%
   face tent.  Not using accessory muscles currently.  ABG with
   respiratory alkalosis.  Although patient with evidence of anasarca, do
   not feel that pulmonary edema is large component of his current
   presentation.

   stump leak.  Surgery not performed here.
   - will consult with thoracis regarding finding
   Presumed Ulcerative Colitis:  Per notes continues to have [**2-13**] bloody
   bowel movements per day without significant improvement since
   presentation.  Sigmoidoscopy on [**12-1**] with persistent severe
   inflammation.  Now on methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID.  No longer on
   cyclosporin. Patient with significant malnutrition and anasarca.
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
   - appreciate GI recs
   - continue TPN
   - NPO for now given concern for aspiration
   - GI surgery following
   - c. diff negative most recently on [**12-3**]
   Acute Blood Loss Anemia:  Patient with known gastrointestinal bleeding
   and witnessed blood loss from pulling out PICC in the setting of
   elevated INR yesterday.  Now s/p 2 units of PRBC with hematocrit
   increase from only 21.3 to 25.3.
   - active type and screen
   - currently PICC line and 1 22 g IV, will obtain additional peripheral
   access
   - repeat hematocrit tonight
   - GI following
   DV: Incidental finding of right sided lower extremity DVT.  INR
   currently 2.4.  Currently hemodynamically stable but in the setting of
   gastrointestinal bleeding will hold coumadin for now and let INRtrend
   down.  If persistent bleeding, would consider IVC filter.
   - holding coumadin
   - if hematocrit stable, start heparin when subtherapeutic
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus: In the setting of poor nutrition,
   hypoalbuminemia and bedrest.
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - holding PO meds (vitamin C, zinc)
   - wound care
   Hypothyroidism: Home dose is synthroid PO 88 mcg daily
   - IV synthroid 50 mcg daily
   CAD s/p MI: No chest pain or new EKG changes currently.  Troponins
   flat.
   - holding aspirin, beta blocker (given NPO)
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   NSCLC s/p resection: As above, concern for bronchial stump leak.
   Otherwise no active issues.
   Prostate Cancer:  s/p prostatectomy. CT with sclerotic/lucent lesions
   in vertebral bodies but bone scan okay.
   - outpatient oncology followup
   Type II Diabetes:
   - receives 37 units regular insulin in TPN
   - TID sliding scale

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, non-small cell lung cancer, and previous surgeries.
- He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and shortness of breath.
- The patient has worsening hypoxia over the past three days, likely due to multifocal pneumonia possibly caused by aspiration.
- He is on high-dose steroids for ulcerative colitis and has been experiencing bloody bowel movements.
- The patient has a history of malnutrition and anasarca.
- He has a hydropneumothorax, presumed to be from a bronchial stump leak.
- The patient also has acute blood loss anemia, secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding and blood loss during PICC line removal.
- He has a right-sided lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient is at risk for skin integrity issues due to poor nutrition, hypoalbuminemia, and prolonged bedrest.
- He has hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction, non-small cell lung cancer status post resection, prostate cancer status post prostatectomy, and type II diabetes.
- The patient is currently on various medications including antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, insulin, and prophylactic heparin.
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 111/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, dry mucous membranes, edematous extremities, and a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer.
- Lab results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.
- Imaging studies show multifocal pneumonia, hydropneumothorax, and evidence of anasarca.
- The patient's plan includes continued antibiotic therapy, steroid treatment, nutritional support, and surgical evaluation for potential interventions.
- Potential complications include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, anxiety, and further bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. His underlying lung cancer and aspiration pneumonia may contribute to this risk.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia, and prolonged bedrest increase the likelihood of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers, as evidenced by the stage II sacral decubitus ulcer.
3. Anxiety: The patient's mild delirium and agitation may be indicative of anxiety, which can be exacerbated by the ICU environment and medical interventions.
4. Further Bleeding: The patient's acute blood loss anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding indicate a risk for further bleeding, especially considering his ongoing use of anticoagulant therapy and the presence of a DVT.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to chronic steroid use and malignancy increases the risk of infection, particularly hospital-acquired pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient's right-sided lower extremity DVT highlights the risk"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and shortness of breath. The patient has multifocal pneumonia likely from aspiration, as well as anemia, anxiety, and respiratory failure. The patient also has a hydropneumothorax, presumed ulcerative colitis, acute blood loss anemia, DVT, stage II sacral/buttock decubitus, hypothyroidism, CAD s/p MI, NSCLC s/p resection, prostate cancer, and type II diabetes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure due to pneumonia and respiratory distress.
2. Bleeding due to gastrointestinal issues and the use of anticoagulant therapy.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and potential pulmonary embolism.
4. Pressure ulcers (stage II sacral/buttock decubitus).
5. Malnutrition and anasarca.
6. Bronchial stump leak.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction.
9. Complications related to prostate cancer.

The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, hydropneumothorax, anemia secondary to GI bleeding, severe colitis, elevated BUN likely due to upper GI bleed and steroids, and decubitus ulcers. The patient's current medications include solumedrol, lorazepam (Ativan), haloperidol (Haldol), and pantoprazole (Protonix).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's baseline severe emphysema and recent VATS surgery increase the risk of respiratory failure. The patient's current hypoxic respiratory failure needs close monitoring and management.

2. Pneumonia: Aspiration pneumonia is probable due to the patient's recent surgery and severe emphysema. Monitoring for signs of infection and pneumonia is important.

3. GI bleeding: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to GI bleeding. Continued monitoring for signs of bleeding and ongoing blood loss is necessary. 

4. Colitis: The patient has severe colitis, and it is important to evaluate and manage it appropriately to prevent further complications.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He is currently in the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and shortness of breath. 

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing confusion and delirium, which may be due to various factors such as medication use, underlying medical conditions, or infections.

2. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient has acute anemia likely due to ongoing blood loss from a slow gastrointestinal bleed. This is evidenced by his low hemoglobin levels and the need for blood transfusion.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer, indicating impaired skin integrity. This requires wound care and nutritional support.

4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and respiratory alkalosis. This is likely due to multifocal pneumonia and aspiration, as indicated by the presence of fever and infiltrates on imaging. 

5. Anxiety: The patient also has anxiety, which may be related to his current medical condition and hospitalization.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's need for high-flow oxygen and the presence of pneumonia, there is a risk of developing VAP if the patient requires prolonged"

","Summary:
- Patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea.
- The patient has been experiencing bloody stools and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration, indicating acute anemia due to blood loss.
- He has impaired skin integrity and respiratory failure, possibly secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient also has anxiety, a history of a left femoral vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stage II sacral/buttock decubitus, coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction (CAD s/p MI), and type II diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event overnight, which may have led to the development of aspiration pneumonia. This condition can cause respiratory failure and requires aggressive treatment.
2. Bleeding: The patient's ongoing bloody stools and acute anemia indicate ongoing blood loss. This could potentially lead to hypovolemic shock if not promptly addressed.
3. DVT: Although the patient is on anticoagulation therapy, the presence of a previous DVT increases the risk of further thrombotic events. Monitoring for signs of clot progression is important.
4. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage II sacral/buttock decubitus, which requires wound care and prevention of further skin breakdown.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung, who underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. He was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure and has developed several complications. These include hypoxic respiratory failure requiring possible intubation, hydropneumothorax likely related to recent surgery, anemia with acute blood loss due to colitis, severe colitis requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN), elevated BUN likely due to upper GI bleed and steroids, and decubitus ulcer requiring wound care. The patient also has stage 1B poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung without evidence of metastasis. His current condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent surgery, severe emphysema, and failure to tolerate PO fluids put him at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's need for respiratory support and prolonged intubation, he is at risk for developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT increases his risk for developing another one while in the ICU.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU can lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
5. Nosocomial infections: The patient's compromised immune system due to cancer and prolonged hospital stay make him susceptible to nosocomial infections.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated BUN and potential for decreased renal perfusion increase his risk for AKI.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe emphysema and recent surgery may lead to further respiratory compromise.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing use of NSAIDs increase his risk for recurrent bleeding."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical conditions. They have a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), coronary artery disease (CAD), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) status post video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to severe emphysema, recent VATS surgery, and probable aspiration pneumonia. They also have a hydropneumothorax likely related to the recent surgery. Other issues include anemia likely caused by GI bleeding, severe colitis requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) possibly from an upper GI bleed and steroids, and a decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's severe emphysema, recent VATS surgery, and probable aspiration pneumonia put them at risk for worsening respiratory function and potential respiratory failure.
2. Hydropneumothorax: The presence of a hydropneumothorax indicates a potential complication related to the recent surgery. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and compromised lung function.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if the underlying cause, such as GI bleeding, is not addressed promptly.
4. Colitis: Severe colitis can lead to complications such as perforation, abscess formation, sepsis,"

   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Hypoxia/Possible PNA: Required 95% high flow after witnessed aspiration
   but now back to 60%; previous CT consistant with multifocal pneumonia
   and aspiration.  Also concern for immunosuppressed state given chronic
   steroid use.  ABG with continued respiratory alkalosis.
   - consider switch vanc/Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - watch for fatigue given continued respiratory distress.
   Presumed Ulcerative Colitis:  continue w/ bloody bowel movement with
   HCT drop.
   - 2 units RBC this am
   - q8 HCT checks
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID

   Acute Blood loss: continues slow GI bleed as above; no evidence of
   additional souce of bleeding
   - active type and screen
   - q8 HCT checks
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.  INR elevated but
   trending down (1.7)
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - if hematocrit stable, start heparin when subtherapeutic
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - holding PO meds (vitamin C, zinc)
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, 1 22 g IV

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual presenting with hypoxemia, respiratory distress, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and anemia. The patient has been experiencing tachypnea and acute respiratory alkalosis. Oxygenation has been marginal, and anxiety persists despite the administration of Lasix. The patient has also had maroon-colored stool, indicating potential blood loss. Two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) have been transfused, increasing the hematocrit from 23 to 28. Platelets are trending downward.

The patient is currently on high-flow nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 97%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals a pH of 7.55, PaCO2 of 25, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 82. Physical examination shows mild respiratory distress, but no signs of pallor or scleral edema. Cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. Respiratory/chest examination shows clear breath sounds on the right side, except for a few rhonchi at the base, while the left base has bronchial breath sounds without egophony or wheezes. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Extremities show trace edema but no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination reveals attentiveness and response to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 87 K/uL, platelet count of 115 mg/dL, sodium level of 140 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, and chloride level of 100 mEq/L. Blood cultures were collected on multiple occasions, with no growth observed. Imaging studies reveal diffuse emphysema, patchy infiltrates in the right upper and lower lobes, left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion, as well as a patchy infiltrate at the right base.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current conditions include delirium/confusion, acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), anxiety, pneumonia, and GI bleed. The patient continues on antibiotics and has shown improvement in oxygen saturation levels. Efforts are being made to ambulate the patient to a chair. The hematocrit has improved with transfusions, and the GI bleeding appears to have slowed. Heparin therapy is initiated to maintain off coumadin, with a goal PTT of 60.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if oxygenation cannot be adequately maintained.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of patchy infiltrates on imaging suggests pneumonia, which can progress and lead to worsening respiratory distress.
3. GI Bleed: Although the GI bleeding has slowed"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy as per ARDSnet protocol.

The patient's medical history includes a recent left upper lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer, coronary artery disease with a previous myocardial infarction, and ulcerative colitis. He is on chronic immunosuppressive therapy for his conditions.

The patient's current laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 21.9%, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated troponin T levels. His blood cultures have been drawn, and he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the left base, and there is evidence of skin integrity issues with dried blood and possible ulcerations on the oral mucosa. The patient is also experiencing delirium and confusion.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.3Â°C (101Â°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 91/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute,"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now meets ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110.  Intubated
   for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been treated with vanc/zosyn
   atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Try pressure support for now to see if this helps his MV
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - Add Levofloxacin
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 2 U this AM.
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
   - GI following
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Continue heparin gtt and monitor for signs of bleeding
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 110. He has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration pneumonia. The patient is also being treated with the ARDSnet protocol, which involves low tidal volume ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is sedated and not responsive, indicating the presence of delirium or confusion.
2. Anemia, Acute: The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped from 28% to 21.9%, indicating acute anemia, likely secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding).
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: There are ulcerations on the oral mucosa, which may indicate impaired skin integrity.
4. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure.
5. Anxiety: The patient may be experiencing anxiety due to the ICU environment and medical conditions.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now meets ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110.  Intubated
   for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been treated with vanc/zosyn
   atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - Add Levofloxacin
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 2 U this AM.
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently on invasive ventilation, and ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes is being followed. The patient also has a history of DVT, previous myocardial infarction, sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer, and type II diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is showing signs of delirium and confusion, which can be a result of several factors such as sedation, sepsis, or hypoxia.
2. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient has experienced blood loss due to hemorrhage and bleeding, leading to acute anemia. This can compromise tissue perfusion and oxygenation.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to prolonged immobility and pressure ulcers. This increases the risk of infection and complications.
4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Despite being intubated and on ARDSnet protocol, the patient still faces the risk of acute respiratory failure due to underlying lung pathology.
5. Anxiety: The patient"

   Patient continues to be hypotensive. Will restart stress dose steroids.
   Try to wean norepi. Appears to be volume repleted with resolution of
   tachycardia and good urine output. Continue broad spectrum antibiotics.
   Cultures unrevealing thus far.
   Patient continues to show evidence of high inspiratory drive. Has been
   fighting vent for bigger tidal volumes. Given blood pressure problems,
   I am loathe to further sedate him. With low pressures on vent when on
   assist control, I think we can allow him to be on PSV with tidal
   volumes of 600-650, which is what he seems to want. Will also pressure
   control ventilation to see if he will be more comfortable with that.
   Hct drifting down with fluids. With hx of GI bleed, will transfuse with

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110.  Intubated
   for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been treated with vanc/zosyn
   atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Try pressure support for now to see if this helps his MV
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - Add Levofloxacin
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   BRPBR: Patient had two episodes BRBPR o/n losing approximately 1 L
   fluid and is s/p 2U PRBC. Appropriate Hct improvement. Gi aware
   - Continue to trend Hct
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 2 U this AM.
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
   - GI following
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Continue heparin gtt and monitor for signs of bleeding
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, Heparin gtt, protonix
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus
   Code:  DNR
   Disposition: ICU care for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient met ARDS criteria and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and atypical coverage was added. The patient had two episodes of BRBPR, resulting in a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, requiring blood transfusions. He also has thrombocytopenia, likely related to infection or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Other medical conditions include stage II sacral/buttock decubitus, coronary artery disease with a previous myocardial infarction, and type II diabetes. The patient has been placed on DNR status and is currently receiving ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms, such as increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea, along with the presence of diffuse alveolar damage on imaging, indicate a high possibility of ARDS. Complications associated with ARDS include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis"

","The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath (SOB). The patient received a 2-unit red blood cell transfusion due to a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) to 22. The patient was also started on stress dose steroids, which may have been related to hypotension or a possible treatment for non-infectious pulmonary process. 

The patient became tachycardic in the afternoon but responded to 1 liter of saline. It was difficult to synchronize the patient to the ventilator as they were overbreathing with high minute ventilation. Lavage with clot was performed. The patient was made do not resuscitate (DNR) after speaking with the family. 

The patient had two episodes of bloody brown-colored sputum since midnight requiring two units of red blood cell transfusion; gastrointestinal (GI) team was made aware. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were administered on 12/11/2146 at 04:00 PM (Piperacillin/Tazobactam), 07:29 PM (Vancomycin), and 07:29 PM (Levofloxacin).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples - ? PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypotension
 On stress dose steroids Hydrocortisone. Ddx adrenal
   insufficiency vs hypovolemia.
   - Fluid bolus prn for hypotsn
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 4 u yesterday (2
   am, 2 o/n). Transitioned methylprednisolone to stress dosed steroids
   for hypotension. BP not significantly improved since stress dose
   steroids.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
 Hydrocortoisone
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - Check plain film Abd
 upright and decub
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. He meets ARDS criteria with a PO2/FiO2 of 110. The patient has high minute ventilation and sedation causing him to be hypotensive. He requires stress dose steroids due to suspected adrenal insufficiency or hypovolemia. The patient has a history of DVT, thrombocytopenia, NSCLC s/p resection, stage II sacral/buttock decubitus, CAD s/p MI, type II diabetes, and delirium/confusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient meets ARDS criteria with a PO2/FiO2 of 110. Close monitoring and management according to ARDSnet protocol is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and there is a concern for aspiration due to his altered mental status and inability to protect his airway. Bronchoscopy may be considered for samples, especially to rule out Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and shortness of breath. The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration. He is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has low airway pressures and good lung compliance, not consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient has been experiencing bronchial real-time polymerase chain reaction (BRBPR) with decreasing hematocrit (Hct), which may be related to acute ischemia or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient is also hypotensive and likely in septic shock, worsened by acute blood loss. 

The patient is on chronic immunosuppression for his ulcerative colitis, but it is not providing relief. He may require colectomy, but he is not a surgical candidate at this time. The patient also has a left femoral vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is on heparin.

Other assessments and plans include continuing total parenteral nutrition (TPN), abdominal X-ray, monitoring for signs of bleeding while on heparin, and considering an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter if bleeding persists. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements and shortness of breath. The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration. He is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. The patient has been experiencing episodes of bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory failure. He also has a history of left femoral vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is on Coumadin. The patient's current medications include midazolam, norepinephrine, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and TPN with lipids. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 112/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on ventilator support. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.3 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 46 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and abnormal electrolyte levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and shortness of breath. The patient has been experiencing bloody stools, hypotension, and tachycardia. He is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated glucose levels. He has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and a history of myocardial infarction. The patient's condition is complicated by ARDS, potential gastrointestinal bleeding, and possible PCP infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing bloody stools and is on chronic immunosuppressive therapy for ulcerative colitis. This puts him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and anemia.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's oxygen requirements have been increasing, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. He meets the criteria for ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can be life-threatening.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of low blood pressure, which could be due to hypovolemia from gastrointestinal bleeding or adrenal insufficiency.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low,"

   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who is currently in the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath (SOB). 

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possible aspiration pneumonia (APNA), anion-gap acidosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thrombocytopenia, stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer, coronary artery disease with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and tachycardia, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 104/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure control ventilation (PCV) and assist.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.3, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) of 25.9%, and low platelet count (Plt) of 46. Other lab values indicate elevated glucose levels and abnormal electrolyte levels, including potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride"

   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and shortness of breath. The patient has several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thrombocytopenia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stage II sacral/buttock decubitus. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has been experiencing bloody stools and has received blood transfusions. He is at risk for further bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, indicating possible hypovolemia due to GIB or adrenal insufficiency.
3. ARDS: The patient's oxygenation parameters are below normal, and he has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. He meets the criteria for ARDS and may require additional interventions.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to infection or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
5. DVT: The patient has a confirmed DVT in the left femoral vein and is currently on hold heparin.
6. Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus: The patient has developed a pressure ulcer, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory issues. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There are multiple medical complications noted, including delirium, acute respiratory failure, anxiety, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has also experienced GI bleeding and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs are stable with some fluctuations in blood pressure. Fluid balance shows a net loss of 1,590 mL since midnight. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose, and electrolyte levels. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and diuretics. An echocardiogram and bronchoscopy have been ordered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be due to aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or other causes. The patient is already receiving mechanical ventilation, and further interventions such as bronchoscopy and broad-spectrum antibiotics are planned.
2. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, and monitoring of hematocrit levels is recommended. The exact cause of the bleeding needs to be identified and treated accordingly.
3. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and other"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting. They have a history of ulcerative colitis and are currently intubated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/61 mmHg to 120/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. They have a history of antibiotic use, including piperacillin, caspofungin, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, ulcerative colitis, delirium/confusion, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, anxiety, and acute kidney injury. They have multiple medical complications and are on various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, argatroban, pantoprazole, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's history of antibiotic use and presence of fever may indicate an increased risk for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and laboratory parameters is crucial.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury. Monitoring"

   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and shortness of breath. The patient's course has been complicated by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with respiratory failure. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 70% FiO2. His physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the left base, trace lower extremity edema, and mild mental status changes.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, elevated creatinine at 2.2 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 115 mEq/L. Coagulation studies demonstrate a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 22.8 seconds, prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 69.3 seconds, and decreased fibrinogen level of 261 mg/dL.

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been complicated by DVT, BRBPR, GIB, ARDS, and infection with Aspergillus. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains hypoxic. The patient's lab results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances. He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient remains hypoxic despite being on mechanical ventilation. This could be due to ARDS or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings may be necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of infection with Aspergillus and is currently being treated with caspofungin. Regular monitoring of blood, sputum, and urine cultures is important to assess response to treatment and detect any new infections.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to infection or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Argatroban is being used as an alternative anticoagulant while HIT is pending. Monitoring of platelet count and further"

   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.  Sputum growing Aspergillus from [**12-11**]. Bronhoscopy
   performed [**12-13**] and crimson fluid sent to lab.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - f/u BAL micro data
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**]). Continue Caspofungin for Aspergillus growing from
   sputum [**12-11**]
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin. Now s/p IVC
   filter.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Heparin replaced by Argatroban for ? HIT (antibody pending)
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be HIT. Using
   Argatrobam for now.
   - f/u HIT panel
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). He has been treated with various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's condition has met the criteria for ARDS, characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. This condition can lead to progressive respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. DVT/PE: The patient has a history of DVT and has developed a PE. There is a risk of further thromboembolic events, which could lead to complications such as another PE or limb ischemia.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, particularly pneumonia and bloodstream infections, due to his prolonged ICU stay and immunocompromised state.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and chronic immunosuppressive therapy puts him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia from gastrointestinal bleeding or adrenal insufficiency."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea. Course complicated by DVT and BRBPR.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC x 1with transfusion threshold hct 25
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - F/u Surgery reccs
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Decrease stress dose steroids Hydrocortisone 100 q 8 to 100 q 12
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.  Sputum growing Aspergillus from [**12-11**]. Bronhoscopy
   performed [**12-13**] and crimson fluid sent to lab.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Plan for I/O negative 1 L
   - f/u BAL micro data
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**]). Continue Caspofungin for Aspergillus growing from
   sputum [**12-11**]
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin. Now s/p IVC
   filter.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Heparin replaced by Argatroban for ? HIT (antibody pending)
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be HIT. Using
   Argatrobam for now.
   - f/u HIT panel
   - transfuse if less than 10
   - Order Blood smear
   - Hem/Onc consult
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, Argatroban
   FEN: Goal I/O negative 1 L today. Plan for lasix prn.
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and tacypnea. The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient now meets ARDS criteria with a PO2/FiO2 of 110. There is concern for aspiration pneumonia. The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. He remains somewhat hypoxic despite being on pressure control ventilation.

2. DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis): The patient has a left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin. An IVC (inferior vena cava) filter was placed. Heparin has been replaced by argatroban due to suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, likely related to infection or HIT. Argatroban is being used for now.

4. Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has chronic ulcerative colitis that has not responded to immunosuppressive therapy. GI surgery is recommended as the patient likely needs a colectomy but is not a surgical candidate at the moment"
