   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as needed to maintain her MAP > 65.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn as the patient is
   being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.  Will
   check vanc level in the am to dose vanc by level.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr in the ED was
   eleavated to 3.7 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3).  FENa was 0.2, supporting
   a prerenal state.  This am it has trended down to ***.  Most likely
   differential includes prerenal vs ATN from recent hypotension.  Also to
   consider are other intrarenal causes such as AIN or postrenal
   obstruction.  UA was moderately positive with 3-5 WBC, few back, and
   small leuk.
   - IVF as above for fluid resuscitation.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Will recheck EKG in the am and monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss anticoagulation with the team in the am.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was ***
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She presents from her nursing home with sepsis and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her current condition.

1. Sepsis/Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for sepsis and pneumonia, with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) due to her hypotension in the emergency department. Monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP), fluid resuscitation, and maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 are important in managing her septic state.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline, indicating acute kidney injury. This could be due to prerenal causes, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or other intrarenal causes. IV fluid resuscitation, renal dosing of medications, and avoidance of nephrotoxins are necessary.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation in the emergency department. She does not have a known history of this condition. Rate control and anticoagulation should be considered after further evaluation.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is low, indicating an"

She was given additional IV fluids and started on levophed for low mean arterial pressures (MAPs) even with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-4. Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IV fluid boluses to maintain her CVP at 8-12.
   - Continue levophed as needed to maintain her MAP > 65.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and urine output (UOP) > 30 cc/hr.
   - Broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) as the patient is being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED. Will check Vanc level in the am to dose Vanc by level.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as needed to maintain her MAP > 65.   As her
   pressures have been good, can attempt to wean levophed to day.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn as the patient is
   being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.  Will
   check vanc level in evening to dose vanc by level.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr in the ED was
   eleavated to 3.7 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3).  FENa was 0.2, supporting
   a prerenal state.  This am it has trended down to 2.5.  Most likely
   differential includes prerenal vs ATN from recent hypotension.  Also to
   consider are other intrarenal causes such as AIN or postrenal
   obstruction.  UA was moderately positive with 3-5 WBC, few back, and
   small leuk.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with
   her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
   - Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 26.9.
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's disease, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She presents from her nursing home with sepsis. The patient has been meeting SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia in the emergency department. Likely source of infection is pulmonary given the infiltrates seen on chest X-ray. A central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from 7-4. She was given additional IV fluids and started on levophed for low MAPs even with CVP of 8-4. Urinary Legionella returned negative. The patient is being admitted to the ICU with the following assessments and plans:

1. Sepsis/PNA: The patient will continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and Zosyn due to the hypotension in the ED. The urinary Legionella test is negative, and blood cultures are pending. Levophed will be continued as needed to maintain MAP > 65. The patient will be weaned off levophed gradually. IV fluid boluses will be given to maintain CVP 8-12 and UOP > 30cc/hr.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine has trended down from 3.7 to 2.5. FENa was 0.2, supporting a prerenal state."

","The patient is an 83-year-old female admitted with altered mental status from a nursing home and found to have sepsis at presentation with a likely pulmonary source. She has developed atrial fibrillation, which is complicating her hemodynamic picture. The patient has been placed on CVL (central venous line) and started on Levophed for blood pressure support in the setting of optimal fluid support and a CVP (central venous pressure) of 13 this morning.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis likely due to a pulmonary source. She will be moved to support and treatment for hospital-acquired organisms. She is currently receiving Levophed, Vanco/Zosyn antibiotics, and her CVP is being maintained at 12 to titrate down Levophed as possible.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, which will need to be considered in relation to significant fall risk during anticoagulation. For now, the focus will be on rate control as needed, and an ECHO (echocardiogram) and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) will be done when stabilized.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia in the right lower lobe. Follow-up evaluation with a CT (computed tomography) scan is important to consider after the resolution of pneumonia. She will continue with Vanco/Z"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's disease, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She presents from her nursing home with sepsis and has met SIRS criteria. The likely source of infection is pulmonary given the presence of infiltrates on chest X-ray and a slightly positive urine analysis. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. Her CVP ranges from 7-4 and she has been given additional intravenous fluids (IVF) and started on levophed for low mean arterial pressures (MAPs) even with a CVP of 8-4. Urinary legionella returned negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recurrent pneumonia and currently presents with infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating a possible new or worsening pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with sepsis and meeting SIRS criteria suggests a systemic infection that could lead to organ dysfunction.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is trending down towards baseline, indicating pre-renal acute kidney injury. IVF management and close monitoring of renal function are recommended.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation on her emergency department EKG. Rate control and anticoagulation should be considered after discussing the risks and benefits with"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   This is an 83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as needed to maintain her MAP > 65.   As her
   pressures have been good, can attempt to wean levophed to day.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn as the patient is
   being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.  Will
   check vanc level in evening to dose vanc by level.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr in the ED was
   eleavated to 3.7 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3).  FENa was 0.2, supporting
   a prerenal state.  This am it has trended down to 2.5.  Most likely
   differential includes prerenal vs ATN from recent hypotension.  Also to
   consider are other intrarenal causes such as AIN or postrenal
   obstruction.  UA was moderately positive with 3-5 WBC, few back, and
   small leuk.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with
   her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
   - Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 26.9.
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She presents from her nursing home with sepsis, likely pulmonary in origin. The patient is currently in the ICU, where she is being treated for sepsis and pneumonia. She has multiple medical complications including acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe immune response to an infection. If not properly managed, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease if not treated promptly and effectively.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient's irregular heartbeat puts her at risk for blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. Proper management of AF is crucial to prevent these complications.

4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues. Treatment is necessary to address the underlying cause and improve oxygenation.

5. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels indicate pre-existing kidney dysfunction. This condition increases the risk of further kidney damage and requires ongoing monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's disease, hypothyroidism, pneumonia, and sepsis. She is currently in the ICU and has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 130/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with an irregular rhythm. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. Imaging and microbiology results are negative for Legionella and DFA. The patient's condition is improving, but there are potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's age and underlying respiratory issues, she may be at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and low blood pressure indicate possible cardiovascular complications. Close monitoring of her heart rhythm and blood pressure is essential to prevent any cardiac events.
3. Renal Complications: The elevated creatinine level suggests potential renal impairment, which could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Pt currently off of Levophed will continue to monitor fluid status
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn as the patient
   is being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr is currently
   trending down towards baseline from 3.7 to 2.5 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to
   1.3) likely pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with
   her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
   - Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
   - Will increase beta blocker therapy to 25mg Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg
   TID
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 26.9.
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.
   # Comm:  Daughter and HCP [**Name (NI) 2052**] [**Name (NI) 4343**]

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA). She presents from her nursing home with sepsis and is currently admitted to the ICU. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including sepsis/PNA, acute on chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hyperparathyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/PNA: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis and PNA. It is important to continue monitoring her vital signs, blood cultures, and administer appropriate antibiotics.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending down towards baseline, indicating improvement. However, it is necessary to continue IVF as previously ordered and trend her creatinine levels. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins should also be continued.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been noted to have atrial fibrillation. Monitoring on telemetry should be continued, and rate control measures should be discussed with the family. Anticoagulation therapy should be considered, and an increase in beta-blocker therapy may be warranted.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are low, indicating anemia. Keeping an type and screen is recommended, and further evaluation of the anemia is necessary.

5. Alzheimer's Disease: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as need to maintain MAP > 65.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr, however will
   need to balance fluid resuscitation with her respiratory status as she
   is DNI and now requiring a NRB.
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures.  Sputum cx contaminated, should send
   another.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.6
   (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely pre-renal
   given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Continue increased beta blocker at 25mg Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg TID
   - Continue heparin gtt for anticoagulation per her primary
   cardiologist.  Will discuss starting coumadin for long-term
   anticoagulation.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 22.7( from 25.5)
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Given her need for pressors/sepsis and Hct drop will transfuse one
   unit PRBC and check a post transfusion Hct.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  NPO given recent aspiration
- Speech and swallow had seen the patient on [**1-25**] and recommended soft solids an
d nectral thick liquids.  Will need reevaluation.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - NPO given recurrent aspiration.  Will have meeting with her daughter
   to discuss goals of care and possible placement of a feeding tube.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - Continue levophed as need to maintain MAP > 65.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures.  Sputum cx contaminated, should send
   another.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 22.7( from 25.5)
   - Keep an type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for Hct
   < 21.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.6
   (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely pre-renal
   given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Hold beta blocker given hypotension and pressor requirement.
   - DC heparin gtt given her Hct drop.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Hold her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone for now
   as NPO.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine, will change to IV.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Stopping Ca and Vit D for now given aspiration risk.
   # FEN:  NPO given recent aspiration. Family meeting as above to dicuss
   goals of care and possible feeding tube placement.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's disease, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA). She presents from her nursing home with sepsis. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, suggesting a likely pulmonary source of infection given the infiltrates seen on chest X-ray. She was given additional intravenous fluids (IVF) and started on levophed for low mean arterial pressures (MAPs). The patient also has a central line in place, and her central venous pressure (CVP) was found to be ranging from 7-4. She has been experiencing recurrent aspiration, leading to the decision of making her NPO (nothing by mouth) and considering possible placement of a feeding tube. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been dropping, and she is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate a possible severe infection, which can lead to sepsis and pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, but the patient remains febrile and hypotensive, indicating a potential ongoing infection.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been decreasing, indicating acute on chronic renal failure. This requires close monitoring and potential blood transfusion if"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - NPO given recurrent aspiration.  Will have meeting with her daughter
   to discuss goals of care and possible placement of a feeding tube.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - Continue levophed as need to maintain MAP > 65.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures.  Sputum cx contaminated, should send
   another.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 22.7( from 25.5)
   - Keep an type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for Hct
   < 21.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.6
   (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely pre-renal
   given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Hold beta blocker given hypotension and pressor requirement.
   - DC heparin gtt given her Hct drop.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Hold her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone for now
   as NPO.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine, will change to IV.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Stopping Ca and Vit D for now given aspiration risk.
   # FEN:  NPO given recent aspiration. Family meeting as above to dicuss

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA). She presents from her nursing home with sepsis and pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She is experiencing recurrent aspiration and has a low hemoglobin level (Hct 22.7). Her blood cultures have shown negative results, and she has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam). The patient is also being treated with vasopressors (Levophed) to maintain adequate blood pressure and cardiac output. Her atrial fibrillation is being managed with anticoagulation, and her other medical conditions, including anemia, acute renal failure, and hyperparathyroidism, are being addressed accordingly. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status and has been discussed with her daughter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's history of Alzheimer's dementia and recurrent aspiration episodes, there is a risk of developing recurrent aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
2. Hypotension and shock: The patient's low blood pressure (101/44 mmHg) indicates hypotension, which may increase the risk of developing shock."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of dementia, currently admitted to the ICU for likely aspiration pneumonitis and persistent altered mental status. She has been affected by SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) and atrial fibrillation, showing some improvement with significant elevation in central venous pressure (CVP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has likely developed aspiration pneumonia due to her altered mental status, which increases the risk of aspiration. Antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) have been started, and a video swallow study is suggested to assess her ability to swallow safely.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure. Heparin has been initiated after discussion with the outpatient cardiologist, but due to the presence of occult blood in stool and decreased hematocrit, concerns have been raised about the risk of bleeding, leading to a decision to hold anticoagulation. Rate control measures will continue.
3. Dementia: The patient's dementia requires special considerations, including ensuring adequate oral intake for medication administration and monitoring for any additional complications.
4. Sepsis: The patient is characterized as having sepsis with hypotension (not shock), and efforts are being made to maintain euvolemia and wean off pressors. Antibiotics are ongoing"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - Nectar thickened liquids per S&S but awaiting video swallow study
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx.  Blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC
   in pairs/chains
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.
   - Keep an type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for Hct
   < 21.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely
   pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Hold beta blocker given hypotension and pressor requirement.
   - DC heparin gtt given her Hct drop.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Were holding her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone
   while NPO but should restart.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine, will change to IV.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Continue Ca and Vit D since no longer NPO.
   # FEN:  Nectar thickened diet. Family meeting as above to dicuss goals
   of care and possible feeding tube placement.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She was admitted from her nursing home with sepsis and presented with leukocytosis and tachycardia in the emergency department. The likely source of infection is pulmonary, given the presence of infiltrates on chest X-ray and a slightly positive urine analysis. She was given additional intravenous fluids and started on levophed for low mean arterial pressures, even with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-4. Urinary Legionella returned negative. The patient aspirated during lunch and later became hypotensive with decreased urine output. IVF had minimal impact on her systolic blood pressure, so levophed was restarted.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Pneumonia:  The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.  Was seen
   to aspirate during lunch on [**1-27**] and later became hypotenisve to the
   80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on her SBP so levophed
   was restarted.  One blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC in pairs/chains.
   Clinically appears to be improving but low grade fevers overnight
   concerning for repeat aspiration vs bacteremia (unlikely)
   - On nectar thickened liquids per S&S but consider making NPO pending
   video swallow study
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx., blood cx.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Sepsis:  Initially met SIRS criteria with keukocytosis and
   tachycardia in ED.  Source of infection is pneumonia.  Blood pressure
   has stabilized.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.  CHADS score of 2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Have restarted low dose metoprolol for rate control
   - No longer on heparin gtt or aspirin given her Hct drop.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.  Still having guaiac
   positive stools, however.
   - Send q3d type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for
   Hct < 21.
   - bleeding is of unclear etiology and ddx includes neoplasm, AVMs,
   ulcers, gastritis.  Colonoscopy as outpatient provided Hct remains
   stable.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   on [**1-28**] from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3)
   likely pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Restarted home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone while
   NPO
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Continue Ca and Vit D since no longer NPO.
   # FEN:  Was on nectar thickened diet but NPO for now. Family meeting as
   above to discuss goals of care and possible feeding tube placement.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.
   # Comm:  Daughter and HCP [**Name (NI) 2052**] [**Name (NI) 4343**]

   Disposition:  ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She presents from her nursing home with sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.9°C (100.3°F)
- Heart Rate: 115 bpm
- Blood Pressure: 127/57 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 21 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 97% on face tent

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, Alzheimer's disease, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and is DNR/DNI.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, likely caused by aspiration given the infiltrates seen on chest X-ray. She also has leukocytosis and tachycardia, which meet SIRS criteria. There is a concern for recurrent aspiration or a post-obstructive process.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia in the ED. The source of infection is pneumonia. Her blood pressure has stabilized, but she may require continued monitoring and management of her CVP.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's Dementia, admitted to the ICU for sepsis and complicated by atrial fibrillation. She has a resting tachycardia with atrial fibrillation as her rhythm and mental status has returned to baseline. The patient's sepsis likely has a pulmonary source, with one positive blood culture persisting. She appears to be volume replete and may benefit from diuretics. The patient also has aspiration pneumonia, for which she will continue with supervised intake only and complete her antibiotic course. Other medical conditions include impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, dementia, hypotension, and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis requires close monitoring and management. Potential complications may include organ dysfunction, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation, which can lead to stroke or other embolic events. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent these complications.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's impaired swallowing function and dementia increase the risk of aspiration. Complications such as worsening respiratory status and pneumonia can occur if proper feeding techniques are not followed.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: Pressure ulcers or bedsores can develop due to prolonged immobility and impaired skin integrity."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Pneumonia:  The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.  Was seen
   to aspirate during lunch on [**1-27**] and later became hypotenisve to the
   80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on her SBP so levophed
   was restarted.  One blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC in pairs/chains.
   Clinically appears to be improving, though she was called out on [**1-29**]
   but was hypoxic on arrival.  Resolved spontaneously and is now satting
   well on 4L.
   - On nectar thickened liquids; family understands her risk of
   aspiration but agree that he is not to return to ICU if she becomes
   hypoxic.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx., blood cx.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Consider coverage for Linezolid given single blood cx growing VRE on
   [**1-26**] if patient spikes or clinically worsens; also pull left subclavian
   once PICC placed
   # Sepsis:  Initially met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in ED.  Source of infection is pneumonia.  Blood pressure
   has stabilized.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.  CHADS score of 2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Have restarted low dose metoprolol for rate control
   - No longer on heparin gtt or aspirin given her Hct drop.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.  Still having guaiac
   positive stools, however.
   - Send q3d type and screen.
   - bleeding is of unclear etiology and ddx includes neoplasm, AVMs,
   ulcers, gastritis.  Colonoscopy as outpatient provided Hct remains
   stable.
   - transfuse for Hct<21
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   on [**1-28**] from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3)
   likely pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Restarted home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone while
   NPO
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Continue Ca and Vit D since no longer NPO.
   # FEN:  On nectar thickened diet and family has agreed that patient
   will not return to ICU if aspirates; they are aware of results of her
   video swallow study
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.
   # Comm:  Daughter and HCP [**Name (NI) 2052**] [**Name (NI) 4343**]

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Pneumonia:  The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.  Was seen
   to aspirate during lunch on [**1-27**] and later became hypotenisve to the
   80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on her SBP so levophed
   was restarted.  One blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC in pairs/chains.
   Clinically appears to be improving but low grade fevers overnight
   concerning for repeat aspiration vs bacteremia (unlikely)
   - On nectar thickened liquids per S&S but consider making NPO pending
   video swallow study
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx., blood cx.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Sepsis:  Initially met SIRS criteria with keukocytosis and
   tachycardia in ED.  Source of infection is pneumonia.  Blood pressure
   has stabilized.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.  CHADS score of 2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Have restarted low dose metoprolol for rate control
   - No longer on heparin gtt or aspirin given her Hct drop.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.  Still having guaiac
   positive stools, however.
   - Send q3d type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for
   Hct < 21.
   - bleeding is of unclear etiology and ddx includes neoplasm, AVMs,
   ulcers, gastritis.  Colonoscopy as outpatient provided Hct remains
   stable.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   on [**1-28**] from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3)
   likely pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Restarted home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone while
   NPO
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Continue Ca and Vit D since no longer NPO.
   # FEN:  Was on nectar thickened diet but NPO for now. Family meeting as
   above to discuss goals of care and possible feeding tube placement.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She presents from her nursing home with sepsis and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, Alzheimer's disease, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and difficulty with feeding. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and there is a family meeting planned to discuss goals of care and possible feeding tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a likely pulmonary source of infection given the infiltrates seen on the chest X-ray. She is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (levofloxacin and vancomycin), but may require adjustment based on culture results.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia in the ED. Her blood pressure has stabilized, but she still requires close monitoring of her central venous pressure (CVP) to maintain it between 8-12. She is no longer on levophed.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation on her ED EKG. She does not appear to have a history of atrial fibrillation. Her outpatient cardiologist decided to start"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with admission with h/o dementia now with likely pneumonia
   and course compliacted by atrial fibrilllation and intermittent
   tachycardia.  There has been significant concern for recurrent
   aspiration across time but no witnessed events yesterday to explain the
   recurrent hypoxemia seen on the medical floor.  There is, however,
   suggestion of increased opacity in right lung field which may be
   hydrostatic edema and/or pneumonitis.
IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   -Continue with ABX in the setting of improved WBC count and continued
   stability of oxygenation outside of the acute event.
   -Continue Vanco/Zosyn and follow for fevers or return of positive
   cultures
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -rate control as needed
   -Will hold on anticoagulation at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of dementia, currently admitted to the ICU. She presented with altered mental status and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing recurrent hypoxemia, which was initially suspected to be due to aspiration events but has not been witnessed. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and has shown some improvement in her WBC count. However, there is concern for possible hydrostatic edema and/or pneumonitis in the right lung field.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged bed rest, poor nutrition, or limited mobility. This increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms suggest a possible infection in the lungs, specifically pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory complications and worsening of the hypoxemia.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation, which can cause an irregular heartbeat and increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs and may contribute to organ dysfunction.
5. Dementia: The patient's pre-existing dementia may worsen during her hospital stay due to factors such as medication side effects, delirium, or changes in her environment."
