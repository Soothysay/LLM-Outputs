","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided progress note. However, based on the information given, there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing an altered mental status, which could be due to various factors such as infection, medication side effects, or electrolyte imbalances.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels (hyperkalemia), which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other serious complications if not managed properly.

3. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, although it is mentioned that it is not in shock. Hypotension can still pose a risk for inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

4. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, specifically alcoholic cirrhosis. This condition can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, and an increased risk of infections.

5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results indicate several electrolyte imbalances, including low sodium (Na+), low potassium (K+), high chloride (Cl-), high bicarbonate (HCO3-), and low blood urea nitrogen (BUN). These imbalances can affect various bodily functions and need to be corrected.

6. Infections: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count (WBC) may suggest an ongoing infection. In the ICU setting"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver and alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and hyperkalemia. The patient is currently on multiple medications including norepinephrine, insulin, dextrose, heparin, and various antibiotics. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.8Â°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 116/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 19 mmHg, with fluid balance indicating an intake of 7,873 mL and output of 2,735 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,138 mL. The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels (K+ of 5.2 mEq/L), low albumin (2.0 g/dL), and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST of 23/47). The patient has a history of hypotension but is not in shock. The patient's neurological status is not assessed, and peripheral pulses are not evaluated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: Despite the patient being described as having altered mental status rather than delirium, it is important to closely monitor the patient's cognitive function due to the risk of delirium in the ICU setting.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here for ARFlikely [**12-22**] hypovolumia / ATN and/or HRS.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Suspect that this is [**12-22**] her new uremia, although her hepatic disease
   could be a contributor as well. She underwent a STAT head CT to assess
   for bleed in the setting of her recent falls.
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)/ARF
   The etiology of her ARF is not entirely clear. Her sediment was
   reviewed by the Renal team and reportedly there were no muddy brown
   casts or findings c/w a glomerulonephritic process. ATN is a
   possibility, although the absence of muddy brown casts make that less
   likely as a primary cause of her ARF. Hepatorenal syndrome is a
   distinct possibility given her comorbid liver disease, although her
   FeNa is 24. Would provide albumin boluses this morning to further
   assess if she has any response to a further volume challenge.
   Anticipate providing midodrine / octreotide today if she does not
   meaninfully respond. The pace of her renal failure is not consistent
   with a chronic cause such as her underlying DM. An obstructive
   possibility seems quite unlikely given she has a foley; however, we
   will request a renal U/S to assess definitively for hydronephrosis.
   Understand that she is to have a HD line placed today; will t/b with IR
   regarding potentially having Anesthesia provide procedural assistance /
   sedation. She may need to have her access placed here in the MICU given
   her tenuous overall status.
 .H/O HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Her SBP has ranged in the 80-100s here, this is close to her
baseline.
 In the acute setting, we will hold her Nadolol and
   diuretics.  She appears clinically volume deplete (collapsing IJ by U/S
   with inspiration) so we will continue to volume challenge her with IVF
   and albumin.
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   Rifaximin, lactulose, and follow Liver recs. Hold Lasix anad
   spironolactone. Abdominal U/S today to assess for portal vein
   thrombosis or other acute findings. Paracentesis without e/o SBP.
   Negative EtOH level on admission.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes who was admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure (ARF). She had previous hospitalizations for anasarca and shortness of breath (SOB), and underwent two paracentesis procedures. She also experienced hyponatremia during her hospitalization. Her current condition includes altered mental status, hyperkalemia, hypotension, cirrhosis of the liver, acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): This is a distinct possibility given her comorbid liver disease. HRS is characterized by renal failure in the setting of severe liver disease without another apparent cause for kidney dysfunction. The patient's feNa (fractional excretion of sodium) is 24, which supports the diagnosis of HRS.

2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): ATN is a possibility as well, although the absence of muddy brown casts makes it less likely as a primary cause of her ARF. ATN can occur due to ischemia or nephrotoxicity, and it is characterized by acute kidney injury with a sudden decrease in renal function.

3. Obstructive uropathy: Although obstructive causes seem unlikely, the patient's Foley catheter may not be sufficient to rule out hydroneph"

   HPI:
    56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here with ARF.
   She was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 19**]-[**Location (un) 250**] for anasarca and SOB. She
   underwent two paracenteses. Was found to have hyponatremia in the low
   130s. On [**8-13**] her creatinine was 1.3. [**8-21**] her creatinine was 3.9 at
   her PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office, this was thought to be [**12-22**] her having gotten new
   diuretics during her hospitalization. On [**8-27**] she returned with new
   falls, her sodium was 140, bicarb 14, BUN 130, creatinine 7.8. She was
   sent to the ER where her SBP was in the 70-90s and she was satting
   well. She received kayexalate, IVF (2L NS), insulin 10 units / D50, and
   bicarb for a K of 7.3. She was sent to our ED.
   Here she was noted to have SOB with a sat of 99% on 15L NC. She was
   becoming encephalopathic and a NG tube was placed. A diagnostic
   paracentesis was performed and was negative for SBP. Her K was 6.7. A
   foley was placed with ~200cc of urine. She was admitted to the medical
   floor, where on arrival she triggered for being obtunded (arousable
   only to sternal rub.) She was A&O x 1. Her SBP was as low at 70,
   improved to 100-110s with a small bolus. EKG without acute
   abnormalities. She received lactulose, rifaxamin, insulin / D50, and a

   Assessment and Plan
   56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here for ARFlikely [**12-22**] hypovolumia / ATN and/or HRS.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Suspect that this is [**12-22**] her new uremia, although her hepatic disease
   could be a contributor as well. She underwent a STAT head CT to assess
   for bleed in the setting of her recent falls, which was negative for
   anything acute.  More awake over last 24 hours, and oriented x 3 this
   morning.  Continue lactulose, and should improve with resolution of
   uremia.
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)/ARF
   The etiology of her ARF is not entirely clear. Her sediment was
   reviewed by the Renal team and reportedly there were no muddy brown
   casts or findings c/w a glomerulonephritic process. ATN is a
   possibility, although the absence of muddy brown casts make that less
   likely as a primary cause of her ARF. Hepatorenal syndrome is a
   distinct possibility given her comorbid liver disease, although her
   FeNa is 24. Would provide albumin boluses this morning to further
   assess if she has any response to a further volume challenge. Now
   improving significantly, so will hold off on midodrine/octreotide for
   now.  UOP much improved, creat trending down.   Checking lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
 .H/O HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Her SBP has ranged in the 80-100s here, this is close to her
baseline.
 In the acute setting, we will hold her Nadolol and
   diuretics.  Responding to volume repletion, with BP stabilizing and UOP
   increasing, but still requiring low-dose levophed overnight.  Will try
   to wean levophed to off today, as long as her SBP remains above 90.
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   Rifaximin, lactulose, and follow Liver recs. Hold Lasix anad
   spironolactone. Abdominal U/S [**8-28**] showed portal HTN but no evidence of
   protal vein thrombosis. Paracentesis without e/o SBP. Negative EtOH
   level on admission.
   IINFECTIOUS DISEASE: One set blood cultures with gram positive cocci
   chains and pairs.  Cultures drawn on same day or before line placed, so
   not suspicious for line infection.  Sent surveillance cultures, and
   will continue antibiotics for now.   No SBP, no other infectious source
   identified.  If repeat cultures negative and BP remains stable will D/C
   antibiotics.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO until now.  Will start oral feed as tolerated, with tube
   feeds for extra nutritional support.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes type 2, who was admitted for acute renal failure (ARF). She underwent two paracenteses and was found to have hyponatremia. Her creatinine levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 1.3 to 7.8. She experienced falls and was sent to the emergency room, where her blood pressure (SBP) was in the 70-90s. She received treatment for hyperkalemia, including kayexalate, IV fluids, insulin, and bicarbonate. A diagnostic paracentesis was performed, which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She also had a Foley catheter placed and was admitted to the medical floor. Her mental status deteriorated, and a nasogastric (NG) tube was placed. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

   Assessment and Plan
   56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here for ARFlikely [**12-22**] hypovolumia / ATN and/or HRS.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Suspect that this is [**12-22**] her new uremia, although her hepatic disease
   could be a contributor as well. She underwent a STAT head CT to assess
   for bleed in the setting of her recent falls, which was negative for
   anything acute.  More awake over last 24 hours, and oriented x 3 this
   morning.  Continue lactulose, and should improve with resolution of
   uremia.
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)/ARF
   The etiology of her ARF is not entirely clear. Her sediment was
   reviewed by the Renal team and reportedly there were no muddy brown
   casts or findings c/w a glomerulonephritic process. ATN is a
   possibility, although the absence of muddy brown casts make that less
   likely as a primary cause of her ARF. Hepatorenal syndrome is a
   distinct possibility given her comorbid liver disease, although her
   FeNa is 24. Would provide albumin boluses this morning to further
   assess if she has any response to a further volume challenge. Now
   improving significantly, so will hold off on midodrine/octreotide for
   now.  UOP much improved, creat trending down.   Checking lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
 .H/O HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Her SBP has ranged in the 80-100s here, this is close to her
baseline.
 In the acute setting, we will hold her Nadolol and
   diuretics.  Responding to volume repletion, with BP stabilizing and UOP
   increasing, but still requiring low-dose levophed overnight.  Will try
   to wean levophed to off today, as long as her SBP remains above 90.
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   Rifaximin, lactulose, and follow Liver recs. Hold Lasix anad
   spironolactone. Abdominal U/S [**8-28**] showed portal HTN but no evidence of
   protal vein thrombosis. Paracentesis without e/o SBP. Negative EtOH
   level on admission.
   IINFECTIOUS DISEASE: One set blood cultures with gram positive cocci
   chains and pairs.  Cultures drawn on same day or before line placed, so
   not suspicious for line infection.  Sent surveillance cultures, and
   will continue antibiotics for now.   No SBP, no other infectious source
   identified.  If repeat cultures negative and BP remains stable will D/C
   antibiotics.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO until now.  Will start oral feed as tolerated, with tube
   feeds for extra nutritional support.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted to the ICU for anasarca and shortness of breath. She underwent two paracenteses and was found to have hyponatremia. Her creatinine levels have fluctuated throughout her hospitalization, from 1.3 to 3.9, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The patient presented with new falls, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine 7.8, and hyperkalemia (potassium level of 7.3). She was treated with kayexalate, intravenous fluids, insulin, and bicarbonate. A diagnostic paracentesis was performed, which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). A Foley catheter was placed, and she was admitted to the medical floor. Upon arrival, she became obtunded and required a small bolus to improve her blood pressure. An arterial line was started, and she received lactulose, rifaximin, insulin, and a bicarbonate drip. Her potassium levels have trended down, and her creatinine has improved slightly. She is currently receiving norepinephrine and heparin prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her urine output is good. She has mild hypoxemia but is not on respiratory support. Her recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/55 to 116/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube and has been placed on norepinephrine infusion to maintain blood pressure. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin levels, and signs of renal dysfunction with an elevated creatinine level. The patient also has evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by an elevated ammonia level. Electrolyte imbalances include hyperkalemia (high potassium), hyponatremia (low sodium), and hypomagnesemia (low magnesium). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's elevated ammonia levels suggest hepatic encephalopathy, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by liver dysfunction. It can lead to altered mental status, confusion, and even coma.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level and reduced urine output indicate renal dysfunction. If not managed appropriately, AKI can progress to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of EtOH-induced cirrhosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was hospitalized previously for anasarca and shortness of breath, underwent two paracentesis, and was found to have hyponatremia. Her creatinine levels were 1.3 on [**8-13**] and 3.9 at her primary care physician's office. On [**8-27**], she returned with new falls, and her sodium level was 140, bicarb 14, BUN 130, and creatinine 7.8. She was sent to the ER where she had a systolic blood pressure in the 70-90s and was saturating well. She received kayexalate, IV fluids, insulin/D50, and bicarb for a potassium level of 7.3. She was then admitted to the medical floor, where she triggered for being obtunded but later became alert and oriented. Her SBP improved from 70 to 100-110s with a small bolus. An EKG showed no acute abnormalities. She received lactulose, rifaxamin, insulin/D50, and a bicarb gtt. ABG results showed a pH of 7.5, PaCO2 of 22, HCO3 of 14, Na of 146, and K of 14. She was transferred to the MICU. Her potassium level has been trending down from 6.0 to 5.8 to 5.3 in our hospital. Her creatinine levels have been 1.3, 3.5, 7.8, and 7.3 (6:45PM, [**8-27**]) and 7.7 (3AM, [**8-28**]). She has had good urine output in the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is currently experiencing altered mental status, which can be a sign of hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, and she has been diagnosed with ARF.
3. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's systolic blood pressure has been ranging from 70-110s, indicating hypotension.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels have been consistently elevated, indicating hyperkalemia.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and the presence of an arterial line may suggest an ongoing infection.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and she requires supplemental oxygen, which could indicate underlying respiratory complications.

Please note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm them."

   Assessment and Plan
   56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here for ARFlikely [**12-22**] hypovolumia / ATN and/or HRS.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Suspect that this is [**12-22**] her new uremia, although her hepatic disease
   could be a contributor as well. She underwent a STAT head CT to assess
   for bleed in the setting of her recent falls.
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)/ARF
   The etiology of her ARF is not entirely clear. Her sediment was
   reviewed by the Renal team and reportedly there were no muddy brown
   casts or findings c/w a glomerulonephritic process. ATN is a
   possibility, although the absence of muddy brown casts make that less
   likely as a primary cause of her ARF. Hepatorenal syndrome is a
   distinct possibility given her comorbid liver disease, although her
   FeNa is 24. Would provide albumin boluses this morning to further
   assess if she has any response to a further volume challenge.
   Anticipate providing midodrine / octreotide today if she does not
   meaninfully respond. The pace of her renal failure is not consistent
   with a chronic cause such as her underlying DM. An obstructive
   possibility seems quite unlikely given she has a foley; however, we
   will request a renal U/S to assess definitively for hydronephrosis.
   Understand that she is to have a HD line placed today; will t/b with IR
   regarding potentially having Anesthesia provide procedural assistance /
   sedation. She may need to have her access placed here in the MICU given
   her tenuous overall status.
 .H/O HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Her SBP has ranged in the 80-100s here, this is close to her
baseline.
 In the acute setting, we will hold her Nadolol and
   diuretics.  She appears clinically volume deplete (collapsing IJ by U/S
   with inspiration) so we will continue to volume challenge her with IVF
   and albumin.
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   Rifaximin, lactulose, and follow Liver recs. Hold Lasix anad
   spironolactone. Abdominal U/S today to assess for portal vein
   thrombosis or other acute findings. Paracentesis without e/o SBP.
   Negative EtOH level on admission.

    56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here with ARF.
   She was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 19**]-[**Location (un) 250**] for anasarca and SOB. She
   underwent two paracenteses. Was found to have hyponatremia in the low
   130s. On [**8-13**] her creatinine was 1.3. [**8-21**] her creatinine was 3.9 at
   her PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office, this was thought to be [**12-22**] her having gotten new
   diuretics during her hospitalization. On [**8-27**] she returned with new
   falls, her sodium was 140, bicarb 14, BUN 130, creatinine 7.8. She was
   sent to the ER where her SBP was in the 70-90s and she was satting
   well. She received kayexalate, IVF (2L NS), insulin 10 units / D50, and
   bicarb for a K of 7.3. She was sent to our ED.
   Here she was noted to have SOB with a sat of 99% on 15L NC. She was
   becoming encephalopathic and a NG tube was placed. A diagnostic
   paracentesis was performed and was negative for SBP. Her K was 6.7. A
   foley was placed with ~200cc of urine. She was admitted to the medical
   floor, where on arrival she triggered for being obtunded (arousable
   only to sternal rub.) She was A&O x 1. Her SBP was as low at 70,
   improved to 100-110s with a small bolus. EKG without acute
   abnormalities. She received lactulose, rifaxamin, insulin / D50, and a
   bicarb gtt. ABG 7.5 / 22/ 146 /14. She was transferred to the MICU.
   Her potassium trend has been 6.0

   Assessment and Plan
   56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here for ARFlikely [**12-22**] hypovolumia / ATN and/or HRS.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Suspect that this is [**12-22**] her new uremia, although her hepatic disease
   could be a contributor as well. She underwent a STAT head CT to assess
   for bleed in the setting of her recent falls, which was negative for
   anything acute.  More awake over last 24 hours, but still
   encephalopathic.
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)/ARF
   The etiology of her ARF is not entirely clear. Her sediment was
   reviewed by the Renal team and reportedly there were no muddy brown
   casts or findings c/w a glomerulonephritic process. ATN is a
   possibility, although the absence of muddy brown casts make that less
   likely as a primary cause of her ARF. Hepatorenal syndrome is a
   distinct possibility given her comorbid liver disease, although her
   FeNa is 24. Would provide albumin boluses this morning to further
   assess if she has any response to a further volume challenge. Now
   improving significantly, so will hold off on midodrine/octreotide for
   now.  UOP much improved
 .H/O HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Her SBP has ranged in the 80-100s here, this is close to her
baseline.
 In the acute setting, we will hold her Nadolol and
   diuretics.  Responding to volume repletion, with BP stabilizing and UOP
   increasing, but still requiring low-dose levophed overnight.  Will try
   to wean levophed to off today, as long as her SBP remains above 90.
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   Rifaximin, lactulose, and follow Liver recs. Hold Lasix anad
   spironolactone. Abdominal U/S [**8-28**] showed portal HTN but no evidence of
   protal vein thrombosis. Paracentesis without e/o SBP. Negative EtOH
   level on admission.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted to the ICU for anasarca and shortness of breath. She underwent two paracenteses and was found to have hyponatremia. Her creatinine levels have fluctuated from 1.3 to 7.8, indicating acute kidney injury (ARF). She presented with new falls, electrolyte imbalances, and encephalopathy, and was given kayexalate, intravenous fluids, insulin, and bicarbonate. A diagnostic paracentesis showed no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient was admitted to the medical floor, where she became obtunded but responded to a small bolus of fluids. She was transferred to the MICU with ongoing potassium fluctuations and worsening renal function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): Given the patient's comorbid liver disease and the absence of muddy brown casts or findings suggestive of glomerulonephritis, HRS is a distinct possibility.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): Although the absence of muddy brown casts makes primary ATN less likely, it cannot be completely ruled out as a cause of the ARF.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels pose a risk of cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's encephalopathy and recent falls may indicate a neurological complication.
5. Hypotension: Despite having a stable blood pressure range of 80-100s, the patient requires low-dose levophed overnight, indicating potential ongoing hemodynamic instability.
6. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient's history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis increases the risk of complications such as variceal bleeds, portal hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The fluctuating creatinine levels indicate the patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of low JVP on ultrasound, which was initially thought to be hypovolemic shock. The patient received 5L IVF, underwent temporary dialysis with VIP port placement, and showed improvement in urine output. Broad antibiotics were started, and the patient was placed on levophed for BP support. An alkaline infusion was also initiated, and phosphate was managed with aluminum hydroxide. An abdominal ultrasound did not perform dopplers, but a TEE revealed collapsing RV and LVOF obstruction. The patient's chest X-ray showed a 9th rib fracture. No known drug allergies were reported.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, cirrhosis of the liver, and hepatic encephalopathy. He presented to the ICU with hypotension, altered mental status, and signs of renal failure. He was initially on levophed support but was weaned off. The patient has been receiving vancomycin and cefepime empirically. His creatinine levels are trending down without the initiation of dialysis. He has a positive MRSA screen and pending blood cultures. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 105/55 mmHg and a heart rate of 93 bpm. His respiratory rate is 8 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's extremities show 3+ edema bilaterally. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, leading to pneumonia.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy puts him at risk for further deterioration in mental status.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and fluid balance indicate acute renal failure, which may progress if not managed appropriately.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholism, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, and acute renal failure. He was admitted to the ICU due to complications from cirrhosis, including hepatic encephalopathy, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently on vasopressor support and has been off of levophed since coming off of it. His creatinine levels are trending down without initiation of dialysis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 105/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, soft and distended abdomen, clear breath sounds, and no peripheral pulses assessed in the upper or lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels. Urine culture results are pending, and the patient has tested positive for MRSA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient has an inability to protect his airway, putting him at risk for aspiration and subsequent respiratory complications.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of alcoholism and cirrhosis, which increases the risk of hepatic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, presenting with acute renal failure, shock/hypotension, and an unknown source of infection. She has been on vasopressor support and aggressive diuretics, but her condition remains unstable. The patient also has hepatic encephalopathy, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hematuria, diabetes, alcoholism, and requires nutrition support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to alcoholic cirrhosis and she is on immunosuppressive medications. This increases the risk of various infections, including hospital-acquired infections.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can worsen if the patient's liver function deteriorates further or if there is an accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys may continue to deteriorate, leading to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may continue to be unstable, necessitating ongoing vasopressor support.
5. Malnutrition: The patient may develop nutritional deficiencies due to inadequate intake, which can impair wound healing and increase the risk of infections.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and altered coagulation status can predispose the patient to DVT.

   DM type 2 here with ARF.
   She was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 19**]-[**Location (un) 250**] for anasarca and SOB. She
   underwent two paracenteses. Was found to have hyponatremia in the low
   130s. On [**8-13**] her creatinine was 1.3. [**8-21**] her creatinine was 3.9 at
   her PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office, this was thought to be [**12-22**] her having gotten new
   diuretics during her hospitalization. On [**8-27**] she returned with new
   falls, her sodium was 140, bicarb 14, BUN 130, creatinine 7.8. She was
   sent to the ER where her SBP was in the 70-90s and she was satting
   well. She received kayexalate, IVF (2L NS), insulin 10 units / D50, and
   bicarb for a K of 7.3. She was sent to our ED.
   Here she was noted to have SOB with a sat of 99% on 15L NC. She was
   becoming encephalopathic and a NG tube was placed. A diagnostic
   paracentesis was performed and was negative for SBP. Her K was 6.7. A
   foley was placed with ~200cc of urine. She was admitted to the medical
   floor, where on arrival she triggered for being obtunded (arousable
   only to sternal rub.) She was A&O x 1. Her SBP was as low at 70,
   improved to 100-110s with a small bolus. EKG without acute
   abnormalities. She received lactulose, rifaxamin, insulin / D50, and a

   Assessment and Plan
   56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here for ARFlikely [**12-22**] hypovolumia / ATN and/or HRS.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Suspect that this is [**12-22**] her new uremia, although her hepatic disease
   could be a contributor as well. She underwent a STAT head CT to assess
   for bleed in the setting of her recent falls, which was negative for
   anything acute. Mental status much improved. Oriented x 3.  No
   asterixis today on exam.  Will decrease lastulose, titrate to bowel
   movements.
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)/ARF
   The etiology of her ARF is not entirely clear. Her sediment was
   reviewed by the Renal team and reportedly there were no muddy brown
   casts or findings c/w a glomerulonephritic process. ATN is a
   possibility, although the absence of muddy brown casts make that less
   likely as a primary cause of her ARF. Hepatorenal syndrome is a
   distinct possibility given her comorbid liver disease.  Her creatinine
   continues to improve, although somewhat slowly. High UOP,
   autodiuresing.  HD catheter still in, but will talk to renal to see if
   we can remove it.  Na slightly up today.  Will recheck at 5pm.
 .H/O HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Her SBP has ranged in the 80-100s here, this is close to her
baseline.
 In the acute setting, we will hold her Nadolol and
   diuretics.  Responding to volume repletion, with BP stabilizing and UOP
   increasing, but still requiring low-dose levophed overnight.  Will try
   to wean levophed to off today, as long as her SBP remains above 90.
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   Rifaximin, lactulose, and follow Liver recs. Hold Lasix anad
   spironolactone. Abdominal U/S [**8-28**] showed portal HTN but no evidence of
   protal vein thrombosis. Paracentesis without e/o SBP. Negative EtOH
   level on admission. Decreasing lactulose.  Too early to restart
   diuretics.
   IINFECTIOUS DISEASE: One set blood cultures with gram positive cocci
   chains and pairs.  Cultures drawn on same day or before line placed, so
   not suspicious for line infection.  Sent surveillance cultures, and
   will continue antibiotics for now.   No SBP, no other infectious source
   identified.  If repeat cultures negative and BP remains stable will D/C
   antibiotics.

   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed her hospital course and
   was present for the key portions of the services provided.  I have
   reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note above and agree with her findings and plan of
   care.  The patient has improved very considerably from MICU admission
   and is now oriented and quite alert and interactive.  Her creatinine is
   still 5 but decreasing.  She
s hemodynamically stable off pressors, and
   without leukocytosis on Vanco and Cefepime.  She remains on lactulose
   and soon will be restarted on Nadolol.  All in all she is stable for
   transfer to the floor and has been called out.

","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of EtOH-induced cirrhosis complicated by variceal bleeds, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus who is currently experiencing acute renal failure (ARF). She has been hospitalized multiple times and has undergone paracentesis. She presented with anasarca and shortness of breath (SOB), and her creatinine levels were initially elevated. 

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient was encephalopathic and had a low blood sodium level. She received treatment for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but diagnostic paracentesis was negative for SBP. The patient's potassium level was also low. A Foley catheter was placed, and she was given lactulose, rifaximin, insulin/D50, and bicarbonate. 

The patient's renal function and electrolyte imbalances are now improving. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, with an oxygen saturation of 100%. Her blood pressure is stable in the 80-100 range. 

The patient's history of cirrhosis and alcohol abuse raises concerns for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) as a potential cause of her ARF. The absence of muddy brown casts suggests that acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is less likely. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of liver function, further electrolyte disturbances, development of sepsis, and potential worsening of renal function if not closely monitored."

   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here with ARF.
   She was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 19**]-[**Location (un) 250**] for anasarca and SOB. She
   underwent two paracenteses. Was found to have hyponatremia in the low
   130s. On [**8-13**] her creatinine was 1.3. [**8-21**] her creatinine was 3.9 at
   her PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office, this was thought to be [**12-22**] her having gotten new
   diuretics during her hospitalization. On [**8-27**] she returned with new
   falls, her sodium was 140, bicarb 14, BUN 130, creatinine 7.8. She was
   sent to the ER where her SBP was in the 70-90s and she was satting
   well. She received kayexalate, IVF (2L NS), insulin 10 units / D50, and
   bicarb for a K of 7.3. She was sent to our ED.
   Here she was noted to have SOB with a sat of 99% on 15L NC. She was
   becoming encephalopathic and a NG tube was placed. A diagnostic
   paracentesis was performed and was negative for SBP. Her K was 6.7. A
   foley was placed with ~200cc of urine. She was admitted to the medical
   floor, where on arrival she triggered for being obtunded (arousable
   only to sternal rub.) She was A&O x 1. Her SBP was as low at 70,
   improved to 100-110s with a small bolus. EKG without acute
   abnormalities. She received lactulose, rifaxamin, insulin / D50, and a
   bicarb gtt. ABG 7.5 / 22/ 146 /14. She was transferred to the MICU.
   Renal function and electrolyte imbalance now improving.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of EtOH-induced cirrhosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, admitted for acute renal failure (ARF). She underwent two paracenteses during her previous hospitalization due to anasarca and shortness of breath. Her creatinine levels were initially normal but increased to 3.9 on [**12-22**], which was attributed to new diuretics. She presented again on [**8-27**] with falls, hyponatremia, elevated BUN, and creatinine of 7.8. She was sent to the ER where she received kayexalate, IV fluids, insulin, and bicarbonate. Upon arrival at the ICU, she was noted to have encephalopathy and a nasogastric (NG) tube was placed. Diagnostic paracentesis was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and her potassium level was 6.7. A Foley catheter was inserted, and she was admitted to the medical floor. She triggered for being obtunded upon arrival but responded well to a small bolus of fluids. Electrolyte imbalances and renal function are now improving. The patient has a history of variceal bleeds, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute renal failure (ARF) and encephalopathy. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and medications. The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, and his review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/54 mmHg to 150/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,228 mL, including 512 mL of IV fluids, 120 mL of PO intake, 306 mL of TF intake, and 1,541 mL of IVF intake. The total output is 4,080 mL, including 2,015 mL of blood products, 2,680 mL of urine output, 1,300 mL of NG output, 1,500 mL of stool output, and 100 mL of drain output. This results in a negative fluid balance of -1,852 mL.

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 26 mmHg, PaO2 of 130 mmHg, HCO3- of 13 mEq/L, and BE of -8.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 8.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.7%, platelet count of 104 K/uL, creatinine of 6.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 112 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels including sodium of 128 mg/dL, potassium of 5.3 mg/dL, chloride of 80 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate of 7.9 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications for this patient include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has an inability to protect the airway, which increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver and elevated creatinine levels indicate the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and other neurological symptoms.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output suggest ARF, which is a critical condition requiring immediate attention.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, which may be due to fluid shifts or decreased cardiac output.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level indicates hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed properly.

6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection, which needs to be evaluated and treated promptly.

7. Liver failure: The patient's history"

   HPI:
    56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here with ARF.
   She was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 19**]-[**Location (un) 250**] for anasarca and SOB. She
   underwent two paracenteses. Was found to have hyponatremia in the low
   130s. On [**8-13**] her creatinine was 1.3. [**8-21**] her creatinine was 3.9 at
   her PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office, this was thought to be [**12-22**] her having gotten new
   diuretics during her hospitalization. On [**8-27**] she returned with new
   falls, her sodium was 140, bicarb 14, BUN 130, creatinine 7.8. She was
   sent to the ER where her SBP was in the 70-90s and she was satting
   well. She received kayexalate, IVF (2L NS), insulin 10 units / D50, and
   bicarb for a K of 7.3. She was sent to our ED.
   Here she was noted to have SOB with a sat of 99% on 15L NC. She was
   becoming encephalopathic and a NG tube was placed. A diagnostic
   paracentesis was performed and was negative for SBP. Her K was 6.7. A
   foley was placed with ~200cc of urine. She was admitted to the medical
   floor, where on arrival she triggered for being obtunded (arousable
   only to sternal rub.) She was A&O x 1. Her SBP was as low at 70,
   improved to 100-110s with a small bolus. EKG without acute
   abnormalities. She received lactulose, rifaxamin, insulin / D50, and a
   bicarb gtt. ABG 7.5 / 22/ 146 /14. She was transferred to the MICU.
   Renal function and electrolyte imbalance now improving.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here for ARFlikely [**12-22**] hypovolumia / ATN and/or HRS.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Suspect that this is [**12-22**] her new uremia, although her hepatic disease
   could be a contributor as well. She underwent a STAT head CT to assess
   for bleed in the setting of her recent falls, which was negative for
   anything acute.  More awake over last 24 hours, and oriented x 3 this
   morning.  Continue lactulose, and should improve with resolution of
   uremia.
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)/ARF
   The etiology of her ARF is not entirely clear. Her sediment was
   reviewed by the Renal team and reportedly there were no muddy brown
   casts or findings c/w a glomerulonephritic process. ATN is a
   possibility, although the absence of muddy brown casts make that less
   likely as a primary cause of her ARF. Hepatorenal syndrome is a
   distinct possibility given her comorbid liver disease, although her
   FeNa is 24. Would provide albumin boluses this morning to further
   assess if she has any response to a further volume challenge. Now
   improving significantly, so will hold off on midodrine/octreotide for
   now.  UOP much improved, creat trending down.   Checking lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
 .H/O HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Her SBP has ranged in the 80-100s here, this is close to her
baseline.
 In the acute setting, we will hold her Nadolol and
   diuretics.  Responding to volume repletion, with BP stabilizing and UOP
   increasing, but still requiring low-dose levophed overnight.  Will try
   to wean levophed to off today, as long as her SBP remains above 90.
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   Rifaximin, lactulose, and follow Liver recs. Hold Lasix anad
   spironolactone. Abdominal U/S [**8-28**] showed portal HTN but no evidence of
   protal vein thrombosis. Paracentesis without e/o SBP. Negative EtOH
   level on admission.
   IINFECTIOUS DISEASE: One set blood cultures with gram positive cocci
   chains and pairs.  Cultures drawn on same day or before line placed, so
   not suspicious for line infection.  Sent surveillance cultures, and
   will continue antibiotics for now.   No SBP, no other infectious source
   identified.  If repeat cultures negative and BP remains stable will D/C
   antibiotics.

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of EtOH-induced cirrhosis, hypertension, and DM type 2, currently admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure (ARF) and encephalopathy. She has been hospitalized previously for anasarca and shortness of breath, undergoing two paracenteses. Her creatinine levels have shown significant fluctuations over the past few weeks.

s on blood culture [**8-28**] (one bottle), repeat set pending
   Assessment and Plan
   56yo woman with a h/o EtOH induced cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeds, HTN,
   DM type 2 here for ARFlikely [**12-22**] hypovolumia / ATN and/or HRS.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Suspect that this is [**12-22**] her new uremia, although her hepatic disease
   could be a contributor as well. She underwent a STAT head CT to assess
   for bleed in the setting of her recent falls, which was negative for
   anything acute. Mental status much improved. Oriented x 3.  No
   asterixis today on exam.  Will decrease lastulose, titrate to bowel
   movements.
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)/ARF
   The etiology of her ARF is not entirely clear. Her sediment was
   reviewed by the Renal team and reportedly there were no muddy brown
   casts or findings c/w a glomerulonephritic process. ATN is a
   possibility, although the absence of muddy brown casts make that less
   likely as a primary cause of her ARF. Hepatorenal syndrome is a
   distinct possibility given her comorbid liver disease.  Her creatinine
   continues to improve, although somewhat slowly. High UOP,
   autodiuresing.  HD catheter still in, but will talk to renal to see if
   we can remove it.  Na slightly up today.  Will recheck at 5pm.
 .H/O HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Her SBP has ranged in the 80-100s here, this is close to her
baseline.
 In the acute setting, we will hold her Nadolol and
   diuretics.  Responding to volume repletion, with BP stabilizing and UOP
   increasing, but still requiring low-dose levophed overnight.  Will try
   to wean levophed to off today, as long as her SBP remains above 90.
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   Rifaximin, lactulose, and follow Liver recs. Hold Lasix anad
   spironolactone. Abdominal U/S [**8-28**] showed portal HTN but no evidence of
   protal vein thrombosis. Paracentesis without e/o SBP. Negative EtOH
   level on admission. Decreasing lactulose.  Too early to restart
   diuretics.
   IINFECTIOUS DISEASE: One set blood cultures with gram positive cocci
   chains and pairs.  Cultures drawn on same day or before line placed, so
   not suspicious for line infection.  Sent surveillance cultures, and
   will continue antibiotics for now.   No SBP, no other infectious source
   identified.  If repeat cultures negative and BP remains stable will D/C
   antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeds, hypertension, and diabetes type 2 who presented with acute renal failure (ARF). She was hospitalized at another hospital for anasarca and shortness of breath, underwent two paracenteses, and was found to have hyponatremia. Her creatinine levels were elevated on multiple occasions, initially thought to be due to new diuretics during her hospitalization. On 08/27, she returned with new falls, normal sodium levels, bicarbonate 14, BUN 130, and creatinine 7.8. She was sent to the emergency room where her systolic blood pressure (SBP) was in the 70-90s, and she received treatment for hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. She was admitted to the medical floor and later transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to altered mental status and encephalopathy. Her renal function and electrolyte imbalance are now improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given her comorbid liver disease, this is a distinct possibility.
2. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): Although the absence of muddy brown casts makes it less likely, it cannot be completely ruled out.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which may require further management.
4. Infection"
