   MICRO: [**2158-9-13**] Hip joint: Ecoli multi drug resistant, sensitive to
   Amikacin, Zosyn
   Assessment and Plan
   49yo woman with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS (MELD 15), recently found to
   have E coli in right hip (with hardware), transferred to the MICU in
   the setting of progressive hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia:
   DDx include volume overload with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar
   hemorrhage (especially given elevated INR and low platelets).  There is
   some evidence to support hepatopulmonary syndrome (hyperdynamic Echo
   with pulm HTN).  Also consider TRALI, although she has received
   platelets after CXR showing alveolar infiltrates.  CT chest negative
   for PE ([**9-12**]).
   - albumin and lasix for diuresis (goal -1.5 L/day)
   - obtain repeat CT chest to further characterize findings on CXR
   - consider bronchoscopy in AM to eval for bleed
   - evaluate for coagulopathy/DIC as discussed below
   - consider TTE with bubble study if above work-up not revealing
   - check ABG in AM
   - sputum Cx; cover possible PNA with vanc/zosyn and Levo for double
   pseudomonas coverage
   - consider arterial line placement after FFP this pm
   # Hip infection:
   Growing resistant E coli; known to have coag negative staph in the
   past.
   - vanc/zosyn
   - appreciate ID and orthopedics input
   - plan per ortho had been to go to OR on Tuesday; will aim to optimize
   respiratory status prior to procedure
   - follow daily BCx
   - f/u read of MRI T/L-spine (unclear why ordered)
   # Coagulopathy:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to worsening liver failure, but INR has been
   increasing above baseline (2.0->2.9).  With dropping platelets and some
   hemoptysis, have concern for DIC.
   - check fibrinogen, FDP, smear
   - type and screen
   - continue vitamin K
   - check D-bilirubin
   # Cirrhosis from Hep C:
   MELD score this stay has been 15-20.  On transplant list.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - trend LFTs
   - appreciate liver recs
   # Anemia:  Current Hct 21, baseline Hct 23-27
   - type and screen
   - hold off on transfusion given respiratory status unless Hct continues
   to drop
   - follow Q8H Hct for now
   # Adrenal insufficiency:
   Consider possibility that septic physiology may be masked by high dose
   steroids.
   - wean steroids to hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q8H for now and Q12 tomorrow.
   - monitor blood sugars for hypoglycemia
   # Hyponatremia:  Na 131 (at baseline)
   - monitor Na with diuresis and [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   #. Pain:
   - continue home OxyContin
   - oxycodone for breakthrough
   - continue home Lidoderm patches
   - d/c home pain meds while intubated
   # Asthma:
   - continue home albuterol, atrovent, Advair, Singulair
   # Diabetes:
   - continue decreased dose of insulin and sliding scale
   # GERD - continue PPI
   # Depression / anxiety:
   - continue home Effexor
   - appreciate psych input
   # Osteopenia - continue home Vitamin D and Calcium carbonate
   # FEN - diabetic low-protein diet
   -- Repleated Mg and K last night with improvement of K to 2.9 and Mg to
   2.2, continue to repleat K+
   -- Nutrition c/s for TBs,
   -- will need an OG tube placed when INR revered.
   # Access - PIV  18g x2 and 20g x2
   # PPx - pneumoboots, no heparin [**1-7**] thrombocytopenia, home PPI, bowel
   regimen
   # Code - FULL CODE (confirmed in family meeting w/ pt [**9-15**])
   # Dispo - MICU for now

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1900**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would emphasize and add
   the following:  The patient has a compilation of severe medical
   problems compounding each other, including resp failure, liver failure,
   and severe prosthetic joint infection with E  Coli.  Right now I
   believe her resp failure is due to her diffuse pulmonary infiltrates
   which in turn are likely due to bloody edema from acute lung injury
   from her EColi infection and her thrombocytopenia and liver
   coagulopathy. I do not see the value of a bronch and BAL at this point,
   as I am sure we will find blood in the lower airways, and this doesn
   impact our treatment plan.  The goal will be to cover her with
   antibiotics broadly (for her hip and her lungs), give blood and
   coagulation products, and to keep I/O on the dry side.  Her prognosis
   is fairly grim, I fear, though for now she remains on the liver tx
   list.  We will speak with ortho about how to best sterilze her right
   hip, and the timing of any operative intervention.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing progressive hypoxia, which can be caused by various factors such as volume overload with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, hepatopulmonary syndrome, or TRALI. The elevated INR and low platelets also suggest a higher risk for bleeding.

2. Coagulopathy/DIC: The patient has an elevated INR and low fibrinogen levels, along with the presence of hemoptysis. This raises concerns for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting.

3. Hip infection: The patient has a growing resistant E. coli infection in the hip, which may require surgical intervention. The presence of coag-negative staph in the past indicates a potential source of infection.

4. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis from Hepatitis C is worsening, as indicated by the increasing MELD score of 15-20. This puts her at risk for further complications related to liver dysfunction.

5. Anemia: The patient's current Hct is 21, which is lower than the baseline range of 23-27. This could be due to blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells.

6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may have masked septic physiology due to high-dose steroids."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who underwent TIPS procedure and had an E. coli infection in her right hip. She was admitted to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia. On admission, she exhibited increased respiratory distress, use of accessory muscles, tachypnea, hemoptysis, and worsening pulmonary edema. She required intubation for airway protection. 

Since admission, the patient has received various treatments including diuretics for fluid overload, antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, and evaluation for coagulopathy/DIC. She has also been evaluated for hepatopulmonary syndrome and other potential causes of hypoxia. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hip infection with a growing resistant E. coli, anemia, adrenal insufficiency, hyponatremia, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and malnutrition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening pulmonary edema could indicate pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, or hepatopulmonary syndrome. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Coagulopathy/DIC: The patient's increasing INR, low platelets, and hemoptysis raise concerns for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Additional tests are required to confirm this diagnosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who underwent TIPS surgery and was recently found to have an E. coli infection in her right hip with hardware. She was transferred to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia. Her current condition includes respiratory distress, worsening pulmonary edema, and hemoptysis. She is intubated for airway protection. The patient has a MELD score of 15-20 and is on the transplant list. She also has a hip infection caused by a resistant strain of E. coli and coagulopathy/DIC with an INR of 3.0. Other comorbidities include anemia, adrenal insufficiency, hyponatremia, pain, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia can be attributed to various causes such as volume overload with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, hepatopulmonary syndrome, TRALI, or PE. Further investigations are needed to identify the exact cause.

2. Hip infection: The patient has a growing resistant E. coli infection in her right hip. This infection needs to be managed appropriately with antibiotics like vancomycin and zosyn. Orthopedic input is required, and the patient may need to undergo surgery in the future.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of epistaxis. The patient received a transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 3 units of platelets. The patient also underwent anterior nasal packing due to the persistent epistaxis.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors. The patient's potassium levels were low, so potassium repletion was administered. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The patient's liver function tests show elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with extensive bilateral diffuse airspace consolidation and ground glass opacities seen on the chest CT. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. The patient's respiratory system compliance is decreased.

The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, but the patient's urine output has been low. The patient's serum potassium and magnesium levels are low, and the patient's calcium level is on the lower end of the normal range.

The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, but the platelet count is low. The patient's prothrombin time (PT), partial"

   Assessment and Plan
   49yo woman with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS (MELD 15), recently found to
   have E coli in right hip (with hardware), transferred to the MICU in
   the setting of progressive hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia:
   DDx include volume overload with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar
   hemorrhage (especially given elevated INR and low platelets).  There is
   some evidence to support hepatopulmonary syndrome (hyperdynamic Echo
   with pulm HTN).  Also consider TRALI, although she has received
   platelets after CXR showing alveolar infiltrates.  CT chest negative
   for PE ([**9-12**]).
   - albumin and lasix for diuresis (goal -1.5 L/day)
   - obtain repeat CT chest to further characterize findings on CXR
   - consider bronchoscopy in AM to eval for bleed
   - evaluate for coagulopathy/DIC as discussed below
   - consider TTE with bubble study if above work-up not revealing
   - check ABG in AM
   - sputum Cx; cover possible PNA with vanc/zosyn and Levo for double
   pseudomonas coverage
   - consider arterial line placement after FFP this pm
   # Hip infection:
   Growing resistant E coli; known to have coag negative staph in the
   past.
   - vanc/zosyn
   - appreciate ID and orthopedics input
   - plan per ortho had been to go to OR on Tuesday; will aim to optimize
   respiratory status prior to procedure
   - follow daily BCx
   - f/u read of MRI T/L-spine (unclear why ordered)
   # Coagulopathy:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to worsening liver failure, but INR has been
   increasing above baseline (2.0->2.9).  With dropping platelets and some
   hemoptysis, have concern for DIC.
   - check fibrinogen, FDP, smear
   - type and screen
   - continue vitamin K
   - check D-bilirubin
   # Cirrhosis from Hep C:
   MELD score this stay has been 15-20.  On transplant list.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - trend LFTs
   - appreciate liver recs
   # Anemia:  Current Hct 21, baseline Hct 23-27
   - type and screen
   - hold off on transfusion given respiratory status unless Hct continues
   to drop
   - follow Q8H Hct for now
   # Adrenal insufficiency:
   Consider possibility that septic physiology may be masked by high dose
   steroids.
   - wean steroids to hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q8H for now and Q12 tomorrow.
   - monitor blood sugars for hypoglycemia
   # Hyponatremia:  Na 131 (at baseline)
   - monitor Na with diuresis and [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   #. Pain:
   - continue home OxyContin
   - oxycodone for breakthrough
   - continue home Lidoderm patches
   - d/c home pain meds while intubated
   # Asthma:
   - continue home albuterol, atrovent, Advair, Singulair
   # Diabetes:
   - continue decreased dose of insulin and sliding scale
   # GERD - continue PPI
   # Depression / anxiety:
   - continue home Effexor
   - appreciate psych input
   # Osteopenia - continue home Vitamin D and Calcium carbonate
   # FEN - diabetic low-protein diet
   -- Repleated Mg and K last night with improvement of K to 2.9 and Mg to
   2.2, continue to repleat K+
   -- Nutrition c/s for TBs,
   -- will need an OG tube placed when INR revered.
   # Access - PIV  18g x2 and 20g x2
   # PPx - pneumoboots, no heparin [**1-7**] thrombocytopenia, home PPI, bowel
   regimen
   # Code - FULL CODE (confirmed in family meeting w/ pt [**9-15**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who has undergone TIPS placement. She was recently found to have E. coli in her right hip, with hardware, and was transferred to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes hip infection, coagulopathy, cirrhosis from Hep C, anemia, adrenal insufficiency, hyponatremia, pain, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and a low-protein diet for FEN. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia could be due to several possible causes, including volume overload with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, hepatopulmonary syndrome, TRALI, or PE. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Hip Infection: The patient has a growing resistant E. coli infection in her right hip, which is known to have coag-negative staph in the past. Appropriate antibiotics have been initiated, and input from ID and orthopedics is appreciated.

3. Coagulopathy/DIC: The patient's INR has been increasing above baseline, along with a drop in platelets and some hemoptysis. This raises concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Further investigation"

   Assessment and Plan
   49yo woman with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS (MELD 15), recently found to
   have E coli in right hip (with hardware), transferred to the MICU in
   the setting of progressive hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia:
   DDx include volume overload with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar
   hemorrhage (especially given elevated INR and low platelets).  Also
   consider [**Doctor Last Name 11**] in setting of infxn, TRALI, although she has received
   platelets after CXR showing alveolar infiltrates.  CT chest negative
   for PE ([**9-12**]). Since concerned for pulmonary edema and 2 liters
   positive will DC albumin [**Hospital1 7**] and try to keep negative 1 liter.
   Difficult to characterize if infectious process on CXR and CT with
   diffuse infiltrates. Afebrile but on steroids.
   - Try to keep negative 1 liter. Will give Lasix 80IV x 1and DC albumin
   - F/U final read chest CT
   - evaluate for coagulopathy/DIC as discussed below with [**Hospital1 7**] DIC labs
   - Follow ABGs
   - sputum Cx; cover possible PNA with vanc/meropenem and Levo for double
   pseudomonas coverage. If negative, will consider DC Vanco
   - consider arterial line placement
   - Will keep I
s limited to FFP only if procedures needed (ex. A line)
   # Hip infection:
   Growing resistant E coli; known to have coag negative staph in the
   past.
   - vanc/zosyn for [**Male First Name (un) 1640**]
   - appreciate ID and orthopedics input
   - plan per ortho, no longer planned for OR, but likely needs washout
   for infxn. Will d/w ortho . Need definitive plan for management of
   infxn.
   - follow daily BCx
   - No read or imaging seen for MRI TL spine
   # Coagulopathy:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to worsening liver failure, but INR has been
   increasing above baseline (2.0->2.9).  With dropping platelets and some
   hemoptysis, have concern for DIC.
   - check fibrinogen, FDP, smear, fibrinogen has remained stable, FDP
   most recently low
   - type and screen
   - Give FFP only as needed for procedures
   #Epistaxis: had anterior packing placed by ENT yesterday with
   hemostasis. No further bleeds. If bleeds again would use Afrin. Will
   need packing x 5 days with anti-staph coverage while packing in place.
   -          Packing x 5 days
   -          Afrin prn bleed
   -          Staph coverage Abx x 5 days
   -          Keep plt >[**Numeric Identifier 649**]
   # Cirrhosis from Hep C:
   MELD score this stay has been 15-20.  On transplant list.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - trend LFTs
   - appreciate liver recs
   # Anemia:  Transfused 5 units yesterday. No further bleeding. Would
   follow HCT q6-8 and tx <20.
   - follow Q8H Hct for now
   # Adrenal insufficiency:
   Consider possibility that septic physiology may be masked by high dose
   steroids. Currently stress situation given infection, diffuse pulmonary
   process, so do not want to decrease steroids too rapidly. Will decrease
   today to q12 hour and readdress tomorrow. If drops BP or goes for
   surgery or procedure may need to increase to q8 intervals.
   - wean steroids to hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q12H for now
   - monitor blood sugars for hyperglycemia on steroids
   # Hyponatremia:  Na today 135 s/p diuresis. Baseline around 131
   - monitor Na with diuresis and TID lytes
   #. Pain:  Off home pain meds on Fentanyl/Versed
   - continue home Lidoderm patches
   # Asthma:  Currently with wheezing on exam. On steroids as well as home
   meds.
   - continue home albuterol, atrovent, Advair, Singulair
   # Diabetes:
   - continue decreased dose of insulin and sliding scale, follow FSBS
   while on steroids
   # GERD - continue PPI
   # Depression / anxiety:
   - continue home Effexor
   - appreciate psych input
   # Osteopenia - continue home Vitamin D and Calcium carbonate
   # FEN - NPO currently since no access. NGT resulted in bleed. Will
   place OGT today so can receive TF, CS nutrition for TF recs and
   continue aggressive electrolyte repletion and monitoring, especially
   while on lasix
   -- Repleted Mg and K last night with some improvement
   -- Nutrition c/s for TFs,
   -- will need an OG tube placed.
   # Access - PIV  x 5.  Will place PICC request today
   # PPx - pneumoboots, no heparin [**1-7**] thrombocytopenia, home PPI, bowel
   regimen
   # Code - FULL CODE (confirmed in family meeting w/ pt [**9-15**])
   # Dispo - MICU for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who has been admitted to the ICU for progressive hypoxia. She has undergone several interventions, including transfusion of blood products, antibiotics, and diuretics. The patient's current condition includes diffuse bilateral airspace disease and pleural effusions. There are concerns about potential complications such as volume overload, pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient also has a hip infection with resistant E. coli, for which she is receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia could be due to various causes, including volume overload with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, or even transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI).
2. Infection: The patient has a hip infection with resistant E. coli and is receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage. There is a concern for possible secondary infections.
3. Coagulopathy/DIC: The patient's increasing INR and low platelets, along with hemoptysis, raise concerns for DIC. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has HCV-related cirrhosis, and her MELD score is between 15-20, indicating significant liver dysfunction. She is on the transplant list.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   49yo woman with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS (MELD 15), recently found to
   have E coli in right hip (with hardware), transferred to the MICU in
   the setting of progressive hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia:
   DDx include volume overload with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar
   hemorrhage (especially given elevated INR and low platelets).  Also
   consider [**Doctor Last Name 11**] in setting of infxn, TRALI, although she has received
   platelets after CXR showing alveolar infiltrates.  CT chest negative
   for PE ([**9-12**]). Since concerned for pulmonary edema and 2 liters
   positive will DC albumin [**Hospital1 7**] and try to keep negative 1 liter.
   Difficult to characterize if infectious process on CXR and CT with
   diffuse infiltrates. Afebrile but on steroids.
   - Try to keep negative 1 liter. Will give Lasix 80IV x 1and DC albumin
   - F/U final read chest CT
   - evaluate for coagulopathy/DIC as discussed below with [**Hospital1 7**] DIC labs
   - Follow ABGs
   - sputum Cx; cover possible PNA with vanc/meropenem and Levo for double
   pseudomonas coverage. If negative, will consider DC Vanco
   - consider arterial line placement
   - Will keep I
s limited to FFP only if procedures needed (ex. A line)
   # Hip infection:
   Growing resistant E coli; known to have coag negative staph in the
   past.
   - vanc/zosyn for [**Male First Name (un) 1640**]
   - appreciate ID and orthopedics input
   - plan per ortho, no longer planned for OR, but likely needs washout
   for infxn. Will d/w ortho . Need definitive plan for management of
   infxn.
   - follow daily BCx
   - No read or imaging seen for MRI TL spine
   # Coagulopathy:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to worsening liver failure, but INR has been
   increasing above baseline (2.0->2.9).  With dropping platelets and some
   hemoptysis, have concern for DIC.
   - check fibrinogen, FDP, smear, fibrinogen has remained stable, FDP
   most recently low
   - type and screen
   - Give FFP only as needed for procedures
   #Epistaxis: had anterior packing placed by ENT yesterday with
   hemostasis. No further bleeds. If bleeds again would use Afrin. Will
   need packing x 5 days with anti-staph coverage while packing in place.
   -          Packing x 5 days
   -          Afrin prn bleed
   -          Staph coverage Abx x 5 days

   # Cirrhosis from Hep C:
   MELD score this stay has been 15-20.  On transplant list.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - trend LFTs
   - appreciate liver recs
   # Anemia:  Transfused 5 units yesterday. No further bleeding. Would
   follow HCT q6-8 and tx <20.
   - follow Q8H Hct for now
   # Adrenal insufficiency:
   Consider possibility that septic physiology may be masked by high dose
   steroids. Currently stress situation given infection, diffuse pulmonary
   process, so do not want to decrease steroids too rapidly. Will decrease
   today to q12 hour and readdress tomorrow. If drops BP or goes for
   surgery or procedure may need to increase to q8 intervals.
   - wean steroids to hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q12H for now
   - monitor blood sugars for hyperglycemia on steroids
   # Hyponatremia:  Na today 135 s/p diuresis. Baseline around 131
   - monitor Na with diuresis and TID lytes
   #. Pain:  Off home pain meds on Fentanyl/Versed
   - continue home Lidoderm patches
   # Asthma:  Currently with wheezing on exam. On steroids as well as home
   meds.
   - continue home albuterol, atrovent, Advair, Singulair
   # Diabetes:
   - continue decreased dose of insulin and sliding scale, follow FSBS
   while on steroids

   # Depression / anxiety:
   - continue home Effexor
   - appreciate psych input
   # Osteopenia - continue home Vitamin D and Calcium carbonate
   # FEN - NPO currently since no access. NGT resulted in bleed. Will
   place OGT today so can receive TF, CS nutrition for TF recs and
   continue aggressive electrolyte repletion and monitoring, especially
   while on lasix
   -- Repleted Mg and K last night with some improvement
   -- Nutrition c/s for TFs,
   -- will need an OG tube placed.
   # Access - PIV  x 5.  Will place PICC request today

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2391**]
s note and I agree
   with the findings and plan of care.  I would add that from a
   respiratory status we have not gained any ground, with largely
   unchanged vent settings and diffuse infiltrates on CXR.  I/O was
   positive yesterday, in large part due to her blood products needed for
   her large nasal bleed.  She also  almost certainly aspirated a good
   amount of that blood from the upper resp tract.  Today the goal will be
   to diurese her, and to do that we will need to decrease our crystalloid
   and colloid infusions and continue lasix.  We will continue her
   antibiotics which cover her E Coli in her hip and also empirically
   cover for a lower resp infection.  However she will need more
   definitive orthopedic intervention on her hip and we
ll consult with
   ortho on the timing of this.  We will also evaluate her for a PICC so
   that KCl can be given more easily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who was admitted to the MICU for progressive hypoxia. She has a MELD score of 15-20 and is on the transplant list. The patient's conditions include hip infection with resistant E. coli, diffuse bilateral airspace consolidation on chest CT, and coagulopathy with an increasing INR and low platelets. She also has epistaxis that required anterior nasal packing, anemia, hyponatremia, adrenal insufficiency, and several other medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern due to diffuse infiltrates on CXR and CT chest. There is a possibility of pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, or pulmonary edema. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABGs is necessary.

2. Coagulopathy/DIC: The patient's INR has been increasing, and she has low platelets along with hemoptysis. This raises concerns for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Monitoring fibrinogen levels, FDP, smear, and considering FFP for procedures are important.

3. Hip Infection: The patient has a growing resistant E. coli in her hip joint. Close monitoring of daily BCx and appropriate antibiotic coverage are crucial.

4. Epistaxis: The patient had anterior nasal packing for epistaxis, which should be removed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis and recent TIPS procedure, presenting with hypoxia and a confirmed E. coli infection in her right hip with hardware. She was transferred to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, hip infection, coagulopathy, epistaxis, cirrhosis from Hep C, anemia, adrenal insufficiency, hyponatremia, pain, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and inability to receive oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to volume overload with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, or possibly an infectious process. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Hip infection: The patient has a growing resistant E. coli infection in her right hip. It is essential to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and consider washout for infection management.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR has been increasing above baseline, which may indicate worsening liver failure. With dropping platelets and some hemoptysis, there is concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Monitoring fibrinogen, FDP levels, and providing FFP as needed for procedures is recommended.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who underwent TIPS placement. She was admitted to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need attention.

1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation remains stable, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. The goal is to continue weaning while monitoring her acid-base status.

2. Fluid Status: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating possible volume overload. Diuretics should be continued to manage this issue.

3. Melena: The patient experienced two episodes of melena overnight, and she received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets. Serial monitoring of hematocrit (Hct) levels is recommended.

4. Acid-Base Status: The patient's ABG shows evidence of metabolic and respiratory alkalosis. The respiratory alkalosis may be due to increased minute ventilation, which could be caused by pain, tidal volume settings, or aspiration. Vent settings will be adjusted to decrease ventilation, sedation will be controlled, and a bronchoscopy may be considered to assess for bronchial aspirations.

5. Hepatic encephalopathy (HAP): Although the patient remains afebrile and without leukocytosis, her worsening chest X-ray raises concerns for"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2207**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.
   Regarding the patient
s resp failure her gas exchange and CXR have not
   improved and her lungs have more rhonchi.  Bronch and BAL were done and
   airways have scant rusty mucus but no plugging with clots or mucus.
   BAL of RML was sanguinous and was sent for C&S. We will attempt to
   switch to PSV to allow lower Ve and less alkalosis, but this is always
   difficult in cirrhotics with an increased drive to breathe.
   We will start Diamox in order to attenuate met alkalosis and allow
   diuresis, once her K levels are stabilized.  Hopefully with continued
   control of her coagulopathy and some diuresis, and control of her
   infection there will be no further lung injury or capillary
   leak/bleeding and her CXR and gas exchange will improve
   Appreciate ortho, ID, and hepatology input.  We will hold off on OG
   tube for now, as per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**], but soon we will have to address
   nutrition, enterally or per PICC.
   Despite her melena (which I believe is not from GI bleed but from
   swallowed blood from her ENT bleed 36 hrs ago), and despite no
   lactulose, she is awake enough to nod her head to my questions today!

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who has undergone TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) and is currently in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit). The patient's chief complaint is acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and she has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include the placement of a PICC line yesterday, failure to achieve a target diuresis goal due to the patient being hyperkalemic on ABG (Arterial Blood Gas), two episodes of melena/maroon-colored stool overnight, and the administration of 2 units of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. The patient has also received Vitamin K, and consultations have been obtained from Infectious Disease, Orthopedics, Hepatology, and Psychiatry.

The patient's allergies include shellfish, rash from Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine HCl), hepatic toxicity, and tricyclic compounds. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem.

Currently, the patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam (Versed), as well as other ICU medications such as furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and several other medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, and an MELD score of 15-20. She is currently in the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She also has an ESBL E. coli infection in her right hip. Her laboratory results show signs of metabolic and respiratory alkalosis, as well as an elevated INR and low platelets. The patient is on multiple medications including diuretics, sedatives, antibiotics, and other supportive care medications. She is also being treated for various comorbidities such as diabetes, asthma, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: Given her infection with ESBL E. coli and the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, she is at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's recent use of lasix and the presence of fluid overload may contribute to the development of AKI.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Her liver disease and elevated bilirubin levels may predispose her to hepatic encephalopathy.

   # Acid- Base Status:
   ABG this AM with evidence of metabolic and respiratory alkalosis.
   Respiratory Alkalosis as evident by increased minute ventilation 9-10.
   Etiologies include pain induced from under sedation, tidal volume vent
   settings, or secondary to patients aspiration.
   -          Wil adjust vent settings to decrease Ve.
   -          Control patients sedation
   -          Considering bronch to assess for bronchial aspirations
   secondary to recent epistaxis and high pitched lung sounds on exam
   and/or hemorrhage given prior elevated INR and low platelets.
   In regards to pt

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The ABG results show respiratory alkalosis, indicating a possible issue with oxygenation. It is crucial to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels and adjust the ventilator settings accordingly.

2. Fluid Status: The patient has shown signs of fluid overload, as indicated by worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray and increased weight gain. It is important to closely monitor the patient's fluid balance and continue diuresis to manage this issue.

3. Melena: The patient has experienced two episodes of melena, which may be indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding. Serial monitoring of Hcts (hematocrit) levels is necessary, and liver function should be closely followed.

4. Acid-Base Status: The patient has metabolic and respiratory alkalosis. Adjusting vent settings to decrease minute ventilation, controlling sedation, and considering bronchoscopy to assess for aspiration are all necessary steps to address this issue.

5. Hip Infection: The patient has an ESBL E. coli infection in the right hip. It is important to continue with the appropriate antibiotic regimen as per ID recommendations and plan for an MRI to evaluate the extent of the infection.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a bleeding tendency. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters, particularly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who underwent TIPS placement in the past (MELD score of 15), and is currently admitted to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia. She has an esbl E. coli infection in her right hip and was transferred from the floor to the ICU. 

The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to a mixed etiology including infection and ARDS. Her oxygen saturation has been stable at 50% on ventilatory support with pressure support of 5, PEEP of 5, and FiO2 of 50%. However, she experienced respiratory distress this morning, which was dysynchronous with the ventilator. 

Her fluid status is positive by 1 liter per day, despite diuresis with lasix, and her CXR shows worsening bilateral opacities, suggesting volume overload. 

She also has melena, but it is unlikely to be of gastrointestinal origin given her history of epistaxis and stable hematocrit. She received 2 units of PRBC early morning on [**9-18**] with stable hematocrit for 24 hours. 

There is a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia, as she remains afebrile without leukocytosis, although her CXR worsens.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including orthopedic and hepatic issues. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several complications.

From the note, it appears that the patient attempted to diurese but continued to be alkalotic and did not want to exacerbate compensatory alkalosis. The patient's breathing was above the set rate on the ventilator, leading to an episode of increased work of breathing. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results showed a pH of 7.43, which is within the normal range, but the patient's lactate level was elevated at 2.9.

The patient also has an infected right hemiarthroplasty, for which they were taken to the operating room for implant removal and placement of an antibiotic spacer. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells and 4 units of platelets prior to anesthesia.

Additionally, the patient has been experiencing hyperkalemia, and efforts have been made to treat it with Lasix. The patient's Vancomycin trough level was low, so the dosage was increased to every 12 hours instead of every 24 hours.

A bronchoscopy was performed, revealing tan-colored thin mucus in the endotracheal tube and large, rusty-colored airways. No active bleeding or clots were observed in the airways, but a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, progressive.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- radiographic progression over past 24 hrs.
   Underlying etiology uncertain.  BAL results pending from yesterday.
   Concerns include ARDS, alveolar hemorrhage, pneumonia.  Also active
   bronchospasm --> need to optimize medications, including iv steroids.
   Need to optimize sedation.
   ASTHMA -- poorly controlled currently.  Need to optimize medications.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic anaemia.  Monitor serial Hct.
   MELENA -- attributed to epistaxis.  Monitor s/p nasal packing.  Monitor
   stools.
   INR-- elevated, attributed to cirrhosis.  Currently stable since

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated. The underlying etiology of the respiratory failure is uncertain, with concerns including ARDS, alveolar hemorrhage, and pneumonia. The patient also has asthma that is poorly controlled and requires optimization of medications. Additionally, the patient has anemia, possibly due to hemorrhagic blood loss from epistaxis. Melena is being monitored as well. The patient's INR is elevated, likely due to cirrhosis, but it is currently stable. There is a history of NIDDM, and blood glucose levels should be monitored and maintained below 150. The patient has a right hip sepsis caused by an ESBL E.coli infection, awaiting orthopedic intervention. The patient experienced epistaxis, which has been treated with nasal packing. The patient is a candidate for liver transplantation but no plans are currently in place. Fluid management aims for a net diuresis of 1000 mL/24 hours. Nutritional support will be initiated through total parenteral nutrition (TF). The patient is receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of shellfish allergy, rash from Flexeril, and hepatic toxicity from tricyclic compounds. The patient was admitted to the ICU for severe complications related to a surgical procedure. The patient underwent hardware removal and placement of a cement antibiotic spacer with VAC. An arterial line was started on 09/19/2018 at 03:15 PM. The patient also had a RIJ TLC placed on 09/20/2018 at 01:06 AM and started on insulin gtt for improved glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. Some of these complications include:

1. Infection: The patient had hardware removal and placement of a cement antibiotic spacer with VAC, indicating a risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, should be done.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode. This indicates that the patient may have significant respiratory compromise. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status, including oxygenation and ventilation parameters, is crucial.

3. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance is monitored closely, with a total fluid intake of 6,514 mL and output of 2,990 mL. Close monitoring of fluid status is necessary to prevent fluid overload or dehydration"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who underwent total hip replacement surgery. She was transferred to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has a complicated medical history including ESBL E. coli of the right hip, suspected infection, possible pulmonary edema, and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's fluid and acid-base status improved after aggressive diuresis with lasix, and she received two units of packed red blood cells for anemia. Her coagulopathy is being managed with fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions. She has a history of hepatic cirrhosis with a MELD score of 15-20 and is currently deactivated from the transplant list. The patient also has adrenal insufficiency, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and is on multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has an active infection caused by ESBL E. coli and is on appropriate antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin). Close monitoring of wound drainage and follow-up cultures are necessary to prevent or manage any potential infections.

2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The etiology of the patient's acute respiratory failure is unclear and likely multifactorial. It is important to continue monitoring oxygen saturation, adjust ventilator settings if needed, and consider"

   Assessment and Plan
   49yo woman with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS [**2153**] (MELD 15), with ESBL E.
   Coli of R hip, transferred to the MICU in the setting of progressive
   hypoxia.
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear and likely
   mixed picture. Differential includes infection, ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**] given diffuse
   BL infiltrates, pulmonary edema. 02 saturation stable overnight.
   Minimal vent settings with pressure support 5, PEEP 5. Fi02 stable at
   50%. However, upon later exam this am pt with respiratory distress,
   dysynchronous from vent
   -          Continue current vent settings
   -          Increase sedation to improve comfort, decrease dysynchrony
   -          Obtain arterial line to follow ABGs
   -          Continue diuresis with lasix gtt to try to keep negative 1
   liter since has been positive 1 liter per day. Diuresis now enabled by
   improved alkalosis, on diamox
   -          F/U BAL results to determine if pneumonia present
   # Fluid/Acid base Status: In regards to volume status, pt has been
   roughly 1 liter positive each day, 1 liter pos yesterday despite lasix
   40 IV x2. Diuresis was limited by acid-base status. Peripheral edema
   improved but CXR continues to look volume overloaded vs. ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]. CXR
   confirms worsening bilateral opacities that may be indicative of
   worsening volume overload.
   -          Will start lasix gtt with goal negative 1 liter
   -          Continue Diamox for alkalosis to enable diuresis
   -
   # Melena: Likely [**1-7**] epistaxis. GI consulted and did not think bleed
   was necessarily GI given prior h/o epistaxis and stable HCT. She was
   transfused 2 units PRBC early am on [**9-18**] with Hct Stable x 24 hours.
   -          Serial monitoring of Hcts
   -          Liver Following
   -          Ruling out C diff, will send repeat sample
   # HAP?: Pt remains afbrile without leukocytosis although worsening CXR.
   Little reserve to treat empirically for infection although no focal
   consolidation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis and ESBL E. coli of R hip, admitted to the MICU for progressive hypoxia. She has acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with an unclear etiology, possibly mixed including infection and ARDS. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. There are bilateral opacities on chest X-ray, which may indicate volume overload or ARDS. She has been positive 1 liter per day in fluid balance and diuresis has been limited by acid-base status. Her MELD score is 15-20 and she is on the transplant list.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dysynchrony with the ventilator suggest worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Fluid/Acid-base Status: The patient's fluid overload and positive fluid balance need to be addressed to prevent further complications such as pulmonary edema or ARDS.
3. Melena: Although the GI consultation does not consider it a GI bleed, serial monitoring of Hcts is required to rule out ongoing blood loss.
4. HAP: Despite the absence of fever and leukocytosis, the worsening CXR and lack of focal consolidation raise concerns for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Continuing Vanc/Meropenem empirically is appropriate.
5. Hip Infection/Pain"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Unclear etiology, but may be
   multifactorial (asthma, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates).  Concern for
   pulmonary edema component.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.
   Optimize asthma management, allow net diuresis.  F/U CXR.  Monitor ABG.
   EPISTAXIS -- stable.  Continue nasal packing.  Monitor serial Hct.
   Empirical antibiotics.  ENT to f/u.
   ASTHMA -- optimize management.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- desire to initiate TF.  WOuld initiate TPN if
   not able to start TF.
   HYPKALEMIA -- total body depleted.  Replete to K>4.0.  Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- blood loss.  Transfuse to Hct >25
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative 1-1.5 L/24 hours with Lasix drip.
   MELANA -- suspect epistaxis, now clearing.  Monitor.
   ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY -- continues with steroid supplimentation.
   DIABETES MELLITUS -- insulin drip to maintain glucose <150.
   Right HIP INFECTION -- s/p removal of right hip hardware.  Continue
   antimicrobials for ESBL e. coli.  Further interventions per Ortho
   service.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, likely caused by a combination of factors including asthma, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and possible pulmonary edema. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear, but there are concerns for asthma exacerbation and pulmonary edema. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, optimize asthma management, allow net diuresis, and monitor arterial blood gases (ABG).

Other notable conditions include epistaxis, anemia due to blood loss, hypokalemia, and diabetes mellitus. The patient has a history of allergies to shellfish, Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine HCl), and hepatic toxicity. The patient underwent a surgical procedure on the right hip and had a right hip infection caused by ESBL e. coli, for which appropriate antimicrobial therapy is being administered.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including insulin, fentanyl, midazolam, and lasix. Nutritional support is planned through tube feeds or total parenteral nutrition if TF cannot be initiated. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and blood products have been transfused to address anemia. Fluid balance is being managed with a goal of net negative 1-1.5 L/24 hours. Adrenal insufficiency is being treated with steroid supplementation.

The patient is at risk for complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis ("

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Unclear etiology, but may be
   multifactorial (asthma, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates).  Concern for
   pulmonary edema component.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.
   Optimize asthma management, allow net diuresis.  F/U CXR.  Monitor ABG.
   EPISTAXIS -- stable.  Continue nasal packing.  Monitor serial Hct.
   Empirical antibiotics.  ENT to f/u.
   ASTHMA -- optimize management.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- desire to initiate TF.  WOuld initiate TPN if
   not able to start TF.
   HYPKALEMIA -- total body depleted.  Replete to K>4.0.  Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- blood loss.  Transfuse to Hct >25
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative 1-1.5 L/24 hours with Lasix drip.
   MELANA -- suspect epistaxis, now clearing.  Monitor.
   ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY -- continues with steroid supplimentation.
   DIABETES MELLITUS -- insulin drip to maintain glucose <150.
   Right HIP INFECTION -- s/p removal of right hip hardware.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Further interventions per Ortho service.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient underwent a surgical procedure on the right hip and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure persists, with unclear etiology but possibly multifactorial (asthma, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates). There is concern for a pulmonary edema component. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, optimize asthma management, allow net diuresis, and monitor ABG and CXR.

2. Epistaxis: The patient experienced epistaxis, which is stable. Nasal packing will continue, and serial Hct will be monitored. Empirical antibiotics have been initiated, and ENT will follow up.

3. Asthma: Asthma management will be optimized.

4. Nutritional Support: The desire is to initiate tube feeding (TF) and would initiate total parenteral nutrition (TPN) if TF is not able to start.

5. Hypokalemia: The patient has total body depleted potassium, and repletion to K>4.0 will be monitored.

6. Anemia: Anemia is due to blood loss, and transfusion to Hct >25 will be done.

7. Fluids: Net negative 1-1.5 L/24 hours with Lasix drip is desired.

8. Melena: Melena is suspected due to epist"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis and previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to progressive hypoxia and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent an organ transplant yesterday and tolerated the procedure well. She has multiple comorbidities, including asthma, diabetes, depression/anxiety, GERD, osteopenia, and hypercoagulability. The patient's current condition is acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, with an unclear etiology but likely multifactorial including infection, pulmonary edema, and possibly [Doctor Last Name 11]. The patient's fluid and acid-base status has improved, allowing for diuresis with Lasix to be continued at a goal of -1 to -1.5 liters per day. The patient's anemia has stabilized, and she received two packed red blood cells (pRBCs) this morning. Her coagulopathy is being managed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelet transfusions as needed. The patient's Hepatitis C cirrhosis with a MELD score of 15-20 has led to deactivation from the transplant list. She is also being treated for adrenal insufficiency, asthma, diabetes, GERD, and osteopenia. The patient's OG"

   Coli of R hip, transferred to the MICU in the setting of progressive
   hypoxia now P.O.D. #2 for R ex-plant
   # S/P Ex-Plant: POD#2 Tolerated procedure. Hip drainage stable
   -          Closely being followed by Ortho
   -          F/U cultures from procedure, all no growth. Prior hip cx
   ESBL E coli [**Last Name (un) 270**] to [**Last Name (un) 614**]
   -          Continue Meropenem and Vanc Per I.D. Recs, will need to
   discuss course now she has had drainage and removal of hardware
   -          Will check vanc trough in am, dose accordingly
   -          Monitor drainage from wound, stable.
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Etiology remains unclear and
   likely multifactorial including infection, [**Doctor Last Name 11**],  and pulmonary edema.
   Infection less likely given no growth from BAL. 02 saturation stable
   overnight. No changes to vent settings overnight. Lung exam improved
   but CXR shows persistent bilateral infiltrates.
   -          Cont current vent settings, will check SBT and RSBI today
   although have been unable to decrease FiO2 and PaO2 only 90 on 50%.
   Will check repeat ABG, try to decrease FiO2. Will likely need
   resolution of underlying lung process which by CXR is persistent
   -          Continue diuresis with lasix gtt  with goal of -500 to -1L
   per / day, will follow hourly I/O
   -          Cont Meropenem / Vanc
   -          F/U BAL finalized cultures
   # Fluid/Acid base Status: Pt positive during LOS. Are attempting to
   diurese to improve pulmonary edema. Lung exam improved this am after
   diuresis 1liter but CXR unchanged. Diuresis limited by acid-base status
   and alkalosis although may need to equilibrate. CVP elevated and has
   been positive so likely not dry. Alkalosis may be from diuresis even
   though not necessarily total body volume depleted. CXR continues to
   look volume overloaded vs. [**Doctor Last Name 11**].  Alkalosis worsened but off diamox.
   Will need to recheck bicarb in pm
   -          Lasix gtt with goal negative -.5-1L giving time to
   equilibrate while diuresing
   -          Aggressive electrolyte repletion with K sliding scale

   # Anemia: No subsequent events of Melena or epistaxis, HCT this AM
   24.6, stable. Was 26.8.
   -          PM Hct and serial [**Hospital1 7**] monitoring of Hcts.
   -          Liver Following
   -          Hct goal of 25 although unclear if neccessary given h/o CAD.
   Will recheck in pm
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.0 today, stable, has not required FFP since
   periop. Likely [**1-7**] liver disease +/- nutritional deficiency given no
   nutrition since transfer until yesterday. No further epistaxis.
   Platelets continue to be low. Was transfused this am, repeat plt 51.
   Will recheck since need to keep >50 and will have packing removed today
   by ENT.
   - Type and Screen
   - FFP as needed for procedures
   # Hep C cirrhosis: MELD score this stay has been 15-20.  Now
   deactivated from transplant list.
   - Restarted lactulose for bowel regimen now has OGT, no stool in approx
   2 days
   - trend LFTs
   - F/U liver recs
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Received stress dose steroids q8 periop for
   procedure.
   - Hydrocortisone 50mg IV now Q12H.
   - Change Insulin drip to Sliding scale once off stress dose steroids
   # Asthma: Wheezing, bronchospasm much improved with diuresis and
   albuterol/ipratropium.
   -          continue albuterol, atrovent nebs
   # Diabetes:  Continue Insulin Drip for now on hydrocortisone and would
   like good glycemic control for infection .
   - will consider change to ISS tomorrow
   # GERD - continue PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who underwent a total hip replacement surgery. She was transferred to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has been diagnosed with ESBL E. coli of the right hip, which was treated with meropenem and vancomycin. Her current condition is acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, with etiology still unclear. She also has fluid/acid-base status, anemia, coagulopathy, hepatic dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, and osteopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli infection and is currently on meropenem and vancomycin. There is a possibility of developing antibiotic resistance or recurrence of infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, which could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Fluid/Acid-Base Imbalance: The patient is positive for fluid balance during her hospital stay, and diuresis has been initiated to improve pulmonary edema. However, there is a risk of developing electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, but there is a possibility of worsening anemia due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis who underwent a total hip replacement surgery and was admitted to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli infection in her right hip, and her MELD score is 15-20. She has been de-activated from the transplant list.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The etiology of the respiratory failure remains unclear and is likely multifactorial, including infection, underlying liver disease, and pulmonary edema.
2. Fluid/Acid-Base Status: The patient has had a significant fluid overload during her LOS, and diuresis was initially limited by acid-base status. However, her acid-base status has improved, and aggressive electrolyte repletion is being continued.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has been decreasing, indicating anemia. Two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) were transfused this morning. Close monitoring of Hct levels is recommended.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 1.9, indicating coagulopathy. Platelet levels are stable after a platelet transfusion in the operating room. Fibrinogen levels have remained stable, and further monitoring of FDP and smear is advised.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-inch individual in the ICU with ongoing medical interventions. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, insulin, fentanyl, midazolam, and lasix infusions. They have a history of allergies to shellfish, rash from Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine Hcl), hepatic toxicity, and unknown allergies to tricyclic compounds. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned below.

24-hour events include meeting the input/output goal, repleting potassium and magnesium, administering D5W for hypernatremia, and transfusing platelets due to a count of less than 50 (31). The patient is on a Lasix drip and has received various medications.

Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate between 57-78 bpm, blood pressure within normal ranges, respiratory rate between 12-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's rhythm is sinus, and their central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,712 mL and a total output of 4,955 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,243 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) assist, and auto flow. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, and HCO3- of 90 mEq/L. 

Laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, sodium of 124 mg/dL, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, chloride of 108 mEq/L, magnesium of 28 mg/dL, glucose of 177 mg/dL, and platelets of 117 K/uL. Other lab results are within normal ranges or slightly elevated. 

Assessment and plan include ongoing ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and lines in place for arterial and venous access. Prophylactic measures are being taken for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. An OG tube has been placed for initiation of tube feeds, and the patient has tolerated net diuresis. Sedatives are being tapered, and the patient's allergies include shellfish, Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine Hcl), and hepatic toxicity from tricyclic compounds. The patient has a history of asthma, pulmonary edema (ARDS vs. cardiogenic), alveolar hemorrhage, pneumonia, cirrhosis (hep C), encephalopathy (hepatic), coagulopathy (liver disease), epistaxis, right hip infection (ESBL E. coli) with removal of hardware, leg hematomas, and a nutritional support plan in place via NGT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates ongoing difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This can lead to further deterioration in their condition if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of infections, including a right hip infection caused by ESBL E. coli, which required removal of hardware. There is also mention of ongoing antibiotics for epistaxis and pneumonia. Infections can complicate the clinical course and contribute to organ dysfunction.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy attributed to liver disease. This increases the risk of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, cirrhosis due to hep C, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and a history of epistaxis. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated, with an endotracheal tube in place. The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line. They are receiving nutritional support through a nasogastric tube and have ongoing care for right hip infection and leg hematomas. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is persistent and multifactorial, with possible causes including bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and pneumonia. Monitoring and management of oxygenation, ventilation, and potential underlying causes are essential to prevent further deterioration.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis due to hep C, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome. Monitoring liver function, managing encephalopathy with lactulose, and considering transplant evaluation are important in the management of cirrhosis.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, which should be managed by reducing sedatives and resuming lactulose. Close monitoring of mental status and neurologic function is necessary to detect any"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who underwent a total hip replacement surgery. She was transferred to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with improved respiratory status overnight. She has a history of ESBL E. coli infection in the hip, which has been treated with meropenem and vancomycin. Her recent cultures have shown no growth. The patient's fluid and acid-base status are being closely monitored, and she is receiving aggressive electrolyte repletion. Her anemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic function are also being managed. The patient has a history of asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and is currently on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including infection, liver disease, and pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilator settings is necessary.

2. Infection: Although the patient's recent cultures have shown no growth, she has a history of ESBL E. coli infection in the hip. It is important to continue meropenem and vancomycin therapy as per ID recommendations and monitor for any signs of infection.

3. Fluid/Acid-base status: The patient's fluid and acid-base status are positive during her hospital stay. Diuresis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has undergone several interventions. The patient has a history of allergies to shellfish, rash from Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine Hcl), hepatic toxicity from Tricyclic Compounds, and an unknown allergy.

The patient received two units of platelets prior to the removal of nasal packing due to bleeding, which resolved. They were also given Afrin for epistaxis and advised to hold pressure and call the ENT if the bleeding does not stop.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/67 mmHg to 152/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on ventilatory support with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 49. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 14 cmH2O, plateau pressure is 17 cmH2O, and the patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 57 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 248, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 9.1 L/min.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8.8 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin (Hb) at 9.3 g/dL, normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) at 122 mg/dL, slightly decreased platelet count (Plt) at 52 K/uL, normal prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) at 21.7/35.4/2.1, respectively. The patient's kidney function is normal based on the creatinine (Cr) level of 0.6 mg/dL, and liver function tests (ALT/AST) are within normal limits at 24/42. The patient's electrolytes are also within normal ranges, except for a slightly low potassium (K+) level of 3.6 mEq/L.

The patient has multiple drains, including NG, stool, and other drains, with a total fluid balance of 580 mL positive. The patient's arterial line, PICC line, and multi-lumen line are all in place for ongoing management.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition with Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 40 mL/hour, glycemic control"

   49yo woman with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS [**2153**] (MELD 15), with ESBL E.
   Coli of R hip, transferred to the MICU in the setting of progressive
   hypoxia now P.O.D. #2 for R ex-plant
   # S/P Ex-Plant: POD#2 Tolerated procedure. Hip drainage stable
   -          Closely being followed by Ortho
   -          F/U cultures from procedure, all no growth. Prior hip cx
   ESBL E coli [**Last Name (un) 270**] to [**Last Name (un) 614**]
   -          Continue Meropenem and Vanc Per I.D. Recs, will need to
   discuss course now she has had drainage and removal of hardware
   -          Will check vanc trough in am, dose accordingly
   -          Monitor drainage from wound, stable.
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Etiology remains unclear and
   likely multifactorial including infection, [**Doctor Last Name 11**],  and pulmonary edema.
   Infection less likely given no growth from BAL. 02 saturation stable
   overnight. No changes to vent settings overnight. Lung exam improved
   but CXR shows persistent bilateral infiltrates.
   -          Cont current vent settings, will check SBT and RSBI today
   although have been unable to decrease FiO2 and PaO2 only 90 on 50%.
   Will check repeat ABG, try to decrease FiO2. Will likely need
   resolution of underlying lung process which by CXR is persistent
   -          Continue diuresis with lasix gtt  with goal of -500 to -1L
   per / day, will follow hourly I/O
   -          Cont Meropenem / Vanc
   -          F/U BAL finalized cultures
   # Fluid/Acid base Status: Pt positive during LOS. Are attempting to
   diurese to improve pulmonary edema. Lung exam improved this am after
   diuresis 1liter but CXR unchanged. Diuresis limited by acid-base status
   and alkalosis although may need to equilibrate. CVP elevated and has
   been positive so likely not dry. Alkalosis may be from diuresis even
   though not necessarily total body volume depleted. CXR continues to
   look volume overloaded vs. [**Doctor Last Name 11**].  Alkalosis worsened but off diamox.
   Will need to recheck bicarb in pm
   -          Lasix gtt with goal negative -.5-1L giving time to
   equilibrate while diuresing
   -          Aggressive electrolyte repletion with K sliding scale
   -          Recheck in pm
   # Anemia: No subsequent events of Melena or epistaxis, HCT this AM
   24.6, stable. Was 26.8.
   -          PM Hct and serial [**Hospital1 7**] monitoring of Hcts.
   -          Liver Following
   -          Hct goal of 25 although unclear if neccessary given h/o CAD.
   Will recheck in pm
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.0 today, stable, has not required FFP since
   periop. Likely [**1-7**] liver disease +/- nutritional deficiency given no
   nutrition since transfer until yesterday. No further epistaxis.
   Platelets continue to be low. Was transfused this am, repeat plt 51.
   Will recheck since need to keep >50 and will have packing removed today
   by ENT.
   - Type and Screen
   - FFP as needed for procedures
   # Hep C cirrhosis: MELD score this stay has been 15-20.  Now
   deactivated from transplant list.
   - Restarted lactulose for bowel regimen now has OGT, no stool in approx
   2 days
   - trend LFTs
   - F/U liver recs
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Received stress dose steroids q8 periop for
   procedure.
   - Hydrocortisone 50mg IV now Q12H.
   - Change Insulin drip to Sliding scale once off stress dose steroids
   # Asthma: Wheezing, bronchospasm much improved with diuresis and
   albuterol/ipratropium.
   -          continue albuterol, atrovent nebs
   # Diabetes:  Continue Insulin Drip for now on hydrocortisone and would
   like good glycemic control for infection .
   - will consider change to ISS tomorrow
   # GERD - continue PPI
   # Depression / Anxiety:
   - holding home PO meds
   # Osteopenia - Stable
    - continue home Vitamin D and Calcium carbonate

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis and recent TIPS procedure, who was admitted to the ICU due to progressive hypoxia. She has undergone an R ex-plant and is now POD#2. The patient's current condition includes acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, fluid/aacid-base status, anemia, coagulopathy, hep C cirrhosis, adrenal insufficiency, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and FEN. She has multiple medical complications and is being treated with various medications and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli infection in the hip and is currently on meropenem and vancomycin. There is a possibility of ongoing or new infections, which should be closely monitored.
2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including infection, liver disease, and pulmonary edema. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and diuretics to manage her condition.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has low platelet counts and an elevated INR, indicating a risk of bleeding. She will require close monitoring and may need FFP transfusion for procedures.
4. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: The patient has decompensated cirrhosis with a MELD score of 15-20. She is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and sepsis. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's condition has been improving slowly, with better control of bronchospasm and continued net diuresis. Sedatives have been discontinued, and the patient is expected to be extubated soon.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, indicating a systemic infection that needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver dysfunction leading to confusion and altered mental status. This can be exacerbated by sedation, so it is important to discontinue sedatives and use lactulose for treatment.
4. Pain Control: The patient may require pain management as needed.
5. Right Hip Infection: The patient had a right hip infection, and the hardware was removed. Antimicrobials should continue to be administered.
6. Fluid Balance: The patient hopes to continue net diuresis to manage fluid balance.
7. Epistaxis: The patient had epistaxis, which has resolved. Monitoring is necessary now that nasal packing has been removed.
8. Nutritional Support: The patient requires nutritional support through tube feeding (TF) via NGT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis who underwent a total hip replacement surgery. She is currently in the ICU due to progressive hypoxia and has been diagnosed with ESBL E. coli infection in her right hip. She also has acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, multifactorial in nature, and is on mechanical ventilation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 149/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is sedated and intubated.

Medical Complications:
1. Right Hip Infection: The patient has an infection caused by ESBL E. coli in her right hip. She underwent debridement and is receiving antibiotics as per ID recommendations for a total of 6 weeks.
2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is multifactorial including epistaxis, pulmonary edema, and infection. The infection has been ruled out as no growth was observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged INR of 2.3, likely due to liver disease and/or nutritional deficiency. She has not required fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion since the perioperative period.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis who underwent a total hip replacement and developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was intubated and transferred to the MICU. The patient has been diagnosed with ESBL E. coli infection of the right hip, which required removal of hardware. She has a history of asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and is a candidate for liver transplantation. The patient's current condition includes metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia. She is receiving meropenem and vancomycin for infection, lasix for fluid management, insulin for blood glucose control, and other medications for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli infection and is currently receiving meropenem and vancomycin. There is a potential risk of developing another infection due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration of lung function.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has HCV cirrhosis and a MELD score of 15-20, indicating significant liver dysfunction. She may be at risk of hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding varices, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who has undergone a total hip replacement surgery. She was admitted to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia and is currently extubated and on a 40% aerosolized face mask. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, infection (ESBL E. coli in the hip wound), anemia, coagulopathy, hepatic failure, adrenal insufficiency, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and fluid/acid-base status imbalance.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This can lead to further confusion, disorientation, and potential coma if not properly managed.

2. Infection (ESBL E. coli in the hip wound): There is a risk of spreading the infection or developing sepsis if not appropriately treated.

3. Anemia: If left untreated, it can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged INR indicate a bleeding risk. This increases the likelihood of bleeding from the hip wound or other sites.

5. Hepatic failure: This can progress to liver failure, leading to multiorgan dysfunction and increased mortality.

6. Adrenal insufficiency: Without appropriate management,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant and is currently in the ICU. She has been experiencing several medical complications, including acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, increased bowel movements, altered mental status, fluid/acid-base status, anemia, coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, adrenal insufficiency, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing, which is causing low oxygen levels in the blood. This can lead to organ damage and failure if not promptly addressed.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver dysfunction. It can result in confusion, disorientation, and even coma if left untreated.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and low platelet count, indicating impaired blood clotting. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics for an infection, but further investigations are needed to identify the causative organism and ensure appropriate treatment.
5. Fluid/Acid-Base Status: The patient's fluid and electrolyte balance is a concern, with close monitoring required to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or metabolic alkal"

   Coli of R hip, transferred to the MICU in the setting of progressive
   hypoxia now P.O.D. #5 for R ex-plant
   #S/P Ex-Plant: POD#5. + Hip drainage overnight following removal of
   VAC. Hip Cultures + for enterococcus, gram stain coag
 staph. Vanc
   Level 13.6 from 14 yesterday. Continues to have blood draining from
   wound, stable HCT, noted that patient
s INR is 2.2.
   -          Per ID, will change Vanc to q18hrs. Continue Meropenem. Recs
   for 6 weeks
   -          Closely being followed by Ortho; will d/w Ortho re PT/OT and
   re bleeding. Will follow HCTs in meantime.
   -          Cultures from procedure, all no growth. Prior hip cx ESBL E
   coli [**Last Name (un) 270**] to [**Last Name (un) 614**], on [**Last Name (un) **]
   -          Pain: continue fentanyl. Will start lidocaine patch (for
   back pain as well)
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial including, [**1-7**]
   from epistaxis, [**Doctor Last Name 11**], and pulmonary edema. Infection less likely given
   no growth from BAL. Extubated O/N. Clinical lung exam improved. ABG
   looks good, metabolic alkalosis with resp compensation.  CXR pending
   for today. Currently on Fi02 40% mask.
   - Wean to NC as tolerated.
   - F/u CXR read; CXR in am [**9-25**].
   -          Attempt to keep even with lasix IV PRN, will tolerate
   alkalemia as long as pt continues to blow off CO2
   -          Cont Meropenem / Vanc
   -          BAL finalized cultures neg so far
   #Increased Bowel Movements: Pt having [**2-7**] BMs without receiving
   lactulose. Afebrile. No abdominal pain. Tried small amount of soft food
   today despite NPO status. Cdif neg x1
   -F/u c diff cultures
   -Hold lactulose/bowel regimen for now.
   #AMS: Pt is confused and disorient to date and place. Most likely cause
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medication induced (eg: fentanyl),
   prolonged hospital stay.
   -Will continue to monitor mental status. No need for radiographic
   studies at head; will consider if mental status declines.
   # Fluid/Acid base Status: Pt remains close to 5L positive during LOS.
   Diuresed to improve pulmonary edema. Lung exam improved. Diuresis
   limited by acid-base status and alkalosis.
          -       I/O goal even with Lasix PRN
   -          Aggressive electrolyte repletion with KCl PRN
   -          Fluids changed to D5W- Trying to decrease IVF intake
   # Anemia: No subsequent events of Melena or epistaxis, HCT stable.
   -          Daily monitoring of Hcts.
   -          Liver Following
   -          Hct goal of 25.
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.2 today, stable, has not required FFP since
   periop. Likely [**1-7**] liver disease +/- nutritional deficiency given no
   nutrition since transfer until yesterday. No further epistaxis.
   Platelets low this am, s/p 1unit plt this am.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis and a history of TIPS placement, who was admitted to the ICU for progressive hypoxia. She underwent an ex-plant procedure and developed complications such as increased pain, tachycardia, hypertension, and respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical conditions including esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, anemia, coagulopathy, and depression/anxiety. She is also diagnosed with osteopenia and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and disorientation may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of liver cirrhosis. This condition can be exacerbated by medications like fentanyl.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli infection in her hip, and there is a concern for potential infections in the ICU setting, especially with the use of invasive lines and procedures.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can have multifactorial causes including pulmonary edema and infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient has had bleeding episodes, including epistaxis and blood draining from a wound, indicating a risk for further bleeding complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis who underwent TIPS and is now in the MICU.
- She has a history of esophageal varices and was admitted for progressive hypoxia, which is now POD #5 for right ex-plant.
- The patient's current conditions include acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, worsening right pleural effusion, and an episode of hematemesis.
- She has also been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, coagulopathy, adrenal insufficiency, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, and osteopenia.
- The patient received transfusions of 2 units of platelets and is currently on her 3rd unit.
- She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, pain management, and other supportive care.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- The patient's pain is not adequately controlled, and she requires ongoing management.
- The plan includes continuing meropenem and vancomycin, monitoring for any growth in the BAL cultures, addressing the worsening right pleural effusion, and providing further supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's acute hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- improved s/p extubation.  Current complaints
   may be due to CHF or right pleural effusion, and pain (leg & hip).  No
   active bronchospasm.  Consider therapeutic thoracentesis (CXR reveals
   layering right effusion).
   ASTHMA -- good control on current regimen.  Continue usual medications.
   RIGHT HIP INFECTION -- s/p removal of hardware, local depot placement.
   No plan for repeat surgical interventions soon.  Continue antibiotics.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- improved since d/c sedatives, started
   lactulose.
   EPISTAXIS -- improved.  s/p nasal packing.
   COAGULOPATHY -- improved INR.  Monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  Awaiting speech and swallow
   evalation.
   ADRENAL INSUFICIENCY -- continue usual chronic dose.
   PAIN CONTROL -- would optimize pain regimen.  Consider PCA pump,
   fentanyl patch, or adjusting PO regimen.
   CIRRHOSIS -- not listed currently, pending completion of infection
   therapy.

   layering right effusion).
   ASTHMA -- good control on current regimen.  Continue usual medications.
   RIGHT HIP INFECTION -- s/p removal of hardware, local depot placement.
   No plan for repeat surgical interventions soon.  Continue antibiotics.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- improved since d/c sedatives, started
   lactulose.
   EPISTAXIS -- improved.  s/p nasal packing.
   COAGULOPATHY -- improved INR.  Monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  Awaiting speech and swallow
   evalation.
   ADRENAL INSUFICIENCY -- continue usual chronic dose.
   PAIN CONTROL -- would optimize pain regimen.  Consider PCA pump,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis and a recent TIPS procedure. She was admitted to the MICU for progressive hypoxia and underwent right hip removal due to infection. The patient's current condition includes acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly caused by epistaxis, pulmonary edema, and stable right pleural effusion. Her other medical issues include anemia, coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, adrenal insufficiency, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and malnutrition.

The patient has shown some improvement, such as better controlled pain, improved mental status, and stable HCT. However, she still requires daily platelet transfusion and is at risk for further complications like FEN, electrolyte imbalances, and infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in achieving adequate oxygenation, as indicated by the need for increased FiO2 and the presence of pulmonary edema. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilation support are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with an ESBL-producing E. coli infection in the right hip, which required hip removal. Despite negative cultures from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), there is still a risk of developing other hospital-acquired infections. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who underwent a TIPS procedure. She was admitted to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia and is currently on POD#6. The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, worsening right pleural effusion, hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, coagulopathy, adrenal insufficiency, asthma, diabetes, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and electrolyte imbalance.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including epistaxis, pulmonary edema, and worsening right pleural effusion. She is currently on FiO2 60% via mask and requires close monitoring with serial ABGs.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient had mental status changes but has now improved with lactulose and rifaximin therapy. She will continue to be monitored for any signs of hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia has stabilized, with no further episodes of melena or epistaxis. Her HCT is being monitored daily, and her goal is to maintain a HCT of 25.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR has improved from 2.2 to 1.9 today. She received three units of platelets since yesterday"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has been extubated and remains on high flow nasal cannula oxygen. Vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 84-122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-186 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient has a history of shellfish allergy, rash with Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine Hcl), and unknown hepatic toxicity with tricyclic compounds. The patient has received antibiotics including vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and wheeze. The patient's pain level is reported as mild and located in the right hip. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal heart rhythm. The patient has poor dentition but no signs of endotracheal or nasogastric tubes. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse and no murmurs. The respiratory examination reveals symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds bilaterally, and diminished breath sounds on the right side. The abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 31,000/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 297 mg/dL, hyponatremia with sodium level of 103 mEq/L, elevated potassium level of 5.7 mEq/L, and decreased hematocrit of 26.2%. Other lab values show elevated creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL and lactic acid level of 1.3 mmol/L. Coagulation studies reveal an elevated prothrombin time (PT) of 20.8 seconds, elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 35.6 seconds, and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0.

The patient has a right pleural effusion, which may be contributing to dyspnea. The assessment and plan include continuing respiratory support, monitoring the patient's condition, and considering thoracentesis if a large collection of fluid is present.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, infection, thrombocytopenia, adrenal insufficiency, and possible complications related to the right hip infection and pleural effusion."

","The patient is a 49-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis who underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and is now in the MICU due to progressive hypoxia, which has led to the removal of her right hip. She is experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely multifactorial in nature. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/56 mmHg to 167/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. Her height is 62 inches, and she has a total intake of 3,067 mL and output of 3,480 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -413 mL. 

Physical examination reveals that she is extubated and wearing a facemask, with mildly icteric sclerae and clear mental status. She has mild inspiratory effort and scattered mild inspiratory wheezing, as well as decreased breath sounds on the right side. Her cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. Abdominally, her examination is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no hepatic stigmata or masses. She"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who underwent TIPS surgery. She was transferred to the MICU due to progressive hypoxia and is now post right hip removal. The patient is experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to multifactorial causes including pulmonary edema. She has a stable right pleural effusion and improved aeration on the left side. Her BAL cultures are negative so far.

The patient's recent events include not achieving her I/O goal of -1L, receiving Furosemide 80mg IV, being evaluated for potential thoracentesis, and having repeat CXR performed. She complains of pain everywhere and is tearful. 

The patient has allergies to shellfish, Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine Hcl), and hepatic toxicity from tricyclic compounds. Her last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on 09:00 AM 2158-9-25 and Meropenem on 06:00 PM 2158-9-26. She is currently on Furosemide (Lasix) IV.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax: 37.1 C (98.7 F), Tcurrent: 36.2 C (97.2 F), HR: 89 bpm (84-115), BP: 110/56 mmHg (77/102-167/83), RR: 13 inspirations per minute (10-18), and SpO2: 98%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show the following values: WBC: 9.3 K/uL, Hct: 26.4%, Plt: 48 K/uL, Cr: 0.5 mg/dL, TCO2: 42 mmol/L, Glucose: 123 mg/dL, PT/PTT/INR: 18.9/34.2/1.8, and LDH: 359 IU/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing this condition, which is characterized by severe hypoxia and poor oxygenation. It can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a stable right pleural effusion, which is an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. This can cause difficulty in breathing and may require thoracentesis for diagnosis and treatment.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 2.0 and requires daily platelets. She also has a history of bleeding from the surgical site, indicating a potential risk of bleeding due to impaired clotting function.

4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of HCV cir"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who underwent a total hip replacement and is now in the MICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in her lung exam. Her pleural effusion is stable, and no growth was observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures. She is currently on 40% FiO2 and nasal cannula oxygen, but did not achieve her I/O goal of -1L.

The patient also has several other medical conditions, including ESBL E. Coli of the right hip, hepatic encephalopathy/HCV cirrhosis, anemia, coagulopathy, adrenal insufficiency, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, GERD, depression/anxiety, osteopenia, and FEN (likely referring to fluid and electrolyte imbalance).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/56mmHg to 167/83mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for improved respiratory status.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, her blood glucose"

The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis who underwent TIPS and is currently in the ICU due to progressive hypoxia. She has been experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, with multifactorial causes including epistaxis, pulmonary edema, and a stable right pleural effusion. The patient's oxygenation improved with the use of FiO2 40% mask but did not achieve the desired intake/output goal of -1L. Her urine output has been 500cc per hour after receiving Lasix.

The patient also has an escherichia coli infection in her right hip, for which she had the implant removed. She is currently on meropenem and vancomycin. Her blood cultures from the bronchoalveolar lavage are negative so far. There is a possibility of right thoracentesis, which would require fresh frozen plasma and platelets. The patient's pain is better controlled with Oxycontin 20mg and Oxycodone for breakthrough pain.

The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, and her mental status is now clear. She is being monitored closely for liver function tests. She also has anemia with a hematocrit level of 26.4%. Her coagulopathy is managed with daily platelets and fresh frozen plasma as needed. She has completed stress dose steroids for adrenal insufficiency and is back on her home regimen of Prednis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory distress. The patient's right hip pain is being managed, and there have been no new events in the past 24 hours. The patient has a history of allergies to shellfish, rash from Flexeril, hepatic toxicity from tricyclic compounds, and unknown allergies. The patient was previously on antibiotics, including meropenem and vancomycin. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 100/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has an ABG result of ///39/. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal pupils, no conjunctival or scleral changes, normocephalic head, no cervical lymphadenopathy, normal cardiovascular examination, and clear breath sounds with no wheezing. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show trace edema bilaterally, and the patient has a disarticulated right hip. Neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 40 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 123 mg/dL, creatinine at 2"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several ongoing medical conditions. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which has shown improvement. The possible causes for the respiratory distress include congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A right pleural effusion is also present and needs to be evaluated for potential thoracentesis. The patient had a right hip infection, which resulted in the removal of hip hardware and placement of an antibiotic spacer. Antibiotic treatment for the hip infection should be continued. The patient previously had encephalopathy, likely due to an infection, but has shown improvement with the resolution of the infection and clearance of sedatives. Lactulose should be continued for this condition. Cirrhosis is mentioned but is currently off the treatment list. The patient desires a net negative fluid balance and should have their fluids managed accordingly. Nutrition should be provided through the patient's gastrointestinal tract (PO) rather than total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Pain control measures, including oxycontin and oxycodone, should be implemented. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."
