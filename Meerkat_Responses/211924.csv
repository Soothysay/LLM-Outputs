   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring until OR for closure
   1. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation
   awaiting return to OR
   - appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs
   - antibiotic coverage switch to vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID
   recommendations
   - follow-up peritoneal fluid cultures- still NGTD
   - leucocytosis improving; afebrile
   - will hold off on OR today per surgery to first remove fluid- patient
   with severe anasarca and volume overload
   2. Respiratory- alkalosis improved; last PH 7.38 with PO2 165
   - decrease FiO2 further to 30-35%
   - maintain sedation for OR
   3. Leukocytosis- improving.  Most likely GI source
   - cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID
   - fever curve improved
   - recent cultures NGTD; will need re-culture of peritoneal fluid in OR
   - pan-culture if spikes
   4. Anasarca
   - likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - will start furosemide gtt today for volume removal.  Goal -2L today.
   Titrate to goal I/O or UOP
   - d/w surger regarding amount of fluid removal for operative closure of
   abdominal wound
   5. [**Name (NI) 367**]
   Unclear etiology for patient's [**Name (NI) **]. Differential includes
   most likely elevated LFTs secondary to sepsis and rising LFTs.
   - continue to trend- improving
   - appreciate hepatology recs
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - alpha 1 antitrypsin- 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  cerruloplasmin pending
   6. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status earlier this admission,
   thought possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Reportedly much
   improved prior to return to OR.
   - continue to monitor
   - will consider re-evaluation once patient is s/p return to the OR
   7. Hypertension- previously HTN, but now normotensive to slightly
   hypotensive
   - con
t to hold HTN medications.  monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She also had small bowel obstruction that required resection and colostomy.
- The patient recently experienced a small bowel perforation, which was treated with resection and side-side anastomosis. She has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can undergo surgical closure.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped from 38 to 26, likely due to dilutional effects. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells as a transfusion.
- Antibiotic therapy was changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole based on the recommendations of the infectious disease team. Cultures from various sites are pending.
- The patient is well sedated and continues to be tachycardic. There has been some response to intravenous fluids and blood transfusion.
- Preliminary pathology results indicate a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).
- The patient's urine output has been maintained at greater than 60 cc/hour.
- The patient's blood sugar levels have been well-controlled without the need for insulin infusions.
- There are no known drug allergies.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from "

   6. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen

   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status earlier this admission,
   thought possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Reportedly much
   improved prior to return to OR.
   - continue to monitor
   - will consider re-evaluation once patient is s/p return to the OR
   .
   7. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension, although appears relatively
   well-controlled at this time. Given that she will go back to the OR and
   is normotensive now, will hold anti-HTN and give prn meds as needed.
   - continue to monitor and consider hydralazine or metoprolol prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She then experienced a small bowel obstruction that required resection and colostomy. Following this, she developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with resection and side-to-side anastomosis. The patient has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can return to the operating room for closure.

The patient's recent history includes a drop in hemoglobin from 38 to 26, which was likely partially dilutional and necessitated a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells. Her antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole per infectious disease recommendations.

The patient remains well sedated and continues to be tachycardic, although some response to IV fluids and blood transfusion has been observed. The preliminary pathology report indicates a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate between 97 and 127 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 132/63 to 150/100 mmHg, respiratory rate between 6 and 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) due to a pelvic mass. She then developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy. The patient recently experienced a small bowel perforation that required resection and side-to-side anastomosis. She has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can undergo surgical closure.

24-Hour Events:
- The arterial line was stopped at 11:59 PM.
- The patient started total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- Diuresis goal was set at 2 liters and was stopped at 2200 since the patient met the goal.
- The ID team recommended continuing current antibiotics and following cultures and narrowing as appropriate.
- The brachial arterial line was lost, and two attempts were made to replace the radial line before stopping. The patient's pressures are stable, and the line can be placed in the operating room today.

Allergies:
- No known drug allergies.

Medications:
- Daptomycin was administered on 02/29/2180 at 08:28 AM.
- Fluconazole was administered on 02/29/2180 at 09:28 AM.
- Metronidazole was administered on 02/29/2180 at 11:00 AM.

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She then developed a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy. Following that, she experienced a small bowel perforation after anastomosis and is currently in the ICU with an open abdomen, waiting for closure in the operating room (OR).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/61 to 106/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 25.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels of up to 0.4 mg/dL, low albumin levels at 1.6 g/dL, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The patient also has an altered mental status, but it has improved recently. She has a history of hypertension, which is currently being"

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), small bowel obstruction (SBO) resection and colostomy, and recent small bowel perforation repaired with side-to-side anastomosis. She has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can undergo surgical closure.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient had a small bowel perforation that was repaired but is still awaiting return to the operating room for closure.
2. Respiratory alkalosis: The patient's respiratory alkalosis has improved, and her PO2 is at 165. The plan is to decrease FiO2 further to 30-35% and maintain sedation for the operation.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis that is improving, likely due to a gastrointestinal source. Antibiotic coverage has been switched to vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluconazole per infectious disease recommendations.
4. Anasarca: The patient has severe anasarca and volume overload, likely from intravenous fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels. Furosemide will be started for volume removal, aiming for a goal of 2 liters today. The amount of fluid removal will be discussed with surgery for operative closure of the abdominal wound."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She also had a small bowel obstruction (SBO) that required resection and colostomy. Recently, she experienced a small bowel perforation, which was surgically repaired with side-to-side anastomosis. The patient has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can return to the operating room for closure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 111/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient is sedated and receiving continuous infusions of furosemide, fentanyl, and midazolam. She is also receiving TPN with lipids and has an IVC filter in place.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, but she has low albumin and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation awaiting return to OR for closure.
2. Respiratory- on"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She then developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy. However, she experienced a small bowel perforation and required another surgery for resection and side-to-side anastomosis. Currently, she has an open abdomen and is being monitored in the ICU until she can return to the operating room for closure.

The patient's recent events include being taken to the operating room but not having her abdominal wound closed due to edema. Surgery recommended a fluid restriction of -500 cc to -1 liter overnight and will re-evaluate in the morning. The patient should be completely sedated and on assisted controlled ventilation settings due to concerns for evisceration.

The patient has no known drug allergies. She received various antibiotics including daptomycin, metronidazole, meropenem, fluconazole, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is 36.6°C (97.9°F), current temperature is 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate is 85 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 74-101 bpm, blood pressure is 111/69 mmHg with a range of 94/53"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She then had a small bowel obstruction (SBO) that required resection and colostomy, followed by a small bowel perforation after anastomosis. The patient's current condition involves an open abdomen in the ICU, awaiting closure in the operating room (OR).

The patient is on minimal ventilatory support with sedation. Her leukocytosis is improving, likely from a gastrointestinal source. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics as per the Infectious Disease team's recommendations. The patient's recent cultures show no growth, and she is being monitored closely for any changes.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative goal of 2 liters, which is being achieved. Her hemodynamic monitoring indicates stable vital signs with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 142/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal limits at 10 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and hematocrit (Hct), while platelet count, creatinine, and blood glucose levels are within normal range. The liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, but improving. Imaging studies reveal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She subsequently developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and had surgical resection and colostomy performed. Recently, she experienced a small bowel perforation, which was also surgically managed with resection and side-side anastomosis. Currently, she has an open abdomen and is being monitored in the ICU until she is ready for closure in the operating room.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/79 to 144/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated and intubated on mechanical ventilation with minimal support settings.

Her fluid balance shows an input of 3,007 mL and output of 4,660 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,653 mL. She has received a total of 1,652 mL of IV fluids. Her urine output is 4,610 mL, and she has had 50 mL of NG drainage.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.8 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin at 9.2 g/dL, and normal platelet count of 269 K"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass (GIST tumor) who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She was later diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy. The patient also experienced a recent small bowel perforation, which was treated by resection and side-to-side anastomosis with an open abdomen in the ICU for monitoring until closure.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- The patient has anasarca with bowel edema, for which Lasix is being adjusted to manage volume offload. Her creatinine levels are stable, and bicarbonate and sodium levels are rising. Efforts are being made to close the abdomen in the morning.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to volume overload and sedation with an open abdomen. She is heavily sedated on fentanyl and midazolam, and artificial ventilation is being continued for now.
- The patient is also at risk of sepsis and hypotension, but her hemodynamics are currently acceptable. Antibiotic therapy is being continued.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Continued difficulty in closing the abdomen due to anasarca and bowel edema.
2. Respiratory failure due to volume overload and sedation with an open abdomen.
3. Sepsis and hypotension,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). She then developed a small bowel obstruction (SBO) that was treated with resection and colostomy. Subsequently, she experienced a small bowel perforation following a side-to-side anastomosis, leading to an open abdomen. 

The patient's current condition is critical with multiple issues. She has anasarca and bowel edema, and efforts are being made to manage fluid balance and prepare for closure of the abdomen. She is also experiencing respiratory failure due to volume overload and the need for continued sedation with an open abdomen. Additionally, she has a small bowel perforation that requires surgical intervention for closure. 

The patient has an improving leukocytosis, most likely originating from a gastrointestinal source, and is being treated with antibiotics as per the Infectious Disease recommendations. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, and her glycemic control is being closely monitored. She has multiple lines inserted for medication administration, and prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, stress ulcer"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small bowel obstruction, resection and colostomy, and recent small bowel perforation. The patient has undergone a side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. She is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can return to the operating room for closure. 

The patient has shown some improvement in her condition, including a decrease in leukocytosis and improvement in her fever curve. However, she still requires minimal ventilator support and is sedated. Her fluid balance has been monitored, and diuretics have been used to maintain negative fluid balance for another attempt at closure in the operating room. 

The patient also has an intrauterine device (IUD) in place due to a previous emergency situation. She has been on various medications, including antibiotics and pain management. Her nutrition is being provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient has a history of small bowel perforation, which resulted in an anastomosis. She is awaiting return to the operating room for closure. This complication can lead to peritonitis, sepsis, and further surgical intervention.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is improving. This may indicate an ongoing infection,"

   Unclear etiology for patient's [**Name (NI) **]. Differential includes
   most likely elevated LFTs secondary to sepsis and rising LFTs.
   - Continue to trend- improving
   - appreciate hepatology recs
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin- 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   6. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - Hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status earlier this admission,
   thought possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Reportedly much
   improved prior to return to OR, now sedated and unable to assess.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR
   8. Hypertension- previously HTN, but now normotensive to slightly

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a complex medical history including pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small bowel obstruction, resection, colostomy, small bowel perforation, and side-side anastomosis. The patient has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient has a small bowel perforation that occurred after anastomosis. She is awaiting a return to the operating room for closure.
2. Respiratory support: The patient is on minimal ventilator support settings and is sedated.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to a gastrointestinal source. She is being treated with antibiotics as per the infectious disease recommendations.
4. Anasarca: The patient has anasarca, which is likely caused by intravenous fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels. Her input/output goals are being monitored, and she is receiving 25% albumin every 8 hours.
5. Liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are slightly elevated, but improving. The cause is unclear, but could be secondary to sepsis or other factors. Further evaluation and hepatology recommendations are being followed.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient had an IVC"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) for a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). She then experienced small bowel obstruction (SBO) which was managed with resection and colostomy. Following that, she developed small bowel perforation, leading to an open abdomen and subsequent surgery for side-to-side anastomosis. 

The patient remains critically ill with several active issues:

1. Anasarca with bowel edema: The patient has been placed on aggressive diuresis to achieve fluid balance.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is volume overloaded and heavily sedated due to the open abdomen. Sedation with fentanyl (150 mcg/hour) and midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour is ongoing, and attempts to wean have been unsuccessful until the abdomen is closed.
3. Small Bowel Perforation: The patient is awaiting return to the operating room for closure. She is currently being managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole) per infectious disease recommendations.
4. Leukocytosis: This is improving and most likely of GI origin. The patient will continue with the same antibiotic regimen.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass (GIST tumor), who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and subsequently had a resection and colostomy performed. She also had a small bowel perforation, which was repaired through resection and side-to-side anastomosis. The patient's abdomen remains open due to an inability to close it, and she is currently in the ICU for monitoring.

The patient has several active issues, including anasarca with bowel edema, respiratory failure due to volume overload and sedation with an open abdomen, small bowel perforation, leukocytosis likely from a gastrointestinal source, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her various conditions. She is on mechanical ventilation with controlled mode ventilation (CMV) and assist/cycled mandatory ventilation (ASSIST). Her blood gases show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 45, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 425, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

She is receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, fluconazole, heparin sodium, acetazolamide, famotidine, and insulin. Her laboratory results indicate leukocyt"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass (GIST tumor) who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She then experienced a small bowel obstruction that required resection and colostomy. Subsequently, she developed a small bowel perforation that necessitated another surgery for resection and side-to-side anastomosis, resulting in an open abdomen. The patient remains critically ill with multiple issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anasarca with bowel edema: The patient has anasarca (generalized swelling) and bowel edema. Aggressive diuresis was attempted to achieve negative fluid balance, but contraction alkalosis ensued, so acetazolamide was used instead. The plan is to continue using Lasix unless contraction worsens.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing volume overload and is heavily sedated due to the open abdomen. Sedation will continue until the abdomen is closed.
3. Small bowel perforation: The patient has a small bowel perforation, which was addressed by planning for slow closure at the bedside.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, likely from a gastrointestinal source. Antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole) are being administered.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient had an IVC filter"

   Disposition: ICU, awaiting abdominal wound culture
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), who now presents with small bowel obstruction (SBO) that required resection and colostomy. The patient also had a small bowel perforation which was surgically repaired with side-side anastomosis. She currently has an open abdomen in the ICU for monitoring until she can undergo surgery for closure.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 137/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her temperature is slightly below normal at 36.6°C.

The patient has been undergoing autodiuresis, with approximately 5 liters of fluid being lost overnight. She is on minimal ventilator settings and awaiting another surgical procedure for closure of the abdominal wound.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and liver enzymes, but other parameters are within normal limits. Imaging and microbiology reports are pending.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition. These include:
1. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation awaiting return to OR for closure.
2. Respiratory support on minimal vent settings.
3. Leukocytosis improving"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), followed by small bowel obstruction (SBO) resection and colostomy. The patient then experienced a small bowel perforation, which required resection and side-side anastomosis. The abdomen remains open for monitoring until the patient can undergo surgery for closure.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is on minimal ventilator support. She is sedated and intubated. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 137/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 127 kg on admission to 126 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 4,859 mL since midnight, with total input of 3,841 mL and total output of 8,700 mL. The patient has received a total of 1,641 mL of intravenous fluids and 406 mL of blood products. Urine output has been good at 8,500 mL since midnight.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 229 K/uL and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 43/96, ALP: 77, Tbili: 2.9, Alb: 2.8). Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including a small bowel perforation, respiratory issues requiring minimal ventilator support, leukocytosis likely from a gastrointestinal source, anasarca likely due to IV fluids, low albumin, and deconditioning, liver function abnormalities with elevated liver enzymes, a possible DVT with an IVC filter in place, and altered mental status.

The patient's current plan includes continued monitoring until she can undergo surgery for abdominal wound closure. She will continue to receive IV antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluconazole) as per ID recommendations. The team will follow up on peritoneal fluid cultures and re-culture if necessary. The patient's I/O goals will be maintained, and she will receive 25% albumin q8H as recommended by surgery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She then developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy. Subsequently, she experienced small bowel perforation after anastomosis and is now in the ICU with an open abdomen, awaiting return to the operating room (OR) for closure. The patient has multiple medical complications including small bowel perforation, respiratory distress requiring minimal ventilator support, leukocytosis with possible gastrointestinal source, anasarca, liver dysfunction with unclear etiology, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient has an ongoing small bowel perforation that has not been closed yet. This could lead to further infection and sepsis if not addressed promptly.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is on minimal ventilator support, indicating respiratory distress. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and worsening respiratory function if not managed properly.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. The source of infection seems to be gastrointestinal, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued to control the infection.
4. Anasarca: The patient exhibits signs of anasarca, which is generalized edema."

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She then experienced small bowel obstruction and underwent resection and colostomy. However, she developed a small bowel perforation, which required resection and side-to-side anastomosis. The patient has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can undergo closure in the operating room. 

24-hour events include going to the operating room with no closure planned, autodiuresis of approximately 5 liters negative, minimal vent settings, and awaiting repeat OR for closure with surgery. The patient is on various medications including fluconazole, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, and other ICU medications. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), blood pressure of 137/83 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is 126 kg, and she has a height of 61 inches. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,841 mL and output of 8,700 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 4,859 mL. The patient is receiving TPN with lipids at a rate of 52 mL"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass (GIST tumor) s/p supracervical hysterectomy
   and BSO, c/b SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB
   perforation s/p SB resection and side-side anastomosis with open
   abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring until closure. [**3-5**] went to the OR and
   was unable to close.
   Pt remains critically ill with several active issues
   1.   Anasarca, with bowel edema.  Underwent aggressive diuresis to try
   to achieve neg fluid balance
 contraction alkalosis     ensued,
   switched to acetazolamide. Now autodiuresing rapidly. Frequent
   electrolyte checks. D/C
d albumin. Significant improvement in abd
   distension.
   2.  Resp Failure: volume overload, sedation with open abdomen.
         Heavily sedated on fent 250/versed 3
 continue AC for now
   cannot wean until abdomen is closed
   3. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
 now plan
   for slow closure at bedside
surgery following closely
   4. Leukocytosis- improving.  Most likely GI source
   - cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID (plan is until [**3-10**] for 10d course.)
   - fever curve improved
   - recent cultures NGTD; re-cultured.  NGTD.  Gram stain without
   organisms
   5. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen
   6. Trophic TF started.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass (GIST tumor) who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
- The patient developed a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy.
- She then experienced a small bowel perforation following the anastomosis and required another surgery for resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen.
- The patient remains critically ill with several active issues, including anasarca and bowel edema.
- The patient underwent aggressive diuresis, resulting in contraction alkalosis, and is now autodiuresing rapidly while being closely monitored for frequent electrolyte checks.
- The patient also has respiratory failure due to volume overload and sedation with an open abdomen.
- She is heavily sedated on fentanyl and midazolam and will continue to receive acetazolamide until the abdomen can be closed.
- The patient has a small bowel perforation from the anastomosis, and a plan for slow closure at the bedside with close monitoring by surgery has been made.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which is improving and likely of a gastrointestinal source.
- The patient is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole per ID plan until March 10th for a 10-day course.
- The patient had"

They are autodiuresing with a fluid balance of -4,859 mL over 24 hours. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 133/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 127 kg at admission to 92.5 kg currently. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 8 mmHg. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, fluconazole, midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with low sodium, potassium, and magnesium. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small bowel obstruction, resection, and colostomy. She recently experienced small bowel perforation and underwent resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can undergo primary closure surgery.

The patient's recent events include starting trophic tube feeds, which were discontinued due to high residuals. The plan is to restart tube feeds after administering Reglan. Tightening clamps on the abdomen will be done at the bedside, followed by primary closure later this week. The patient requires boluses of pain medication during repositioning.

Vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/96 to 116/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal issues, including leukocytosis that is improving, and has been growing yeast in peritoneal fluid cultures. She also has anasarca, which is improving, likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels. The patient's transaminitis is downtrending and may be secondary to sepsis.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small bowel obstruction, resection and colostomy, subsequent small bowel perforation, resection, and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen.
- The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can return to the operating room for closure.
- The patient has a small bowel perforation that is not healing, and she is awaiting return to the OR for closure.
- She has been diagnosed with peritonitis and an open abdomen.
- The patient has an altered mental status, which is thought to possibly be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. However, it has improved prior to the return to OR and now she is sedated and unable to assess.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which is improving and most likely has a GI source.
- She has been on minimal vent support settings and is sedated.
- The patient's electrolytes have been significant autodiuresis.
- Her albumin levels are low, and she has anasarca.
- She has had a liver biopsy done.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small bowel obstruction, resection and colostomy, recent small bowel perforation, and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring until the OR for closure.

The patient has been started on trophic tube feeds but discontinued due to high residuals. It is planned to restart tube feeds after tightening the clamps. The patient requires general anesthesia prior to instrumentation.

The patient is diuresing well with a urine output of 2.6L negative 3-6, and around 300cc UOP per hour. Allergies are not known.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3C (99.1F), heart rate of 75 bpm (65-86), blood pressure of 140/96 mmHg (107/110-154/96), respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute (11-21), and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 5.6-6.1 thousand/mm3, hematocrit of 27.2-28.3%, platelet count of 229-247 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 0.3-0.4 mg/dL, blood glucose"

   perforation s/p SB resection and side-side anastomosis with open
   abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring until closure. [**3-5**] went to the OR and
   was unable to close. Autodiuresis since then with marked improvement in
   anasarca and bowel edema.
    1.   Anasarca, with bowel edema. Plan for Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2093**] to pull wound
   closer this afternoon with transient propofol.
   2.  Resp Failure: volume overload, sedation with open abdomen.
         Minimal vent settings. No sig secretions. Heavily sedated on fent
   /versed
    3. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
 now plan
   for slow closure at bedside
surgery following closely
   4. Leukocytosis- resolved.  Most likely GI source
   - cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID (plan is until [**3-10**] for 10d course.)
   - afebrile
   5. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen
   6. Trophic TF started and failed. Will try again. TPN in meantime.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of GIST tumor, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She then experienced small bowel obstruction (SBO) that required resection and colostomy. Subsequently, she had a small bowel perforation which was treated with resection and side-side anastomosis, leaving her with an open abdomen.
- The patient is currently mechanically ventilated and heavily sedated on fentanyl and versed.
- She is experiencing autodiuresis, marked improvement in anasarca, and bowel edema.
- The patient has not tolerated trophic tube feeds and requires high doses of sedation.
- She has leukocytosis which has resolved, likely from a gastrointestinal source.
- The patient has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. Heparin has been held due to the persistently open abdomen.
- The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and has failed trophic tube feeds. TPN is being continued.
- The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anasarca and bowel edema: The patient's condition may progress to further fluid accumulation, leading to respiratory distress or heart failure."

   awaiting return to OR for closure
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs
   - [**Doctor First Name **] at bedside today for partial closure, patient required propofol
   and 1 dose vec for paralysis which she tolerated, plan for primary
   closure likely Thursday
   - Cont  vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID recommendations until [**3-10**].
   - Follow-up peritoneal fluid cultures. Repeated in OR growing [**Female First Name (un) 188**]

   been autodiuresing, lasix gtt prn to maintain goals, though will not
   likely require
   - PM lytes given significant autodiuresis
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On AC with minimal vent settings.  Sedated
   # Leukocytosis - Stable, improving.  Most likely GI source
   - Cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID as above
   - Fever curve continuing to improve
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above
   - Pan-culture if spikes
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Albumin25% q8H per surgery recommendations was dc'd yesterday.
   Trophic TF started yesterday with high residuals so was discontinued

   - Downtrending. Unclear etiology for patient's transaminitis.  Patient
   is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].  Differential includes most
   likely elevated LFTs secondary to sepsis.
   - No need to continue to follow unless clinically indicated
   - F/u results of liver biopsy

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She has undergone small bowel resection and colostomy, but experienced a small bowel perforation that required resection and side-side anastomosis. The patient currently has an open abdomen and is being monitored in the ICU until she can undergo closure in the operating room.

The patient attempted partial closure today with the assistance of propofol and a paralytic, which she tolerated. The plan is to attempt primary closure likely on Thursday. The patient is receiving IV Reglan to facilitate trial feedings, which will be re-attempted later this afternoon.

Her allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics given were fluconazole, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 119/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her current weight is 92.5 kg, compared to her admission weight of 127 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total in of 3,840 mL and total out of 5,830 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,990 mL. The patient's urine output is 5,370 mL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She had a small bowel obstruction that required resection and colostomy, followed by a small bowel perforation treated with resection and side-to-side anastomosis. The patient now has an open abdomen and is being monitored in the ICU until she can undergo surgery for closure. She has recently experienced a small bowel perforation and is awaiting a return to the operating room for closure. The patient's current condition includes leukocytosis, anasarca, transaminitis, DVT, altered mental status, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient has already experienced a small bowel perforation, which required surgical intervention. There is a risk of recurrent perforation or complications related to the anastomosis site.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection. The source of infection appears to be gastrointestinal. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or worsening infection is essential.
3. Anasarca: The patient exhibits signs of anasarca, which is generalized edema. This can be due to various factors such as hypoalbuminemia, fluid overload, or renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes is necessary.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver"

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She then had a small bowel obstruction (SBO) that required resection and colostomy.
- The patient also had a small bowel perforation after anastomosis, leading to an open abdomen and monitoring in the ICU.
- The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 6.1 to 9.1 K/uL, and improvement in anasarca with significant weight loss.
- The patient is currently on minimal ventilator support with sedation, and has been autodiuresing with goals of -2L daily. She is also receiving IV fluids and total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- The patient's transaminitis is downtrending, but the etiology remains unclear. Her liver function tests show slightly elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase.
- The patient had an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed due to emergent surgery, and is now on subcutaneous heparin.
- The patient's altered mental status is being re-evaluated once she returns to the operating room after closure and is able to be extubated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) for a pelvic mass. She subsequently developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy. The patient also had a small bowel perforation that required resection and side-to-side anastomosis. Due to significant edema, the abdomen could not be closed, and the patient is currently in the ICU with an open abdomen, with plans for staged closure using mesh.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient has an open abdomen due to the inability to close it because of significant edema. There is a plan to return to the operating room (OR) for complete closure after achieving adequate diuresis.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has improved leukocytosis, which is likely of gastrointestinal origin. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued as per Infectious Disease recommendations.
3. Fungal infection: The patient's peritoneal fluid is positive for Candida albicans. Cultures from urine, blood, and sputum are pending.
4. Anasarca: The patient has shown significant improvement in edema, likely due to intravenous fluids (IVFs), deconditioning, and low albumin levels. Diuretic therapy is ongoing to achieve a goal diuresis of -2"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She then developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and required resection and colostomy. Subsequently, she experienced a small bowel perforation, which was repaired with resection and side-to-side anastomosis. The patient has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU for monitoring. 

24-hour events include blood and sputum cultures being taken, unsuccessful attempts to close the abdomen due to significant edema, administration of blood and intravenous fluids, weaning off sedation and ventilation as tolerated, and the placement of an IVC filter due to an emergent operation.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current conditions include small bowel perforation with an open abdomen, inability to close the abdomen due to significant edema, concerns for pneumonia due to increased sputum production and fever, leukocytosis with improvement, anasarca (significant edema), transaminitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's open abdomen and recent surgeries put her at risk for infection. The presence of yeast in the peritoneal fluid suggests a possible fungal infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but additional monitoring and follow-up of cultures are needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Will dc vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Leukocytosis improved slightly, Tmax 100.4 yesterday morning, no
   fevers overnight. Was pancultured, all no growth to date. Will follow
   micro results.
   - Pt intubated >10 days, initial concern for VAP given increased
   sputum, low grade temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR
   and clinical status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - Continue to follow diuresis as patient rec'd 1.5L and 2units blood in
   OR yesterday, can consider lasix gtt again if becomes volume
   overloaded.  Goal I/O 500-1L negative today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On AC with minimal vent settings.  Sedated.
   - Given no further OR, will attempt change to PSV today and wean
   sedation (preferentially weaning versed as patient will likely require
   fentanyl for pain control given persistently open abdominal wound).
   # Leukocytosis - Stable, slight improvement today
   - No clear source of infection, CXR clear, clinically and HD stable.
   - D/C abx as above
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture if spikes
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Will re-attempt tube feeds today, will hold in the setting of high
   residuals.
   # Transaminitis
   - Was downtrending. Unclear etiology for patient's transaminitis.
   Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, now with
   some evidence of ?scleral icterus.  LFTs today showing slightly
   increased T. bili and LDH.  Can continue to monitor.
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds today, bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small bowel obstruction, resection and colostomy, and recent small bowel perforation with subsequent resection and side-to-side anastomosis. She has an open abdomen in the ICU for monitoring. The patient has multiple medical complications including small bowel perforation, anasarca (significant edema), leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count), transaminitis (liver function abnormalities), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), altered mental status, hypertension, and sedation dependence.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound Infection: Given the open abdomen and previous surgeries, there is a risk of wound infection. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive peritoneal fluid culture for Candida albicans suggest a possible infection.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for over 10 days, and there are signs of increased sputum production, low-grade fever, and leukocytosis, which may indicate VAP.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, especially considering the liver function abnormalities and the presence of scleral icterus.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She is currently in the ICU due to small bowel obstruction (SBO) and subsequent perforation after resection and colostomy. The patient has an open abdomen that could not be closed due to significant edema. The plan is to close the abdomen with mesh in stages and return to the operating room for complete closure after adequate diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has increased sputum production and a low-grade fever, which may indicate an evolving pneumonia. Broad coverage for atypical pathogens is recommended.
2. Yeast infection: The patient's peritoneal fluid is growing yeast, suggesting a fungal infection. Appropriate antifungal treatment should be initiated.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient is on minimal ventilator support settings and has been intubated for over 10 days. Weaning off sedation and ventilation should be attempted today.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which has slightly improved. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole) are being continued based on ID recommendations.
5. Anasarca: The patient has significant edema and anasarca, likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is the need for respiratory support in conjunction with an open abdomen and prolonged sedation. The patient has been in the ICU and received multiple interventions, including surgery, antibiotic administration, and respiratory support.

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient has an open abdomen with ongoing management using a woundvac.
- The patient is on prolonged mechanical ventilation due to critical illness.
- There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but the most recent chest X-ray appears to be unremarkable.
- The patient's sedation needs to be weaned off to facilitate extubation, but this will be limited by the prolonged sedation.
- The patient's abdominal wound was closed, but surgery does not plan to return to the operating room for closure at this time.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and slightly abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low magnesium levels.
- The patient's microbiology results are pending, but the peritoneal wash demonstrated yeast.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has an open abdomen, which increases the risk of infection. Additionally, there is a concern for VAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count, indicating possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Leukocytosis improved slightly, Tmax 100.4 yesterday morning, no
   fevers overnight. Was pancultured, all no growth to date. Will follow
   micro results.
   - Pt intubated >10 days, initial concern for VAP given increased
   sputum, low grade temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR
   and clinical status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning.
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate.
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP. HD
   stable. Low grade temperature to 100.2.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR clear, clinically and HD stable.
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture if spikes, can consider pan-cx today, repeat CXR.
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She then experienced a small bowel obstruction and underwent resection and colostomy. Subsequently, she developed a small bowel perforation after anastomosis and had an open abdomen. The patient has had multiple surgeries, including fascial closure in the operating room, and will have her abdomen close by secondary intention. She is currently in the ICU for monitoring.

Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient had a small bowel perforation that occurred after anastomosis. This resulted in the inability to close the abdomen due to significant edema. The patient underwent fascial closure in the operating room, and the abdomen will close by secondary intention.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing leukocytosis, which is an increased white blood cell count. This could indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
3. Fever: The patient has had a low-grade temperature, which may be indicative of an infection or other underlying condition.
4. Transaminitis: The patient exhibits signs of transaminitis, which is a decrease in liver function. The cause of this condition is unclear, and the patient had a liver biopsy to investigate further.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has reported altered mental status earlier during her admission, possibly secondary to hepatic encephal"

   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Leukocytosis improved slightly, Tmax 100.4 yesterday morning, no
   fevers overnight. Was pancultured, all no growth to date. Will follow
   micro results.
   - Pt intubated >10 days, initial concern for VAP given increased
   sputum, low grade temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR
   and clinical status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning.
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate.
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP. HD
   stable. Low grade temperature to 100.2.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR clear, clinically and HD stable.
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture if spikes, can consider pan-cx today, repeat CXR.
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable
   - Will recheck CBC this am
   - Transfuse for Hct <28
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She also had small bowel obstruction (SBO) that required resection and colostomy. Following this, she experienced a small bowel perforation which required resection and side-to-side anastomosis. Due to significant edema, the abdomen could not be closed, and it was decided to close it by secondary intention.

The patient is currently in the ICU with an open abdomen, intubated for over 10 days, and on minimal ventilator support. She has been sedated but is gradually being weaned off sedatives. The plan is to extubate her when possible.

The patient has been diagnosed with leukocytosis, anemia, anasarca (significant improvement), transaminitis, and altered mental status. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently on subcutaneous heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient had a recent SB perforation, which required surgical intervention. There is a risk of infection and further complications related to the perforation site.

2. Open abdomen: The patient's abdomen remains open due to significant edema. This increases the risk of infection, abscess formation, and difficulty in managing other medical conditions.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings. Pt intubated >10
   days, initial concern for VAP given increased sputum, low grade
   temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR and clinical
   status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning
   - CXR today to evaluate for evolving infiltrate
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP
   yesterday, but is high on the differential. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.3.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today
   - Add on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture today and with spikes
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable. [**Month (only) 60**] be dilutional as patient with less UOP and less
   hemoconcentrated as she is off lasix gtt and overall I/O positive.
   - Rechecked CBC and hct stable at 27
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - Results of liver biopsy showing non-specific process
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  At this time she is on minimal sedation and still
   unable to follow commands.  Also quite flaccid on exam with no movement
   in extremities
   -Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   - Will continue to monitor status over next few days and re-evaluate if
   still no purposeful movement or unable to follow commands off sedation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   - On fentanyl patch to wean drip, now down from 400mcg gtt to 50 with
   150 mcg patch.
   - Will turn off versed as on minimal dose with agitation or signs of
   discomfort. Will give prn versed for agitation or signs of benzo
   withdrawal
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small bowel obstruction, resection, colostomy, and recent small bowel perforation. She underwent a fascial closure in the operating room and now has an open abdomen, which will close by secondary intention.

The patient has been intubated for over 10 days and is currently on minimal ventilatory support. She has been sedated but is slowly being weaned off sedatives. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to increased sputum production, low-grade temperature, and leukocytosis. However, the chest X-ray does not show any signs of VAP at this time.

The patient has leukocytosis and was previously on antibiotics, but they were discontinued as she completed a 10-day course. There is no clear source of infection, but peritoneal fluid is growing yeast, so it is being monitored. A pan-culture has been ordered.

The patient has anemia with a slightly decreased hemoglobin concentration. No clear source of bleeding has been identified, and she has received two units of blood transfused. The anemia may be dilutional due to decreased urine output and hemodilution from intravenous fluids.

The patient has significant edema or anasarca, which is improving. It is likely due to intravenous fluids"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old female who has undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and small bowel resection with subsequent small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient's current condition includes hypotension and respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation with minimal respiratory support (MMV mode). The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, with a heart rate between 101-120 beats per minute. Blood pressure is relatively stable, ranging from 113/60 to 152/101 mmHg. Respiratory rate is set at 15 breaths per minute, with spontaneous respiration not observed. Oxygen saturation remains at 100%.

The patient has experienced several complications since admission. These include attempted tube feeding with high residuals, failure to wean off ventilation support, sedation weaning, and an increasing leukocyte count with unclear source. Cultures have been obtained and are pending.

The patient's laboratory values indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. Imaging studies reveal a non-specific liver biopsy.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure requiring continued ventilator support, leukocytosis with pending cultures, nutrition via total parenteral nutrition (TPN), bowel perforation with ongoing wound vacuum changes, mental status alteration due to continuous sedation, anemia with a decreasing"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings. Pt intubated >10
   days, initial concern for VAP given increased sputum, low grade
   temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR and clinical
   status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning
   - CXR today to evaluate for evolving infiltrate
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP
   yesterday, but is high on the differential. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.3.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today
   - Add on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture today and with spikes
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable. [**Month (only) 60**] be dilutional as patient with less UOP and less
   hemoconcentrated as she is off lasix gtt and overall I/O positive.
   - Rechecked CBC and hct stable at 27
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - Results of liver biopsy showing non-specific process
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  At this time she is on minimal sedation and still
   unable to follow commands.  Also quite flaccid on exam with no movement
   in extremities
   -Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   - Will continue to monitor status over next few days and re-evaluate if
   still no purposeful movement or unable to follow commands off sedation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   - On fentanyl patch to wean drip, now down from 400mcg gtt to 50 with
   150 mcg patch.
   - Will turn off versed as on minimal dose with agitation or signs of
   discomfort. Will give prn versed for agitation or signs of benzo
   withdrawal
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. They have been receiving sedatives and are now more alert. Blood cultures were taken on 03/11/2180 at 10:00 AM and 10:15 AM. The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate (tachycardia), increased blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. They were extubated today. The patient has no known drug allergies and received antibiotics yesterday. They are currently on multiple medications, including hydralazine, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin sodium, and midazolam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures were taken due to suspected infection. The results are pending, but if the cultures come back positive, it could indicate a serious infection requiring immediate treatment.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may lead to complications such as organ damage or poor tissue perfusion if not managed properly.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently high, indicating tachycardia. This could be a response to stress, fever, or an underlying cardiac condition. Continuous monitoring is necessary to assess for any rhythm abnormalities or signs of worsening cardiac function.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative fluid balance. This may"

   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings. Pt intubated >10
   days, initial concern for VAP given increased sputum, low grade
   temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR and clinical
   status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning
   - CXR today to evaluate for evolving infiltrate
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP
   yesterday, but is high on the differential. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.3.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today
   - Add on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture today and with spikes
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable. [**Month (only) 60**] be dilutional as patient with less UOP and less
   hemoconcentrated as she is off lasix gtt and overall I/O positive.
   - Rechecked CBC and hct stable at 27
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - Results of liver biopsy showing non-specific process
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  At this time she is on minimal sedation and still
   unable to follow commands.  Also quite flaccid on exam with no movement
   in extremities
   -Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   - Will continue to monitor status over next few days and re-evaluate if
   still no purposeful movement or unable to follow commands off sedation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   - On fentanyl patch to wean drip, now down from 400mcg gtt to 50 with
   150 mcg patch.
   - Will turn off versed as on minimal dose with agitation or signs of
   discomfort. Will give prn versed for agitation or signs of benzo
   withdrawal
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of small bowel perforation, resection, and anastomosis, which increases the risk of infection. The presence of yeast in peritoneal fluid suggests a possible fungal infection. The patient's leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) also indicates an ongoing infection. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

2. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests show elevated transaminase levels, suggesting hepatic dysfunction. The liver biopsy indicates acute cholestatic liver injury, which may be secondary to acute extra-hepatic biliary obstruction, drug effect ascending cholangitis, or systemic illness (e.g., sepsis). Close monitoring of liver enzymes and symptoms of liver dysfunction is necessary.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated up to 170/100s, indicating hypertension. The patient is already on a three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home. It is important to manage the patient's hypertension to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased slightly, indicating anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of anemia and appropriate management options.

5. Nausea and vomiting: The patient is experiencing"

   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - Results of liver biopsy showing non-specific process
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  At this time she is on minimal sedation and still
   unable to follow commands.  Also quite flaccid on exam with no movement
   in extremities
   -Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   - Will continue to monitor status over next few days and re-evaluate if
   still no purposeful movement or unable to follow commands off sedation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   - On fentanyl patch to wean drip, now down from 400mcg gtt to 50 with
   150 mcg patch.
   - Will turn off versed as on minimal dose with agitation or signs of
   discomfort. Will give prn versed for agitation or signs of benzo
   withdrawal
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen now extubated.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.   Patient had
   apparently had undetected perforation for several days when she
   initially presented. Now with tachycardia (see below), concern for
   other abdominal event.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - CT abdomen with contrast today to evaluate for possible perforation
   given current clinical status
   - Will touch base with heme/onc tomorrow to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status.
   - Goal I/O even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.  CXR
   clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course. Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious
   for VAP. HD stable. Still with low grade temperature to 100.  Concern
   as above for intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CT abdomen as above
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting and while there is surgical concern for
   perforation
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.  However, she has not been adequately
   anticoagulated for her DVT.
   - CIWA scale with valium, will load her this morning and assess for
   improvement.
   - Will get CTA along with abdominal CT as above to rule out PE and
   perforation as sources of tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Slightly increased over the last few days
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - After discussion with surgery, will start patient on heparin gtt once
   perforation ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation given
   known DVT.
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She then experienced a small bowel obstruction and underwent resection and colostomy. The patient also had a small bowel perforation, which was followed by a resection and side-to-side anastomosis with an open abdomen.

Currently, the patient is extubated but experiencing delirium. She is being monitored in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and confusion. She is also persistently vomiting throughout the day and has an NG tube in place.

The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.9 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and altered kidney function (creatinine). Her electrolytes show imbalances in sodium, potassium, and chloride levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include several ongoing concerns. Firstly, she has a small bowel perforation from a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), and the abdomen will close by secondary intention. The patient's tachycardia is not responsive to fluid boluses, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. There is a concern for intra-abdominal pathology, and a CT abdomen with contrast is planned.

The patient's nausea and vomiting may be due to ileus, medication reactions,"

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), small bowel obstruction (SBO) with subsequent resection and colostomy, and recent small bowel perforation requiring resection and side-side anastomosis. She has an open abdomen due to significant edema and is currently in the ICU for monitoring. The patient was recently extubated and is experiencing tachycardia, hypertension, confusion, and tremors. She has persistent vomiting and is on antiemetics. Her abdominal cavity is being treated with a wound vacuum to promote healing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal event: The patient's history of small bowel perforation and ongoing open abdomen raises concerns about potential intra-abdominal pathology. A CT abdomen with contrast is planned to evaluate for possible perforation given her current clinical status.
2. Respiratory issues: Although the patient has been extubated, there is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her elevated white blood cell count and low-grade fever. However, her chest X-ray is clear, and there is no sputum production suspicious for VAP.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count remains elevated, but antibiotics have been discontinued after completing a 10-day course. Oxygenation is good, and there are no signs of increased sputum production or focal infiltrate on the chest X-ray.
4. Nausea and vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which could be due to ileus/SBO, medication reactions (especially opiates), or surgical manipulation. Antiemetics are being given as needed, and the nasogastric tube is in place with confirmed position on chest X-ray.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains elevated and is not responsive to intravenous fluids. Urine output is still adequate. The possible etiologies include benzodiazepine withdrawal, pulmonary embolism (PE), or another abdominal event. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) will be performed along with the abdominal CT to rule out PE and perforation as sources of tachycardia.
6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and she will be transfused if there is hemodynamic instability or an acute drop in Hct. Guaiac testing of ostomy output should be done, and the patient will continue to be monitored.
7. Anasarca: The patient has shown significant improvement in her edema, likely due to intravenous fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels. Her input/output goals remain the same, and she is unable to tolerate oral fluids due to high residuals. Bowel function should be closely monitored.
8. Transaminitis:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to a pelvic mass. She then developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) after resection and colostomy, followed by a small bowel perforation after side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. The abdomen was unable to be closed due to significant edema, but a fascial closure was performed in the operating room. The decision was made not to close the abdomen further and instead allow it to heal by secondary intention. The patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and peritoneal fluid is growing yeast, suggesting a fungal infection.

The patient is extubated and currently on 2L nasal cannula. Her white blood cell count remains elevated, but antibiotics were discontinued as she completed her course. She is oxygenating well and showing no signs of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is no clear source of infection, and a chest X-ray showed no focal infiltrate. The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which could be attributed to ileus, prolonged fentanyl use, surgical manipulation, or medication reactions, particularly opiates. A nasogastric tube has been placed and confirmed on chest X-ray.

The patient has been tachycardic throughout the day and into the night, unresponsive to fluid boluses. She has adequate urine output, but her blood pressure has"

   increased sputum production suspicious for VAP. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.9.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.
   - CIWA scale
   - Consider CTA to rule out PE if no improvement on benzos (ativan vs
   valium)
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) due to a pelvic mass. She then developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy. Subsequently, she experienced a small bowel perforation, which required resection and side-to-side anastomosis. The patient has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU for monitoring.

24-hour events:
- The patient was extubated yesterday morning.
- She is hypertensive despite being on three oral antihypertensive agents at home. Currently, she has ileus and is receiving intravenous hydralazine every six hours for blood pressure control.
- The patient remains tachycardic and did not respond to fluid boluses. Her urine output is still within normal limits. She has been vomiting throughout the day and received antiemetics, but she appears to be more confused, hypertensive, and tremulous, possibly indicating benzodiazepine withdrawal.
- Her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is stable.

Assessment and Plan:

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a GIST tumor resection and subsequently developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) with subsequent resection and colostomy. The patient also has an open abdominal wound. She is currently in the ICU with ongoing mental status changes, confusion, and tachycardia that is unresponsive to fluids. She has persistent nausea and vomiting (N/V), and her vital signs show tachycardia and hypertension. The patient has a history of bowel perforation and previous episodes of SBO, which were not associated with pain. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly low sodium levels. The patient has an elevated creatinine level and normal glucose levels. The assessment and plan include concerns for SBO perfusion, mental status changes, respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypertension. The patient is on TPN, has an IVC filter in place, and is receiving prophylactic medications for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent resection of a GIST tumor and subsequently experienced small bowel obstruction (SBO) with subsequent resection and colostomy. The patient also has an open abdominal wound. The patient was extubated yesterday and restarted on hydralazine for blood pressure control. She remains tachycardic and unresponsive to fluids, with persistent nausea and vomiting (N/V). 

The patient has no known drug allergies. Her last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2180-3-13**]. The patient is currently receiving several medications, including Famotidine, Heparin Sodium, and Lorazepam.

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, are unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111 to 119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has decreased from 127 kg to 92.5 kg since admission.

Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, with total input and output balances showing positive fluid balance. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids, but there is no information provided about her urine output."

   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen now extubated.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.   Patient had
   apparently had undetected perforation for several days when she
   initially presented. Now with tachycardia (see below), concern for
   other abdominal event.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - CT abdomen with contrast today to evaluate for possible perforation
   given current clinical status
   - Will touch base with heme/onc tomorrow to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status.
   - Goal I/O even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.  CXR
   clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course. Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious
   for VAP. HD stable. Still with low grade temperature to 100.  Concern
   as above for intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CT abdomen as above
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting and while there is surgical concern for
   perforation
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.  However, she has not been adequately
   anticoagulated for her DVT.
   - CIWA scale with valium, will load her this morning and assess for
   improvement.
   - Will get CTA along with abdominal CT as above to rule out PE and
   perforation as sources of tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Slightly increased over the last few days
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - After discussion with surgery, will start patient on heparin gtt once
   perforation ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation given
   known DVT.
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She then experienced a small bowel obstruction (SBO) that required resection and colostomy. Subsequently, she developed a small bowel perforation after anastomosis due to a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The patient had an open abdomen and was monitored in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient had an undetected perforation for several days before presenting with symptoms. She underwent surgical intervention to close the abdomen, but it could not be completely closed due to significant edema. The plan is for the abdomen to close by secondary intention.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, which has not responded to intravenous fluids (IVF). Possible etiologies include benzo withdrawal, pulmonary embolism (PE), or another abdominal event. Further evaluation with a CT abdomen and chest CT (CTA) is planned to rule out PE and perforation as sources of tachycardia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) remains elevated despite completing a 10-day course of antibiotics. There is no clear source of infection, and the patient is oxygenating well without increased sputum production suspicious for ventil"

   given current clinical status
   - Will touch base with heme/onc tomorrow to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status.
   - Goal I/O even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.  CXR
   clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course. Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious
   for VAP. HD stable. Still with low grade temperature to 100.  Concern
   as above for intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CT abdomen as above
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential

   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting and while there is surgical concern for
   perforation

   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.  However, she has not been adequately
   anticoagulated for her DVT.
   - CIWA scale with valium, will load her this morning and assess for
   improvement.
   - Will get CTA along with abdominal CT as above to rule out PE and
   perforation as sources of tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function

   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - After discussion with surgery, will start patient on heparin gtt once
   perforation ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation given
   known DVT.
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) due to a pelvic mass. She then developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy. Subsequently, she experienced a small bowel perforation following anastomosis from a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The abdomen was left open due to significant edema, and the patient was extubated.

Current assessment:
- The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating leukocytosis.
- She has been on antibiotics for 10 days but still shows no clear source of infection.
- Her temperature is slightly elevated, and she is experiencing low-grade fever.
- She has tachycardia, which is not responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).
- She has anemia with a stable hematocrit (Hct) level.
- She has anasarca, which is improving due to intravenous fluids (IVFs).
- She has transaminitis, with slightly increased liver enzymes over the last few days.
- She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place.
- She is hypertensive but stable on a three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.
- She is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is holding tube feeds (TF) due to nausea and vomiting.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient had a small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from a GIST. The abdomen was left open due to significant edema, and the patient underwent fascial closure in the OR. There are concerns about other abdominal events, such as perforation or intra-abdominal pathology.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating leukocytosis. Despite being on antibiotics for 10 days, there is no clear source of infection. There is a concern for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia that is not responsive to IVF. Possible etiologies include benzo withdrawal, pulmonary embolism (PE), or other abdominal events.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a stable Hct level. She may require blood transfusion for hemodynamic instability or acute drop in Hct.

5. Anasarca: The patient has significant edema and anasarca, likely due to IVFs, deconditioning, and low albumin levels.

6. Transaminitis: The patient has slightly increased liver enzymes over the last few days. This may be due to a systemic process such as sepsis, hypotension, or drug effect. Hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided, and liver function should be closely monitored.

7. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and an IVC filter in place. She will start on heparin gtt once perforation is ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation.

8. Hypertension: The patient has stable hypertension on a three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home. IV antihypertensive medication will be given due to ileus and concerns about medication absorption.

9. Nausea/vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be due to ileus/SBO, medication reaction, or surgical manipulation.

10. Respiratory issues: The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation but is now extubated. She is sating well on 2L nasal cannula"

   1. Status post TAH-BSO and GIST tumor removal , there are now multiple
   fluid
   collections within the peritoneal cavity-in the left anterior pararenal
   space,
   within the root of the mesentry and in the surgical resection site at
   the base
   of the bladder.
   2. No pulmonary embolism is noted within the main pulmonary artery and
   its
   main branches. The evaluation for subsegmental pulmonary embolism was
   limited
   due to motion and poor bolus.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to a pelvic mass. She also had small bowel obstruction and resection with colostomy, as well as resection of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The patient now presents with an open abdomen due to small bowel perforation post-anastomosis. She has been unable to close the abdomen due to significant edema. The patient has been extubated but continues to have low-grade temperatures, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and tachycardia.

Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient had a small bowel perforation post-anastomosis, which resulted in an open abdomen. This complication is concerning for an abscess and may be the source of her fever and leukocytosis.
2. GIST tumor: The patient had a resection of a GIST tumor. Further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the tumor and potential spread.
3. Anasarca: The patient had significant edema and anasarca, likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, which is not responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). Urine output remains adequate.
5. Nausea/vomiting: The patient is experiencing"

   the base
   of the bladder.
   2. No pulmonary embolism is noted within the main pulmonary artery and
   its
   main branches. The evaluation for subsegmental pulmonary embolism was

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She then had a small bowel obstruction that required resection and colostomy. Following this, she developed a small bowel perforation, which was repaired but resulted in an open abdomen. The patient has been in the ICU for monitoring and has been extubated. She continues to have low-grade temperatures and elevated white blood cell count. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current diagnosis includes multiple fluid collections within the peritoneal cavity, small left pleural effusion, small bowel perforation, and GIST tumor removal. The plan includes starting cipro/flagyl for suspected small bowel perforation, holding tube feeds, and changing the vacuum dressing every three days. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and she has been extubated. She is also being treated for nausea/vomiting, tachycardia, anemia, anasarca, transaminitis, DVT, hypertension, and fenestration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of an infection. The presence of abscesses in the peritoneal cavity also increases the risk of infection.
2. Small bowel perforation: The patient has already experienced a small bowel perforation, which can lead to peritonitis and sepsis if"

   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen now extubated.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.   Patient had
   apparently had undetected perforation for several days when she
   initially presented. Now with tachycardia (see below), concern for
   other abdominal event.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - CT abdomen with contrast today to evaluate for possible perforation
   given current clinical status
   - Will touch base with heme/onc tomorrow to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status.
   - Goal I/O even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.  CXR
   clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course. Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious
   for VAP. HD stable. Still with low grade temperature to 100.  Concern
   as above for intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CT abdomen as above
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting and while there is surgical concern for
   perforation
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.  However, she has not been adequately
   anticoagulated for her DVT.
   - CIWA scale with valium, will load her this morning and assess for
   improvement.
   - Will get CTA along with abdominal CT as above to rule out PE and
   perforation as sources of tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Slightly increased over the last few days
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - After discussion with surgery, will start patient on heparin gtt once
   perforation ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation given
   known DVT.
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She had subsequent small bowel obstruction (SBO) and required resection and colostomy. The patient then developed small bowel perforation due to a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), leading to an open abdomen. She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever with a spike at 101.3°F
- Tachycardia
- Hypertension
- Elevated white blood cell count
- Anemia
- Anasarca
- Transaminitis
- History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place

Assessment and Plan:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient had an undetected perforation that resulted in an open abdomen. She underwent surgical intervention, but due to significant edema, the abdomen was not closed. Instead, it will heal by secondary intention. A CT scan of the abdomen will be performed today to evaluate for any further perforation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count remains elevated. Antibiotics were discontinued after completing a 10-day course. Oxygenation is good, and there are no signs of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a GIST tumor resection and subsequently experienced a small bowel obstruction (SBO) that required surgical resection and colostomy. She also has an open abdominal wound and was extubated on [**3-12**] with ongoing mental status changes/confusion. 

The patient presented with a fever of 101.3°F and a CT scan revealed multiple small abscesses in the peritoneal cavity. A liver biopsy showed nonspecific findings. 

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is elevated at 38.5°C (101.3°F), blood pressure is 147/92 mmHg, heart rate is 126 bpm, respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but creatinine (Cr) levels are slightly elevated. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos)/total bilirubin (T Bili), amylase/lipase, and electrolytes are also provided. 

Imaging studies include an ultrasound that did not show any stones. 

The patient's medical history includes GIST tumor resection, SBO"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Status post TAH-BSO and [**Month/Day/Year **] tumor removal , there are now multiple
   fluid collections within the peritoneal cavity-in the left anterior
   pararenal space, within the root of the mesentry and in the surgical
   resection site at the base of the bladder.
   2. No pulmonary embolism is noted within the main pulmonary artery and
   its main branches. The evaluation for subsegmental pulmonary embolism
   was limited due to motion and poor bolus.
   3.High density material around the liver was not present on prior
   studies and
   raises the possiblity of leak.
   4. Small left pleural effusion.

   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen now extubated but continues to have low
   grade temps
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/[**Hospital Unit Name **]: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR.  CT
   abdomen with leak concerning for small bowel perf. Also concerning for
   small abscesses per radiology read.
   - Hold off on tube feeds for now.  Per surgery, started on vanc/zosyn
   for bowel perf, low temps, elevated WBC. No plans for debridement
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Heme/onc consult for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] be staffed today
   - Goal I/O even
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. CXR clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated, trending down slightly.
   Discontinued antibiotics after 10 day course, restarted vanc/zosyn
   [**2180-3-14**] as above.
   - Likely abdominal (abscess, perf) source of fever and leukocytosis, ?
   CVL as source, though no positive blood cultures
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   - Will attempt to have PICC placed today and remove line if possible,
   or wait for patient to be on abx for 24 hours
   # Nausea/vomiting:  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   - NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   - Hold TF while there is perforation
   - Antiemetics PRN
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   - CIWA scale with valium, has been 0-1 on scale throughout most of the
   day.  Delerium improving but continues to be tachycardic
   - CTA without evidence of PE
   # Anemia: Hct stable over last several days.
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output- guaiac positive.  But hct stable
   - Continue to monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement.
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   # Transaminitis
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend, increased slightly over last
   few days
   # DVT- new LUE swelling, US negative for DVT.  Patient was previously
   maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter placed in the setting of
   emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Holding off on hep gtt given ? perf and guaiac positive stools
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She then experienced a small bowel obstruction that required resection and colostomy. Subsequently, she developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with resection and side-to-side anastomosis. The patient's abdomen remains open due to significant edema, and she is currently being monitored in the ICU.

The patient has been extubated but continues to experience low-grade temperatures. She has multiple fluid collections within the peritoneal cavity, including in the left anterior pararenal space, root of the mesentery, and surgical resection site at the base of the bladder. No pulmonary embolism was noted, but there is a small left pleural effusion. The patient also has a high density material around the liver, raising the possibility of a leak.

The patient's WBC count remains elevated, and she has been experiencing leukocytosis. She has been on a course of antibiotics for 10 days, which was recently changed to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to the presence of fluid collections and concern for bowel perforation. The patient's blood cultures have been negative except for one positive result for yeast in the peritoneal fluid.

The patient's nausea and vomiting are likely due to a component of ileus caused by prolonged fentanyl use and"

   hysterectomy and BSO, c/b SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with
   recent SB perforation s/p SB resection and side-side anastomosis with
   open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring, now extubated with delirium.
   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2180-3-14**] 04:35 PM
   - Surgery recommended holding off on TFs for now since she has a
   ""contrast leak"" concerning for perforation again.  Also, with fluid
   collection/abscessess, recommended starting vanco/zosyn.
   - If afebrile x 24 hrs, will place PICC, otherwise, will need new CVL.
   Unlikely though that CVL is source of infection, likely abdomen and all
   blood cultures have been NGTD
   - No DVT in LUE
   - Fentanyl patch decreased to 100 mcg.  Also started on morphine IV PRN
   - No physical therapy per PT at this time as surgery does not want
   patient to use her abdominal muscles (high risk for dehiscence)

   CVL as source, though no positive blood cultures
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   - Will attempt to have PICC placed today and remove line, will send for
   culture once removed
   # Nausea/vomiting:  Resolved.  Likely due to component of ileus in
   setting of prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may
   be rxn to meds, esp opiates.  Tolerated tube feeds yesterday until
   stopped due to question of perf, now tolerating NGT to gravity
   - NGT in place, continue trial to gravity and consider removal later
   today or tomorrow if no further nausea

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She also had a small bowel obstruction (SBO) that required resection and colostomy. The patient recently experienced a small bowel perforation which was repaired through side-to-side anastomosis. She now has an open abdomen and is being monitored in the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes a fever with low-grade temperatures, delirium, and tachycardia. Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 146/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is extubated but continues to experience delirium.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.9 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 2.3 mmol/L, and low albumin level of 2.6 g/dL. Imaging studies reveal multiple fluid collections within the peritoneal cavity, indicating possible abscesses or leaks. There is also a small left pleural effusion noted.

The assessment and plan include concerns about small bowel perforation and abscesses, necessitating the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass and subsequent surgeries including a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). The patient underwent small bowel obstruction (SBO) resection and colostomy, followed by small bowel resection and side-to-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring due to the open abdomen.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient has a small bowel perforation that occurred after the anastomosis. This has resulted in fluid collections within the peritoneal cavity and the formation of abscesses.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an infection or inflammatory response.

3. Fever: The patient has low-grade fevers, which may be due to the infection or inflammation.

4. Nausea and vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, likely due to a component of ileus caused by prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation.

5. Tachycardia: The patient is tachycardic and unresponsive to intravenous fluids. This could be due to benzo withdrawal or another underlying cause.

6. Anemia: The patient has a stable hematocrit (Hct) level, indicating that she does not require immediate blood transfusion. However, active monitoring"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Status post TAH-BSO and [**Month/Day/Year **] tumor removal , there are now multiple
   fluid collections within the peritoneal cavity-in the left anterior
   pararenal space, within the root of the mesentry and in the surgical
   resection site at the base of the bladder.
   2. No pulmonary embolism is noted within the main pulmonary artery and
   its main branches. The evaluation for subsegmental pulmonary embolism
   was limited due to motion and poor bolus.
   3.High density material around the liver was not present on prior
   studies and
   raises the possiblity of leak.
   4. Small left pleural effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with [**Month/Year (2) **] s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b SBO s/p
   resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB resection
   and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring
   given open abdomen now extubated but continues to have low grade temps
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/[**Hospital Unit Name **]: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR.  CT
   abdomen with leak concerning for small bowel perf. Also concerning for
   small abscesses per radiology read.
   - Hold off on tube feeds for now.  Per surgery, started on vanc/zosyn
   for bowel perf, low temps, elevated WBC. No plans for debridement
   - Vanc/zosyn as above
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Heme/onc consult for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] be staffed today
   - Goal I/O even
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. CXR clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated, trending down slightly.
   Discontinued antibiotics after 10 day course, restarted vanc/zosyn
   [**2180-3-14**] as above.
   - Likely abdominal (abscess, perf) source of fever and leukocytosis, ?
   CVL as source, though no positive blood cultures
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   - Will attempt to have PICC placed today and remove line, will send for
   culture once removed
   # Nausea/vomiting:  Resolved.  Likely due to component of ileus in
   setting of prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may
   be rxn to meds, esp opiates.  Tolerated tube feeds yesterday until
   stopped due to question of perf, now tolerating NGT to gravity
   - NGT in place, continue trial to gravity and consider removal later
   today or tomorrow if no further nausea
   - Hold TF while there is perforation
   - Antiemetics PRN
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, concern over benzo withdrawal. Patient was
   loaded with valium with little improvement. CIWA has been 0-1 for the
   last 24 hours and delirium improved.
    - Can dc CIWA scale today as no further evidence of withdrawal.
    - CTA without evidence of PE
   - Patient appears to be normovolemic, not complaining of any pain, no
   other obvious cause for sinus tachycardia
   - Per surgery request, patient started on IV lopressor q4H with holding
   parameters today, will continue to reevaluate and discontinue as able
   # Anemia: Hct stable over last several days.
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output- guaiac positive.  But hct stable
   - Continue to monitor Hct qday unless acute HD change
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement.
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   # Transaminitis
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect, current elevation may be due to cholestasis from TPN
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend, increased slightly over last
   few days
   # DVT: new LUE swelling, US negative for DVT.  Patient was previously
   maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter placed in the setting of
   emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Holding off on hep gtt given ? perf and guaiac positive stools
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters, also started on
   lopressor today as above.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent surgery for a GIST tumor resection and developed several complications. She had small bowel obstruction (SBO), required resection and colostomy, and subsequently went back to the operating room for surgical anastomosis. However, a leak was discovered, and attempts to close the abdomen failed. As a result, a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) was placed. The patient completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and was extubated but experienced post-extubation delirium, which has since resolved. She also had difficulty tolerating tube feeding (TF) and is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to suspected small bowel leak. The patient developed fever and leukocytosis, likely due to abdominal abscesses and the small bowel leak. She was started on empirical vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient has a history of GIST tumor, SBO, resection/colostomy, and open abdominal wound. She is currently in the ICU with various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel leak: The patient has a history of small bowel leak, which can lead to abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, and sepsis.
2. GIST tumor: The patient has a history of GIST tumor, which can recur or metastasize, leading to further complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). She experienced small bowel obstruction (SBO) post-surgery, leading to a second resection and colostomy. However, she developed an open abdominal wound that could not be closed due to a leak. Multiple attempts at closure failed, and a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) was placed. The patient completed a 10-day course of antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) for suspected intra-abdominal infection, which showed improvement in her condition.

On extubation, the patient experienced delirium but has now resolved. She has difficulty tolerating tube feeds (TF) and is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient presented with fever, likely originating from an abdominal source, as indicated by multiple small abscesses seen on abdominal CT. She was started on empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam).

The patient has a history of GIST and is scheduled to see an oncologist today. She also has leukocytosis and fever, potentially related to the abdominal abscesses or a central venous line (CVL). The CVL was removed, and a PICC line was placed instead. She continues to receive the same antibiotics.

The patient has experienced nausea and vomiting (N/V), which improved after clamping the nasogastric tube (NGT). Her bowel sounds are present, but she has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), for which she received an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter and is not receiving heparin at this time.

She is also experiencing sinus tachycardia, but the cause is unclear. Her blood pressure is elevated, and she is being treated with intravenous hydralazine and lopressor. The patient has anemia, possibly related to gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by guaiac-positive stools. However, her hematocrit (Hct) has been stable on recent checks. She also has hyperbilirubinemia, possibly due to cholestasis, especially considering the prolonged use of TPN.

The patient's respiratory status is stable post-extubation, and she does not require supplemental oxygen or show signs of respiratory distress. She is receiving prophylactic heparin and famotidine. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires close monitoring."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass (GIST tumor) who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
- The patient developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and was found to have a suspected small bowel leak on CT scan.
- Multiple abscesses were also detected in the abdomen, and the patient was started on empirical vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
- The patient's temperature is elevated at 100.6°F, and she has tachycardia with a heart rate of 125 bpm.
- The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a slight variation in the systolic blood pressure.
- The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is 99%.
- The patient's weight has decreased from 127 kg to 92.5 kg.
- Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,466 mL and output of 1,565 mL.
- The patient is receiving TPN with lipids and has been holding tube feeds due to the suspected small bowel leak.
- The patient has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, famotidine, hydralazine, and heparin sodium.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and chills.
- Physical examination reveals no acute distress, tachycardia, and symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds.
- The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present.
- There is evidence of lower extremity edema.
- Neurologic examination is not assessed.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- The patient has been diagnosed with bowel perforation, GIST, leukocytosis/fever, nausea/vomiting, DVT, sinus tachycardia, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypertension, and stress ulcers.
- The patient is currently on TPN with lipids and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bowel perforation: The patient has been diagnosed with bowel perforation, which is a serious condition where there is a hole or tear in the wall of the intestine. This can lead to infection, peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdomen), and sepsis.
2. GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor): The patient has a history of GIST tumor. Complications may arise if the tumor recurs or metastasizes.
3. Abscesses: The presence of multiple abscesses in the abdomen indicates an ongoing infection. If the abscesses do not respond to antibiotics or if they rupture, it can lead to further complications such as sepsis.
4. Small bowel leak: The suspected small bowel leak identified on CT scan can result in peritonitis, infection, and sepsis if not managed appropriately.
5. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an ongoing infection. If the infection spreads or becomes more severe, it can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
6. Nausea/vomiting: The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting may be due to bowel obstruction or medication side effects. If not managed effectively, it can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT, which is a potentially life-threatening condition if a blood clot travels to the lungs and causes a pulmonary embolism.
