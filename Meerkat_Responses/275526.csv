","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis, anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). He presented to Hospital 1 with a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) and was transferred for further care.

The patient has several potential medical complications:
1. Hematoma: The patient has a large hematoma on the right side of his chest from the scapula to the flank and down to the sacrum. This could be due to torn intercostal vessels, and there is a possibility of ongoing bleeding into the pelvis.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to the hematoma/trauma. Other possible causes include gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from varices, ulcers, diverticulosis, portal gastropathy, or chronic disease.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient presented with a creatinine level of 3.7 and is currently at 2.9. The cause of ARF is unclear, but it may be related to hypovolemia in the setting of bleeding or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
4. Fall: The patient appears to have had a fall, which seems mechanical in nature. Monitoring is ongoing, and a possible echo can be considered.
5. ESLD: The patient likely has ESLD due to alcoholic cirrhosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) secondary to ETOH (alcoholic) cirrhosis, anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). He presented with a HCT (hematocrit) drop and was transferred for further care.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hematoma: The patient has a large hematoma on the right side of the chest, from the scapula to the flank and down to the sacrum. This could lead to complications such as infection, bleeding, or pressure effects on surrounding structures.

2. Anemia: The patient is anemic, likely due to the hematoma/trauma, but other etiologies like gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from varices, ulcer, diverticulosis, portal gastropathy, or chronic disease should also be considered. The patient has received blood transfusions, which may help improve the anemia.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which could be due to hypovolemia in the setting of bleeding, but other possibilities include hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Monitoring of renal function and avoiding nephrotoxins is important.

4. ESLD: The patient likely has ESLD secondary to ETOH cirrhosis. This can lead to complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, and var"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ESLD due to ETOH cirrhosis, anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). He presented to Hospital1 with a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration and was transferred for further care. The patient has received 13 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to transfer. He has a large hematoma on the right side of his chest, extending from the scapula to the flank and down to the sacrum. The patient also has edema in his right leg, mild asterixis, hepatomegaly, and scleral icterus. His vital signs are stable, but he has an elevated lactate level of 5.1 K/uL and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematoma: The large hematoma on the patient's chest could lead to further bleeding or infection.
2. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level and may require additional blood transfusions to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. This could be due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), or other causes. Close monitoring of kidney function and avoidance of nephrotoxins are essential.
4. Cirrhosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with liver disease, who was transferred to the ICU from OSH due to a hematoma, acute blood loss anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has a history of pancytopenia and is suspected to have alcoholic cirrhosis. He received 15 units of blood transfusion over the past 6 days, but his hematocrit (Hct) levels are still not appropriate, indicating ongoing active bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Profound Anemia: The patient's anemia is most likely due to the hematoma and acute blood loss. Despite receiving blood transfusions, his Hct levels have not improved adequately, raising concerns for ongoing active bleeding. Serial abdominal exams and Hct monitoring will be performed, and interventional radiology (IR) intervention will be considered if bleeding continues.
2. Fall: The patient's fall appears to be mechanical in nature.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is attributed to alcohol use as per OSH workup. Lactulose will be continued to manage cirrhosis.
4. ARF: The patient's creatinine levels peaked at 3 and are now improving. Pre-renal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to blood loss and diuretics is suspected. Urine electrolytes are pending for further evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of liver disease, who was transferred to the ICU for acute blood loss anemia and renal failure. He has a large hematoma with ecchymoses extending over the entire right posterior lung field. The patient received 15 units of blood transfusion over the past six days, but his hematocrit (Hct) is still not up appropriately. The patient's fall appears to be mechanical in nature. The cirrhosis is attributed to alcohol use. The patient's creatinine level peaked at 3 and is now improving, suggesting pre-renal or acute tubular necrosis due to blood loss and diuretics. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Profound Anemia: The patient's ongoing bleeding and inadequate response to blood transfusion may lead to continued anemia and potential complications such as hypotension, organ dysfunction, and tissue hypoperfusion.
2. Fall: The mechanical fall could result in further injuries or complications, such as fractures or internal bleeding.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis, attributed to alcohol use, increases the risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. If not managed appropriately, this could progress to chronic renal failure, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of liver disease, who has been transferred to the ICU with acute blood loss anemia and renal failure. The patient's chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding, and he has received a total of 15 units of blood transfusion over the past six days. However, his hematocrit (Hct) levels are still not up appropriately.

The patient has pancytopenia, which means he has a low count of all blood cell types, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can be attributed to his history of alcoholic cirrhosis. He also has a large hematoma with ecchymoses extending over the entire right posterior lung field.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/60 mmHg to 130/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. His temperature is within normal range at 37.2 degrees Celsius.

The patient's lab results show a low white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.9 K/uL, low platelet count (Plt) of 101, elevated creatinine level (Cr) of 2.1, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) of 22/53. The patient's electrolytes are within"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with liver disease, who presented with acute blood loss anemia and renal failure. He has a history of pancytopenia and is currently being treated in the ICU. The patient's condition is critical, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Profound Anemia: The patient has a significant anemia likely due to blood loss from the hematoma. Despite receiving blood transfusions, his hematocrit levels have not improved, raising concerns for ongoing active bleeding. Serial abdominal exams and hematocrit monitoring will be performed, and interventional radiology (IR) intervention may be considered if bleeding continues.

2. Fall: The patient appears to have had a mechanical fall, but further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is attributed to alcohol use as per the workup at OSH. It is important to continue lactulose to manage this condition.

4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's creatinine levels peaked at 3 mg/dL and are now improving. The cause of acute renal failure is suspected to be pre-renal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to blood loss and the use of diuretics. Urine electrolyte levels are pending for further evaluation.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient's nutritional needs should be closely monitored and managed.

   - ascites seems stable, if worsens, consider paracentesis
   .
   #ARF-Pt presented with Cr 3.7, currently 2.9. Unclear of baseline.
   Likely [**2-10**] hypovolemia, has improved with volume resuccitation.  Did
   get pretreated before dye load.
   -trend Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxins.
   .
   #anasarca-likely secondary to extensive resuscitation with PRBCs and
   fluid. Also, likely that pt has hypoalbuminemia.
   -will continue to monitor, diuresis once HD stability ensured, no
   diuresis yet
   .
   #HTN-will hold off on home meds in setting of recent bleed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to ETOH (alcohol) cirrhosis, anemia, and ARF (acute renal failure). The patient presented to Hospital1 with a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) and was transferred for further care.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Anemia: The patient has received a total of 13 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), yet the hemoglobin concentration is still not rising appropriately. This suggests ongoing blood loss or impaired production of red blood cells. Possible causes of anemia include gastrointestinal bleeding from varices, ulcers, diverticulosis, portal gastropathy, or chronic disease.

2. Chest/axillary hematoma: The patient has a large subcutaneous/intramuscular hematoma in the right chest and flank area. This could be the cause of the anemia and should be monitored for any signs of expansion or worsening. Pain control with oxycodone is recommended.

3. Fall: The patient appears to have fallen, possibly due to mechanical factors. Monitoring on telemetry is advised, and consideration should be given to an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function, as well as a PT (prothrombin time) consult to investigate the cause of the bleeding.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with multiple health concerns. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events are documented in the note. 

From the medical history, it appears that the patient has a history of allergies to codeine and previous antibiotic use. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate between 76-94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/52-148/69 mmHg, respiratory rate between 8-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday and today, along with 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient also received mucomyst and NaHCO3 prior to a CT scan, which showed large right chest wall and flank hematoma, unchanged from 18 hours prior. There is no evidence of active IV contrast extravasation. The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with atelectasis, ascites, hypoattenuating lesions in the liver, cirrhosis with stigmata of portal hypertension, and a possible right posterior tenth rib fracture.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to alcohol cirrhosis, presenting with anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), and multiple other medical complications. The patient has received a significant amount of blood transfusions, which may lead to complications such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). 

The patient's large right chest wall and flank hematoma suggests potential bleeding complications, possibly related to coagulopathy secondary to liver disease or recent blood transfusions. This could result in continued bleeding, hypotension, and shock.

The presence of bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis indicates possible respiratory compromise due to fluid accumulation in the lungs.

The patient's ascites, hypoattenuating lesions in the liver, and cirrhosis with stigmata of portal hypertension suggest chronic liver disease and its associated complications.

The possible right posterior tenth rib fracture could be due to trauma or fall, and monitoring for further signs of injury is necessary.

Given the patient's multiple organ dysfunction, close monitoring and management of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values are crucial. Additionally, the patient's recent blood transfusions require careful evaluation for any potential transfusion reactions or complications.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise include continued bleeding, hypotension, shock, respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with ESLD secondary to alcohol abuse cirrhosis, presenting with HCT drop. He has received 13 units of PRBCs and 5 units of FFP prior to transfer. The patient's anemia is likely due to acute blood loss from trauma or gastrointestinal bleeding, as well as chronic disease. He is currently in the ICU and requires close monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of cirrhosis and alcohol abuse puts him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can cause significant blood loss and require further transfusion.
2. Hemolysis: The patient's low platelet count and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels may indicate hemolysis, which could be caused by transfusion reactions or other factors.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of ESLD, there is a risk for hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.
4. Respiratory complications: The large chest wall and flank hematoma may compromise respiratory function, leading to respiratory distress or failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's history of acute kidney injury (ARF) and elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. This can be exacerbated by hypovolemia from bleeding or other factors.
6. Infection: Immunosuppressed patients with ESLD are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with liver disease treated at OSH for a hematoma, acute blood loss anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). He has received 21 units of blood transfusion over the past week, but his hematocrit (Hct) has not increased appropriately, raising concerns for ongoing active bleeding with no clear source on computed tomography angiography (CTA) torso. The patient also has a history of ethanol cirrhosis and pancytopenia. He is currently on lactulose and has been holding further treatment in the setting of acute bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Profound Anemia due to acute blood loss - The patient's profound anemia is a result of acute blood loss from trauma and underlying coagulopathy from liver disease. This condition can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and weakness. If left untreated, it may lead to cardiac complications like heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF) - The patient's creatinine levels have peaked at 3 and are now improving with blood resuscitation. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's renal function and avoiding nephrotoxic agents to prevent further deterioration of kidney function.
3. Ethanol Cirrhosis - The patient's history of ethanol cirrhosis increases the risk of complications related to portal hypertension, such as variceal bleeding,"

   transferred with chest wall hematoma and continued bleeding in the
   context of mechanical trauma and coagulopathy. Over the past day, he
   has continued to have acute blood loss anemia, with an inappropriately
   low rise in his hematocrit following transfusion of 6 units blood.
   Acute renal failure is slightly better, but he remains at risk for
   further worsening due to contrast dye load received yesterday. CT torso
   without obvious active source. Given ongoing bleed, will obtain tagged
   scan to try to delineate source. Continue to trend hct

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with liver disease, including alcoholic cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU for a hematoma, acute blood loss anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). He has received 21 units of blood transfusion over the past week, but his hematocrit (Hct) has not increased appropriately, raising concerns about ongoing active bleeding with no clear source on the CT torso. The patient's ARF is improving with blood resuscitation. He is currently tolerating oral diet, has well-controlled blood sugar, and is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Profound Anemia: The patient's profound anemia due to acute blood loss is a concern, especially since his Hct is not rising appropriately despite receiving a significant amount of blood transfusion. This could indicate ongoing bleeding or inadequate transfusion response. The source of bleeding needs to be identified and managed promptly to prevent further blood loss and deterioration of the patient's condition.

2. EtOH Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which increases his risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome. Monitoring for these complications and providing appropriate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a large hematoma on the left chest wall near T9/T10. He received a blood transfusion but continued to experience bleeding, leading to further transfusions and an interventional radiology (IR) procedure to embolize the bleeding artery. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of a hematoma. His vital signs show tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and he is receiving supplemental oxygen with an SpO2 of 95%. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, and his heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. He has mild asterixis and hepatomegaly on physical examination. Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL and a hematocrit of 26.9%. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient has been receiving blood products and intravenous fluids, with a total intake of 3,862 mL and an output of 2,000 mL. He is not on respiratory support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding: The patient initially presented with bleeding that required multiple transfusions and an IR procedure. There is a possibility of ongoing bleeding or rebleeding, which could lead to further blood loss and exacerbate his anemia.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased"

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ESLD (liver disease) and ETOH cirrhosis, anemia, ARF (acute renal failure), and a large hematoma on the left chest wall near T9/T10. The patient presented to the hospital with a HCT drop and was transferred for further care. He has received a total of 13 units of PRBCs and 5 units of FFP (fresh frozen plasma). The patient underwent an IR procedure yesterday, which involved cauterizing the T9 intercostal artery. A tagged red cell scan was also performed, showing bleeding at the T9 site. The patient's HCT continues to be low, and he is being monitored closely. The patient has a history of chronic liver disease, including ascites and encephalopathy. He has outpatient hepatology management and will defer long-term management to that physician. The patient presented with acute renal failure, with a baseline creatinine level of 3.7, currently at 2.9. It is unclear if this is a new development or a baseline value. The patient received volume resuscitation and pretreatment before dye load. His kidney function has improved, but it is still being monitored. The patient has hypoalbuminemia, likely secondary to extensive resuscitation with PRBCs and fluid. He is also experiencing anasarca, which may be due to the extensive resuscitation and hypoalbum"

The patient underwent a nuclear medicine procedure at [time] for a Red Tag study. Following this, the patient received a unit of blood transfused at 6 AM. The hematocrit (Hct) levels were initially 26.3, but after transfusing 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), it increased to 29.7 and then decreased to 26.9. Another unit of PRBCs was transfused, resulting in an Hct level of 31.2.

A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) failed to localize the site of bleeding, so a tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan was performed, which localized the bleeding to the center of a large hematoma on the left chest wall near T9/T10.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ESLD (liver disease) secondary to ETOH (alcohol) cirrhosis, anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient presented to the hospital with a significant drop in hemoglobin (HCT) and has been transferred for further care. 

The patient has received a total of 18 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Despite this, the patient's hemoglobin levels continue to be low, indicating ongoing blood loss. The cause of the anemia is likely secondary to the large hematoma on the right chest/axillary area. 

The patient also has acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. The patient's renal function has improved with volume resuscitation, but it is unclear if this is a new onset or a worsening of pre-existing renal impairment. 

The patient's other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal coagulation profile. 

The patient's overall condition requires close monitoring, and appropriate measures need to be taken to manage the hematoma, anemia, renal failure, hypoalbuminemia, and hypertension. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and will be closely monitored for any changes in their condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with liver disease, including alcoholic cirrhosis and ascites, as well as coagulopathy and pancytopenia. He was transferred from the outside hospital (OSH) with a chest wall hematoma and acute blood loss anemia. The patient underwent embolization of the distal T9 intercostal vessel based on a tagged red blood cell scan. His hematocrit (Hct) level remains unchanged. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is alert and oriented. He is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Profound Anemia: The patient has acute blood loss anemia due to trauma and underlying coagulopathy from liver disease. Close monitoring of Hct levels is necessary, and further blood transfusions may be required.
2. EtOH Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis secondary to chronic alcohol use. Long-term management of this condition will involve outpatient follow-up with the OSH.
3. Basilar Crackles: The patient has basilar crackles on examination, which could be due to atelectasis or fluid accumulation. Incentive spirometry and chest physiotherapy should be continued to prevent further complications like pneumonia.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for signs of altered mental status or other symptoms is important.
