   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo female with history significant for HTN, DM, and dyslipidedemia
   who presenting with dyspnea and found to have ischemic cardiomyopathy
   (EF 20-25%) and chronic 2 vessel diffuse CAD.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p Cardiac Catheterization that shows LMCA 50% ostial
   lesions, LAD with mid subtotal occlusion. RCA has a mid vessel
   occlusion with collaterals from the LAD to the distal RCA. LCx with no
   significant dz. Patient with multivessel coronary diease.  No evidence
   of new ischemic event.
   - Continue ASA 325mg daily
   - D/C Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Hold Atorvastatin for now in light of LFT abnomalities, trend in AM,
   consider restarting.

   # PUMP:  Acute systolic heart failure.  NHYA Class II-III.  Patient
   with signs of left and right sided heart failure.  The patient had PCWP
   of 43 on Cath and had multivessel CAD.  Likely ischemic CM, with LVEF
   25-30%.  Patient maintaining MAP > 60, has rales on NRB, with slightly
   cool extemities.  As patient continues to maintain MAP > 60, plan to
   intermittantly bolus lasix.  If patient becomes hypotensive, will
   consider starting dobutamine gtt and place A-line and RIJ.  Last ABG
   7.40/35/190/22.  Patient's tachycardia may be a compensatory result and
   may decrease after patient is adequately diursed and back on starling
   curve.
   - Continue Lasix 40mg IV boluses prn, goal negative 1-2L overnight.
   - Hold BB, restarting ACE in AM (captopril 6.25, consider increase as
   tolerated)
   - wean as tolerated
   - Low Na diet, education
   .

   related to catecholaminergic response to being off starling curve.
   - Monitor on tele
   - diuresis as above.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes

   #  Transaminitis:  Unclear etiology.  AST 133; ALT 237.  Likely
   congestive hepatomegaly.
   - Trend in AM
   - f/u hepatitis serology
   - Hold statin for now.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. She presented with dyspnea and was found to have ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20-25%) and chronic two-vessel diffuse coronary artery disease.

The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization, which showed left main coronary artery (LMCA) 50% ostial lesions, left anterior descending (LAD) with mid-subtotal occlusion, right coronary artery (RCA) with mid-vessel occlusion and collaterals from the LAD to the distal RCA, and left circumflex (LCx) with no significant disease. The patient is diagnosed with multivessel coronary disease and no evidence of new ischemic event.

The patient's current condition in the ICU includes acute systolic heart failure with NYHA Class II-III symptoms, signs of left and right-sided heart failure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 43 on catheterization, multivessel CAD, and estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%. The patient is maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60, has rales on both lungs, and slightly cool extremities. The plan is to intermittently bolus Lasix if the patient maintains MAP > 60, and if the patient becomes hypotensive, consider starting dobutamine infusion and"

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. She presented with dyspnea and was found to have ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20-25%) and chronic 2-vessel diffuse coronary artery disease. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed LMCA 50% ostial lesions, LAD with mid-subtotal occlusion, RCA with mid-vessel occlusion, and LCx with no significant disease. She has multivessel coronary disease but no evidence of a new ischemic event.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute systolic heart failure (NYHA Class II-III), with signs of left and right-sided heart failure. Her left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated to be 25-30%. She has rales on both lungs, cool extremities, and an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 43 on catheterization. The patient is maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and is receiving intermittent boluses of Lasix. If she becomes hypotensive, dobutamine will be started, and an arterial line and right internal jugular catheter will be placed.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo female with history significant for HTN, DM, and dyslipidedemia
   who presenting with dyspnea and found to have ischemic cardiomyopathy
   (EF 20-25%) and chronic 2 vessel diffuse CAD.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p Cardiac Catheterization that shows LMCA 50% ostial
   lesions, LAD with mid subtotal occlusion. RCA has a mid vessel
   occlusion with collaterals from the LAD to the distal RCA. LCx with no
   significant dz. Patient with multivessel coronary diease.  No evidence
   of new ischemic event.
   - Continue ASA 325mg daily
   - D/C Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Hold Atorvastatin for now in light of LFT abnomalities, trend in AM,
   consider restarting if normal.
   - per CT surgery, not a candidate for CABG given poor targets for
   touchdown; as patient could not be intervened on in [**Last Name (LF) 11055**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require
   maximal medical therapy
   .
   # PUMP:  Acute systolic heart failure.  NHYA Class II-III.  Patient
   with signs of left and right sided heart failure.  The patient had PCWP
   of 43 on Cath and had multivessel CAD.  Likely ischemic CM, with LVEF
   25-30%.  Patient maintaining MAP > 60, has rales on NRB, with slightly
   cool extemities.  As patient continues to maintain MAP > 60, plan to
   intermittantly bolus lasix.  If patient becomes hypotensive, will
   consider starting dobutamine gtt and place A-line and RIJ.  Last ABG
   7.40/35/190/22.  Patient's tachycardia may be a compensatory result and
   may decrease after patient is adequately diursed and back on starling
   curve.
   - Continue Lasix 40mg IV boluses prn, goal negative 1-2L overnight.
   - on BB, ACEI; will titrate as BP/HR allow
   - patient may require ICD given EF 20-25%; unclear if patient has
   ischemic vs. nonischemic cardiomyopathy as global hypokinesis noted on
   echo.  If patient has nonischemic CM, per SCD-HEFT criteria would need
   to be NYHA Class II/III at baseline, on medical treatment, to be
   candidate for ICD placement.  If ischemic CM, given patient
s EF ICD is
   likely indicated.  Discuss with EP.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed LMCA 50% ostial lesions, LAD with mid-subtotal occlusion, RCA with mid-vessel occlusion with collaterals from the LAD to the distal RCA, and LCx with no significant disease. The patient has multivessel coronary disease. No evidence of new ischemic event was noted.

The patient's current medications include ASA 325 mg daily, metoprolol 12.5 TID (due to episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia), and furosemide (Lasix) for fluid overload. Plavix was stopped, and captopril 6.25 was increased to 12.5 mg. Atorvastatin was held due to liver function abnormalities.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 89 bpm (85-117 bpm), blood pressure of 107/65 mmHg (83-125/84 mmHg), respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute (8-38 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula,"
