","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple medical issues, including progressive aphasia, C-diff colitis, and recurrent urosepsis. He presented with fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, and volume depletion. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/58 to 175/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on aerosol-cool delivery device. The patient is arousable to voice but has intermittent tonic movements of the body. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the left base, crackles in the right lung, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, soft abdomen with no masses or rebound/guarding, and hyperreflexive, contracted extremities. The patient's chest X-ray shows no pneumonia or signs of congestive heart failure, but there is a poorly seen left upper lobe lung nodule and chronic left basilar atelectasis/effusion. The patient's goals of care have been discussed with the family, and they have agreed to comfort measures only. Antibiotics, beta blockers, and further lab studies have been discontinued. Palliative care consult has been placed, and the patient is to be hydrated along with tube feeds. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his communication contacts are listed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, respiratory distress, and crackles in the right lung suggest a possible pneumonia. Additionally, the chest X-ray shows a left upper lobe lung nodule, which could indicate an infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and decreased breath sounds at the left base indicate potential respiratory failure, especially considering his age and underlying medical conditions.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's blood pressure readings vary widely, indicating possible fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance is necessary to prevent complications associated with fluid overload.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and advanced age are risk factors for developing DVT. Prophylaxis has been initiated, but regular assessment for symptoms and signs of DVT should be performed.
5. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical condition and the use of invasive procedures increase the risk of stress ulcers. Prophylaxis for stress ulcer should continue to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's need for respiratory support, there is a risk of developing VAP. Adequate lung secretion clearance and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to prevent this complication.
7. Contractures: The patient's hyperreflexive, contracted extremities suggest the development of contractures. Regular range of motion exercises and proper positioning are necessary to prevent further contracture formation."

   lethargy, respiratory distress, volume depletion.
   #. Leukocytosis/fever: Patient meeting criteria for sepsis. possible
   source of infection in urine with + UA, C-diff in addition to meeting
   two SIRS criteria with temp and elevated WBC. Patient febrile and
   tachycardic on admission. Indwelling foley, hx of klebsiella and
   pseudomonas UTI, MRSA bacteremia, fungemia. Hx of C-diff with recurrent
   diarrhea.
   -follow up Blood cxs, urine cultures
   -Vanc/zosyn to empirically cover for UTI, potential pulmonary source
   -IV flagyl- potentially will not cover continued c-diff relapse but
   unable to use the G tube at this time. Once confirm use will give PO
   vanc and consider continuing IV flagyl.
   -consider discussion of changing patient foley but indwelling so after
   discussion with family and potentially urology
   -CXR in AM to assess for aspiration progression
   .
   Respiratory distress: unclear etiology and unable to obtain ABG. No
   eveidence of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of A-fib with RVR.
   Lactate elevated. Unlikely completely a compensatory response to a
   metabolic acidosis. Unclear whether aspiration. No hx of lung disease.
   Will continue to watch for ARDS in the setting of infection but stable
   on Fio2 35% face mask at this time.
   -ipratropium nebs
   -Face mask with supplemental O2
   -no BiPAP, no intubation per patient's and family's wishes
   -continue Vanc/zosyn (day 1 = [**5-25**]) empirically for aspiration pneumonia
   -NPO as patient is NPO at baseline and aspiration precautions
   -No ABG as per family
   -repeat CXR to assess for fluid overload.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: Patient
   presented with rates in 110s-150s. Pt is rate controlled as outpatient
   on diltiazem 90mg QID, and metoprolol 100mg TID. Patient did not
   receive BB and CCB for >24 hours. Also did not receive any hydration
   for >24 hours. Patient also with potential sepsis with fever. Overnight
   got IV metoprolol.  Given that G tube is functioning, would restart
   outpatient regiment of diltiazem and metoprolol via G tube.
   -continue bolus IV fluids as BP and HR tolerate
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Cr baseline is 0.9 to 1.1. Cr
   on admission is 1.9. Likely prerenal as patient was not taking any
   liquids po prior to admission.
   -continue IV fluids

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple medical issues, including progressive aphasia, C-diff colitis, and recurrent urosepsis. He presented with fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, and volume depletion. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/58 to 175/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, fever, and potential sources of infection including C-diff colitis, urinary tract infection, and possible pulmonary infection. He meets criteria for sepsis and requires aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Distress: The cause of the patient's respiratory distress is unclear. He is being supported with supplemental oxygen and aerosol-cool delivery device. There is no evidence of flash pulmonary edema, but further assessment is needed, including a chest X-ray to rule out aspiration pneumonia.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's heart rate is uncontrolled, despite being on diltiazem and metoprolol. He requires rate control, and restarting his outpatient regimen of diltiazem and metoprolol via G tube is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple medical issues, including progressive aphasia, C-diff colitis, and recurrent urosepsis. He presented with fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, and volume depletion. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, G-tube dysfunction, anemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension, and a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, with symptoms including fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Possible sources of infection include the urinary tract, C-diff colitis, and a pulmonary source.
2. Respiratory Distress: The cause of the patient's respiratory distress is unclear, and he is currently being supported with supplemental oxygen. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia, but further evaluation is needed.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were within normal range but have now increased to 1.9 on admission. This suggests acute kidney injury, which could be due to prerenal causes such as volume depletion.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a significant free water deficit and requires careful management to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple medical issues, including progressive aphasia, C-diff colitis, and recurrent urosepsis. He presents with fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, and volume depletion. The patient has a history of klebsiella and pseudomonas UTI, MRSA bacteremia, fungemia, and C-diff with recurrent diarrhea. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/58 mmHg to 175/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 35% via face mask and is being given aerosol-cool oxygen delivery. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels. Imaging reveals no pneumonia or evidence of congestive heart failure, but there is a chronic left basilar atelectasis/effusion and a poorly seen left upper lobe lung nodule.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis due to fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and potential sources of infection including urine with positive urine analysis, C-diff colitis, and indwelling Foley catheter.
2. Respiratory Distress: The etiology of the respiratory distress is unclear, and there is a concern for aspiration. The patient's oxygen saturation is stable on supplemental oxygen, but ongoing monitoring is required.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated from 0.9-1.1 to 1.9, suggesting prerenal azotemia due to volume depletion.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a free water deficit on admission and received normal saline in the emergency department. He received D5W overnight, but his sodium level needs to be monitored.
5. G-tube Dysfunction: Initially, there were concerns about the placement of the G-tube, but a subsequent study confirmed its correct placement.
6. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's heart rate is controlled with metoprolol, but restarting outpatient medications through the G-tube is recommended.
7. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, and his current creatinine level indicates worsening renal function.
8. Anemia: The patient is hemoconcentrated, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of anemia.
9. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and restarting home medications for rate control is advised.
10. Foley Catheter: The chronic use of a Foley catheter may lead to urinary tract infections, and consideration should be given to changing it.
11. Glaucoma: The patient has glaucoma, and his eye medications should be continued.

The patient's medical condition is complex, and close monitoring and management of these potential complications are necessary."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with a chief complaint of fever and respiratory distress. The patient is currently on a morphine drip at 10mg/hour, indicating the presence of severe pain or discomfort. The patient's heart rate is high, reaching up to 190s at times, and oxygen saturation levels are in the 70s, indicating poor oxygenation. The patient has allergies to no known drugs.

The patient has received various antibiotics since admission, including Vancomycin on 05/25/10 at 10:30 PM, Metronidazole and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 05/26/10 at 04:26 AM. The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate infusion at 10 mg/hour.

In the ICU, the patient is being administered lorazepam (Ativan) and morphine sulfate. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms.

Flowsheet data indicates a maximum temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), with a current temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F). The patient's blood pressure is 118/53 mmHg (67/100 mmHg) with a range of 105-87 mmHg. The respiratory rate is 27 breaths per minute. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF), and the SpO2 level is 74%.

The patient has received a total of 682 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 435 mL of urine and 240 mL of TF. The patient's blood products and NG output are noted, but specific amounts are not mentioned. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through none, and the ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings are incomplete, as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments were not performed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (13.3 K/uL), low hemoglobin level (8.3 g/dL), normal glucose level (118 mg/dL), and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and plan include severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's code status is comfort measures only.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of further organ dysfunction, potential progression to septic shock, and possible deterioration of skin integrity. Additionally, the patient's hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation may require further management and monitoring."

His current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate ranging from 112-161 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/50-118/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 74%. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a history of morphine use. His physical examination shows course crackles bilaterally on anterior exam, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and 1+ left lower extremity edema. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows blossomed left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's family has agreed to comfort measures only, and goals include continued hydration and tube feeds, discontinuation of antibiotics and beta-blocker, no further lab studies, and palliative care consultation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. The presence of course crackles bilaterally suggests a possible worsening of his pneumonia.
