   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 y/o female with advanced CKD and ostomy, admitted
   with marked anion gap academia in setting of increased ostomy output
   and some worsening of renal failure..
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC (GAP): delta delta initially favoring slight
   mixed gap-nongap component, no osmolar gap.  Lactate normal.  Likely
   related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy output .
   Does have a significantly low baseline (mid teens) likely related to
   CKD and possibly RTA.
   -          Continue to evaluate for infectious etiology for diarrhea,
   check c. diff and stool cx
   -          With improvement in ABG, will d/c bicarb fluids.
   -          Continue to follow anion gap and lytes.
   -          Check urine lytes for urinary gap.
   -          Management of ARF below.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE V.
   Worsened 3.0
 3.9 without appreciable drop in urine output according
   to the patient and husband.  Now with mild improvement.
   -          Renal to see today; will discuss initiation of HD timing
   -          Needs HD access; likely tunneled line; has seen transplant
   as outpatient for access options.
   INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT
   -          consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics, elevated
   WBC
   -          Continue IV flagyl for now
   -          Check stool culture and c.diff.
   DYSPNEA.  Mostly exertional; likely related to acidemia and need for
   significant respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.  Lungs
   clear on exam and imaging; oxygenating well.
   -          Treatment of acidosis as above
   -          Monitor oxygenation with getting fluids overnight.
   -          Patient at risk for tiring
 hypoventilation; will watch in
   unit today.
   CONFUSION/altered MENTAL STATUS. Seems to be approaching baseline
   today.
   -          likely metabolic component or medication;  holding ditropan,
   tigan
   CELLULITIS, unclear if this is a new finding of infection or related to
   venous stasis.  Being managed by derm as outpatient for venous stasis.
   Appears that upper thigh erythema may be ?new.
   -          Received 1000mg IV Vancomycin in the ED, consider continuing
   q48h. consider vanco level in AM if continuing.
   -          Continue topical antifungal powder
   -          Bilat LE ultrasounds to r/o collections.
   MACROCYTOSIS.  Ongoing x years.  Unclear source but does have history
   of B12 deficiency, getting monthly IM replacement.
   -          recheck folate and B12; thyroid studies, as has history of
   significantly abnormal TSH levels in the past (most recently WNL).
   -          Will check into prior workup for this.
   HYPERTENSION. Normotensive currently
   -          Holding CCBs with peripheral edema; will monitor today and
   possible restart.
   CAD
   -          Continue aspirin daily
   GERD
   -          continue protonix 40mg IV BID (on at home); can change to PO
   when ostomy output improves.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient has worsening renal function and increased ostomy output. The patient's dyspnea is likely related to acidemia and the need for respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis. The patient also has confusion, cellulitis, macrocytosis, hypertension, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), GERD, and CAD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function indicates a potential complication of acute on chronic renal failure. This requires close monitoring and consideration for dialysis.

2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and symptoms such as diarrhea, cellulitis, and confusion may suggest an underlying infection. It is important to evaluate for infectious etiology and manage accordingly.

3. C. difficile enteritis: Given the patient's recent antibiotic use and increased ostomy output, there is a concern for C. difficile enteritis. Stool cultures and c. diff testing should be performed, and appropriate treatment initiated if positive.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, but there is a history of hypertension. Monitoring and management of blood pressure should continue, especially if symptoms of low blood pressure occur.

5. Macrocytosis: The patient's macrocytic anemia may require"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 y/o female with advanced CKD and ostomy, admitted
   with marked anion gap academia in setting of increased ostomy output.
   She remains with a metabolic acidosis with normal delta delta gap and
   no osmolar gap, no osmolar gap. This is more consistent with acute
   renal failure/uremia and ketosis (lactate wnl) rather than diarrhea or
   renal failure which more commonly produce a non-gap acidosis, though
   there may be a component of worsening renal failure or RTA that is
   contributing to the metabolic acidosis. Her ARF on top of CKD-V likely
   from volume depletion given increased ostomy output while on
   furosemide. She additionally could have developed a cellulitis in an
   area of skin breakdown on her lower extremities.
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC (GAP): normal delta delta, no osmolar gap.
   Lactate normal.  Likely related to worsening of renal failure and
   increased ostomy output (though would expect nongap component).  Does
   have a significantly low baseline (mid teens) likely related to CKD.
   -          Continue to evaluate for infectious etiology for diarrhea,
   check c. diff and stool cx
   -          Continue bicarb infusion (3 amps) at 150cc hour
   -          Continue to follow anion gap
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE V.
   Worsened 3.0
 3.9 without appreciable drop in urine output according
   to the patient and husband.  Now with mild improvement.
   -          Renal aware, notified in the ED, recommended continuing
   HCO3^- gtt tonight
   -          Needs HD access; consider tunneled line vs temp access
   INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT
   -          consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics, elevated
   WBC
   -          Received flagyl in the ED. If toxin positive, continue
   medication, consider PO vanco given ICU level of care
   -          Check stool culture
   CONFUSION/altered MENTAL STATUS
   -          likely metabolic components, but could be medications as
   well with worsening kidney function. Held ditropan, tigan
   -          Reassess in am
   CELLULITIS, difficult to tell at first meeting if this is a new finding
   of infection or related to venous stasis
   -          Received 1000mg IV Vancomycin in the ED, consider continuing
   q48h
   -          Continue topical antifungal powder
   HYPERTENSION
   -          Continue home medications likely, but normotensive tonight
   so will hold cardizem/lopressor this afternoon

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap metabolic acidosis in the setting of increased ostomy output. The patient remains with a metabolic acidosis with normal delta delta gap and no osmolar gap, which is more consistent with acute renal failure/uremia and ketosis (normal lactate levels) rather than diarrhea or other causes of non-gap acidosis.

The patient's acute renal failure on top of CKD-V likely resulted from volume depletion given the increased ostomy output while on furosemide. Additionally, she could have developed cellulitis in an area of skin breakdown on her lower extremities.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infectious etiology for diarrhea: The patient should be evaluated for infectious causes, and stool cultures and C. difficile tests should be continued.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, and it is important to continue monitoring kidney function and providing appropriate renal support.

3. Increased ostomy output: The increased ostomy output may be due to various reasons, including c. difficile enteritis given recent antibiotics and elevated WBC count. Stool cultures should be checked, and medication such as Flagyl should be continued if toxin positive. PO vancomycin may also be considered.

4. Confusion/altered mental status: The patient's confusion could be related"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who has undergone a colectomy. She is experiencing increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and has a metabolic acidosis due to acute-on-chronic renal failure. Her respiratory efforts are compensating for the acidosis. The patient also has leukocytosis with an unclear source, increased ostomy output, and potential cellulitis on her thighs. She has a history of hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She is currently on multiple medications including heparin for DVT prophylaxis, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and antibiotics for suspected Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute-on-chronic renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function can lead to further fluid and electrolyte imbalances, metabolic acidosis, and increased risk of complications such as hyperkalemia, pericarditis, and uremic encephalopathy.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base balance is disrupted due to the renal failure. This can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection. If left untreated, it"

The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who underwent a colectomy. She presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and increasing respiratory efforts. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 146/61 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has exophthalmos, macroglossia, and bilateral crackles in the lungs. She also has a distended abdomen with an ostomy bag producing green output and non-tender erythema and pink/red plaques on her medial thighs. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid levels. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient's primary concern is respiratory distress due to metabolic acidosis, which is acute on chronic renal failure. There is also a non-gap component suggesting a possible renal tubular acidosis (RTA).
   - Continue bicarbonate administration for now.
   - Repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) due to concern for progression of respiratory acidosis and increased work of breathing.
   - Consider BiPAP if needed.
   - Follow up with renal team regarding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 CKD, UC, and a history of colectomy. She presents with increasing shortness of breath, metabolic acidosis, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing crackles in her bilateral lung bases and has an elevated white blood cell count. Her labs show anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to high stool output. She has been receiving prophylactic antibiotics and has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, thyroid disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient is currently NPO due to her renal diet and is receiving various medications including heparin for DVT prophylaxis, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and Flagyl for possible Clostridium difficile infection. She is also on BiPAP for OSA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's crackles in the bilateral lung bases and the need for respiratory support indicate a higher risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with high anion gap metabolic acidosis. This condition can progress to more severe renal failure if not properly managed.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and the presence of leukocytosis suggest an underlying infection. The patient is already on empirical antibiotic therapy, but"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and a history of colectomy. She is experiencing increasing shortness of breath (SOB) in the setting of metabolic acidosis, likely due to acute-on-chronic renal failure and increased illeostomy output. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/63 to 160/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight and a plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of her lungs bilaterally, distended abdomen with green output from the ostomy, and peripheral pulses present but not assessed in the distal extremities. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.3 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 3.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 40 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 4.1 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 135 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 103 mEq/L, glucose of 73 mg/dL, and pH of 7."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) in the setting of metabolic acidosis. The patient's respiratory efforts are compensating for her mixed metabolic acidosis, which is acute on chronic renal failure. There is a non-gap component (increased delta-delta) with + UAG likely indicative of an RTA (although stool losses have added). The patient has markedly improved over the last 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped to 22 from 30 on admission, indicating a decrease in red blood cell count. This could be due to ongoing blood loss through occult stools and dilutional effects. The goal Hct should be maintained above 21. EPO therapy should be restarted, and hemolysis labs and reticulocyte count should be checked.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has increased ostomy output and a high clinical suspicion for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Initial tests were negative for C. diff, but treatment with ciprofloxacin should be continued empirically. The patient will also be treated for a probable urinary tract infection (UTI) with ciprofloxacin. Additionally, there is a possibility of skin cellulitis on the thigh, which is improving with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 CKD, UC, who underwent colectomy and is currently experiencing increasing shortness of breath (SOB) in the setting of metabolic acidosis. The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, high AG metabolic acidosis with adequate respiratory compensation, and increased illeostomy output leading to respiratory efforts.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a high AG metabolic acidosis with adequate respiratory compensation. This condition may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory distress and organ dysfunction.

2. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped from 30 on admission to 22, indicating a significant decrease in red blood cell count. This could be due to chronic kidney disease or occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Appropriate management is necessary to prevent further complications related to anemia.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient presents with leukocytosis and increased ostomy output, raising suspicion for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) or other infection. Empirical antibiotic treatment has been started, and urine culture is pending. If the infection is not appropriately managed, it may lead to sepsis or worsening of the patient's condition.

4. Skin Cellulitis: The patient has an improved skin cellulitis on the thigh, which was initially suspected but showed no evidence of abscess on ultrasound. It"

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who has undergone a colectomy and is experiencing increasing shortness of breath (SOB) in the setting of metabolic acidosis. She has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a high anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis that is compensated by respiratory efforts. The patient also has an increased illeostomy output, leading to respiratory efforts to compensate for her mixed metabolic acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's increasing work of breathing and the need for BiPAP suggest a risk of respiratory failure due to the progression of respiratory acidosis.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and increased ostomy output, which may indicate an infection. Empiric coverage for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is being continued pending results, and other blood cultures are pending.
3. Skin cellulitis: The patient has reddened areas on her inner thighs, which may develop into abscesses. An ultrasound of the thighs is planned to assess this further.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobilization and risk factors, there is a potential for DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.

   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 y/o female with advanced CKD and ostomy, admitted
   with marked anion gap academia in setting of increased ostomy output
   and some worsening of renal failure..
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC (GAP): delta delta initially favoring slight
   mixed gap-nongap component, no osmolar gap.  Lactate normal.  Likely
   related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy output .
   Does have a significantly low baseline (mid teens) likely related to
   CKD and possibly RTA.  Urine lytes and gap c/w RTA.

   to the patient and husband.  Now with improvement to 3.3.
   -          Awaiting renal's decision re: initiation of HD timing
   -          If HD this admit will need access; likely tunneled line; has
   seen transplant as outpatient for access options.
   INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT
   -          consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics, elevated
   WBC which responded with flagyl initiation, though would be rare to
   have enteritis without colon.
   -          Continue IV flagyl for now
   -          Check stool culture and c.diff (2nd today).
   ANEMIA.  Dropping steadily since admit; hct 22 today (30 at admit).  No
   obvious bleeding source or hematoma.  Baseline B12 deficiency
   (repleted), MDS, CKD.
   -         check hemolysis panel today (?history of this in the past per
   notes from several years ago)
   -         T&S, would not transfuse unless <21
   -         Consider restart of epo - both MDS and significant CKD.
   -         Guaiac ostomy output.
   DYSPNEA.  Mostly exertional; likely related to acidemia and need for
   significant respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.  Lungs
   clear on exam and imaging; oxygenating well.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap metabolic acidosis in the setting of increased ostomy output and worsening renal failure. The patient has several medical complications, including acute on chronic renal failure, chronic kidney disease stage V, increased ostomy output, anemia, dyspnea, and cellulitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by the increase in creatinine levels from 3.0 to 3.3. This could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
2. Chronic kidney disease stage V: The patient's CKD is at stage V, which means the kidneys are severely damaged and may not function properly. This can result in electrolyte imbalances and fluid retention.
3. Increased ostomy output: The patient's ostomy output has increased, which could indicate infection or other issues related to the ostomy. This needs to be monitored and managed to prevent complications such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are dropping steadily since admission, indicating anemia. This could be due to various causes, including chronic disease, blood loss, or bone marrow problems. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
5. Dyspnea: The patient experiences exertional dyspnea,"
