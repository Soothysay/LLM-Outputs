   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 832**] is a 52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA
   readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP overnight.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9. Last
   transfused on [**10-24**] 1u PRBC. Hypotension unlikely to be secondary to
   blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely representing
   contamination.  He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, so
   sepsis is unlikely.  Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC.
   - Continue stress dose steroids.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - On vanco and pip/tazo, which can be held as positive blood cultures
   likely present contamination.  Will restart if patient develops signs
   or symptoms of infection.
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   .
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of
   dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u oncology recs
   .
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   .
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC as above
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   .
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - cont oxybutinin
   - cont urojet
   .
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   .
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and
   decadron.
   .
   # H/O DVT/PE: Not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, radiation cystitis, and hypotension. He has been readmitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a history of intermittent hypotension attributed to blood loss during his previous admission. His hematocrit level is currently at 24.9%. The patient's blood cultures from October 24th are positive for coag-negative staph, but this is likely contamination. He has not shown signs of sepsis. The patient's cancer has been refractory to all therapies and has metastasized to the bone and liver. He also has leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which are likely secondary to bony metastatic prostate cancer. The patient's radiation cystitis has improved after a urologic procedure with formalin. His liver function tests are elevated, likely due to liver metastases. The patient continues to receive treatment for OSA, chronic pain, depression, pressure ulcer, and electrolyte imbalances. He has an IVC filter in place and is not a candidate for anticoagulation. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently on ICU level of care."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. He has a history of intermittent hypotension attributed to blood loss during his last admission. The patient's current blood pressure is stable, but the etiology of hypotension remains uncertain. Differential diagnoses include hypovolemia from blood loss, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient's hematocrit this morning is 24.9, and he was last transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) on 10/24. 

The patient has coag-negative staph positive blood cultures from 10/24, but this is likely contamination as he has not shown signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea). A cosyntropic stimulation test shows an increase in cortisol levels, suggesting that adrenal insufficiency is unlikely. 

The patient's metastatic prostate cancer has been refractory to all therapies, with metastasis to the bone and liver lesions concerning for further metastasis. His pain regimen will be reintroduced, including dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, and ativan.

The patient also has leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which are likely secondary to bony metastatic prostate cancer. Transfusion goals are to maintain a"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 832**] is a 52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA
   readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP overnight.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9. Last
   transfused on [**10-24**] 1u PRBC. Hypotension unlikely to be secondary to
   blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely representing
   contamination.  He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic,
   oso sepsis is unlikely.  Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC.
   - Taper stress dose steroids
   - Follow-up cultures
   - On antibiotics --> vanco and pip/tazo, which can be held as positive
   blood cultures likely present contamination.
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   .
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of
   dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   .
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding, however worsened over the past 24hours
   concerning for worsening in the setting of bacteremia.  Diff added on
   to ensure not neutropenic, but still pending at this time.
   - f/u diff; calculate ANC
   .
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer.
   - transfuse to hct goal > 25
   - transfuse plts goal > 20
   - will continue to monitor
   .
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - continue to monitor hct as above, but again, hematuria markedly
   improved from previously.
   - cont oxybutinin
   - cont urojet
   .
   # Elevated liver function tests: likely due to liver mets.
   - repeat LFTs
   - cont lactulose
   .
   # OSA: Continue cpap at night.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and
   decadron.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, radiation cystitis, and hypotension. He was readmitted to the ICU for the hypotension, which is currently stable but of uncertain etiology. The patient has a history of intermittent hypotension attributed to blood loss during his last admission. He is being monitored for signs of hypovolemia, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. His hematocrit level is at 24.9, and he received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Blood cultures are positive for coag-negative staph, but this is likely contamination as the patient has not shown any signs of infection. The patient's cancer has been refractory to all therapies and has metastasized to the bone and liver. He will be reintroduced to his home pain regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is currently stable, but the underlying cause is uncertain. It could be due to hypovolemia from blood loss, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. Close monitoring of blood pressure, urine output, mental status, and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Infection: Although the blood cultures are positive for coag-negative staph, they are likely contaminated, and the patient does not show signs of infection. However, continued monitoring and follow-up cultures are needed to ensure there is no genuine bacterial infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with metastatic prostate CA, recently in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with hypovolemic
   shock related to significant GU bleeding from radiation cystitis; now
   he returns with hypotension to SBP of 70s.  During episode of
   hypotension, he was mentating well and showed no signs of
   hypoperfusion.  Simultaneously he developed positive blood cultures
   with GPCs and presumed to have septic shock.  He received a 2.5L bolus
   with improvement of his blood pressure and upon transfer initially he
   has SBP in 100-110.  However, during his course he has had two episodes
   of brief SBP to 80's and has had another 1.5L fluid resucitation.  An
   arterial line was placed for continued hemodynamic monitoring.

   adrenal insufficiency.
   1.        ID: Sepsis with GP bacteremia from line infection.
   Leukopenic. Currently on vancomycin and zosyn until can confirm blood
   culture data.  Lactate is normal, no large anion gap.  Has preserved
   urine output without signs of hypoperfusion.  Mentation is clear.
   Currently has PICC line.
   -          Continue Vancomycin; f/u culture data.
   -          new right IJ line.
   2.       Endocrine:  On dexamethasone chronically for pain control.
   -          Will place on stress dose steroids in the short term:
   hydrocortisone 50mg q8h, then can taper once stable.
   -          Follow-up cortisol stimulation test
   3.       Thrombocytopenia:  Possibly related to DIC, also related to
   production problem in setting of bony mets.
   4.       Anemia:  He has chronic anemia, related to his malignancy.  No
   signs of active bleeding.
             - Suspect dilutional and also chronic decreased production.
   being transfused.
   5.      Elevated liver enzymes - likely due to mets

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP overnight.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9. Last
   transfused on [**10-24**] 1u PRBC. Hypotension unlikely to be secondary to
   blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely representing
   contamination.  He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, so
   sepsis is unlikely.  Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC.
   - Continue stress dose steroids.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - On vanco and pip/tazo, which can be held as positive blood cultures
   likely present contamination.  Will restart if patient develops signs
   or symptoms of infection.
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of
   dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u oncology recs
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC as above
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - cont oxybutinin
   - cont urojet
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and
   decadron.
   # H/O DVT/PE: Not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].
   # Depression: Continue celexa.
   # Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing.
   # FEN:  Regular, replete lytes prn.
   # Access : IJ, arterial line
   # PPx: SCDs, PPI.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. He has a history of intermittent hypotension during his previous admission, which was attributed to blood loss. However, his current hypotension is unlikely to be secondary to blood loss given the slow trend in hematocrit levels. The patient has blood cultures from October 24th positive for coag-negative staph, but the most recent sample is likely contaminated. He has not shown signs of infection such as fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea, making sepsis unlikely.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/49 to 126/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His physical examination reveals scleral icterus, a clear ocular movement, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with an early systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border, clear lung fields, soft distended abdomen with positive bowel sounds, and 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. He is wearing pneumatic compression boots.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 22,000/mm³, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), increased total bilirubin, and abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine and blood urea nitrogen). His electrolytes are within normal limits, and his glucose level is elevated.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including metastatic prostate cancer, hypotension, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, radiation cystitis, elevated liver function tests, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, depression, and pressure ulcer. He is currently on several medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cosyntropin, steroids, methadone, oxybutynin, pyridium, neurontin, and ativan.

The patient's plan includes transfusing 1 unit of packed red blood cells, continuing stress dose steroids, and following up with cultures. He will continue on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, which can be held if the blood cultures are confirmed to be contaminated. His MAP, UOP, mentation, and fluid balance will be monitored, and he will be bolused as necessary. The patient's pain regimen will be reintroduced, and he will be trended for oncology recommendations."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP x48 hours.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9;
   transfused 2 units since readmission to ICU. Hypotension unlikely to be
   secondary to blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures
   from [**10-24**] positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely
   representing contamination.  Has not been febrile, tachycardic, or
   tachypneic, so sepsis is unlikely. Cosyntropic stimulation test
   0.3->2.8.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, who was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. The patient's condition is complex and includes multiple medical complications. He has been intermittently hypotensive, possibly due to blood loss, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. His hematocrit level is low, indicating anemia, and he has received blood transfusions. The patient also has leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, radiation cystitis, elevated liver function tests, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, a history of DVT/PE with an IVC filter, depression, and a pressure ulcer. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his mental status is altered. He has been on various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, steroids, pain medications, lactulose, and others. The patient's blood cultures show no growth, and his catheter tip culture also shows no growth. His urine culture indicates a yeast infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia from blood loss, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management are necessary.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy or pain medications. It is important to monitor his mental status regularly and adjust medication dos"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP overnight.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9. Last
   transfused on [**10-24**] 1u PRBC. Hypotension unlikely to be secondary to
   blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely representing
   contamination.  He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, so
   sepsis is unlikely.  Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC.
   - Continue stress dose steroids.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - On vanco and pip/tazo, which can be held as positive blood cultures
   likely present contamination.  Will restart if patient develops signs
   or symptoms of infection.
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of
   dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u oncology recs
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC as above
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - cont oxybutinin
   - cont urojet
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and
   decadron.
   # H/O DVT/PE: Not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].
   # Depression: Continue celexa.
   # Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing.
   # FEN:  Regular, replete lytes prn.
   # Access : IJ, arterial line
   # PPx: SCDs, PPI.
   # Code:  Full, confirmed with his oncologist
   # Dispo:  Called out - awaiting bed

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer readmitted to the ICU for hypotension.
- The patient's blood cultures from 10/24 showed coag-negative staph, but this is likely contamination as the patient has not shown signs of infection.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/49 to 126/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient has been lethargic during the day.
- The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hematocrit of 28.7%, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.7 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 22.
- The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating potential liver metastases.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but there are slight variations in potassium and phosphate levels.
- The patient has a history of metastatic prostate cancer, radiation cystitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, depression, and pressure ulcers.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he is awaiting a bed for discharge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to various reasons such as hypovolemia from blood loss, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. Continuous monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
2. Infection: Although the blood cultures from 10/24 were positive for coag-negative staph, it is likely contamination. However, it is important to monitor for any signs or symptoms of infection, and follow-up cultures should be done.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to bone metastases or blood loss. Transfusion of packed red blood cells may be required to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could also be attributed to bone metastases. Close monitoring of platelet count is necessary, and transfusion may be needed to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Liver Metastases: The elevated liver function tests indicate possible liver metastases. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and imaging studies may be required to assess disease progression.
6. Pressure Ulcer: The patient has a stage II pressure ulcer that requires ongoing wound care management to prevent further deterioration.
7. Chronic Pain: The patient's chronic pain needs to be managed appropriately to ensure comfort and quality of life. Adjustments in the pain regimen may be necessary based on the patient's response.

   cystitis, admitted with question of CNS bacteremia which was more
   likely a contaminant with only 1/4 bottles positive. He continues to be
   hemodynamically more stable not requiring pressors.  Shock was possibly
   due to adrenal insufficiency.
   1.        Shock/ ID: question of CNS sepsis from line. Off vanco 24 hrs
   with no recurrence.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, who was recently admitted to the hospital with hypovolemic shock related to significant GU bleeding from radiation cystitis. He presented with hypotension, but maintained good mental status and showed no signs of hypoperfusion. The patient developed positive blood cultures with gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and was presumed to have septic shock, although only one of four bottles grew CNS. He received a 2.5L bolus with improvement in his blood pressure, and during his course, he had two episodes of brief SBP in the 80s and received another 1.5L fluid resuscitation.

The patient's allergies include ciprofloxacin and latex, and he has been off antibiotics since October 26th, 05:00 AM, and October 27th, 08:32 AM. He is currently being infused with vancomycin 1000mg q12h, as well as other medications such as Megace, Folic Acid, PPI, CBI, Methadone (held), Colace, Gabapentin, Vitamin D, Celexa, Ditropan, and Belladonna opium.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP x72 hours. During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 29.1;
   transfused 2 units since readmission to ICU. Hypotension unlikely to be
   secondary to blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures
   from [**10-24**] positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely
   representing contamination.  Has not been febrile, tachycardic, or
   tachypneic, so sepsis is unlikely. Concern is that patient is
   leukopenic at 1.4. Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Taper steroid dose
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Antibiotics discontinued on [**2170-10-27**]
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
   LFTs continue to rise. Also may be secondary to pain medications. Waxes
   and wanes with no set time course.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold pain meds for lethargy/confusion
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets.
   - F/u oncology recs
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding, likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer. Stable overnight after given 1U pRBCs
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   - Given that hematocrit stable for 36 hours, will check only once daily
   now.
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - Cont oxybutinin
   - Cont urojet
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and
   decadron.
   # H/O DVT/PE: Not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].
   # Depression: Continue celexa.
   - Consider getting psychiatry or SW involved given that patient seems
   severely depressed.
   # Pressure Ulcer: Stage II left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing.
   # FEN:  Regular, replete lytes prn.
   # Access : IJ, arterial line
   - D/c arterial line before transfer to floor.
   # PPx: SCDs, PPI.
   # Code:  Full, confirmed with his oncologist

","The patient is a 52-year-old gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. He has a history of intermittent hypotension attributed to blood loss during his previous admission. The etiology of his current hypotension is uncertain, but possible causes include hypovolemia from blood loss, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's hematocrit this morning is at 29.1, and he has received 2 units of blood transfusions since readmission to the ICU. Hypotension is unlikely to be secondary to blood loss given the slow trend in hematocrit. He has blood cultures from 10/24 positive for coag-negative staph, but 1/12 likely represents contamination. He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, so sepsis is unlikely. His leukocyte count is low at 1.4.

The patient's liver function tests continue to rise, suggesting ongoing liver damage. His coagulation profile shows elevated PT and PTT, indicating impaired blood clotting ability. He also has abnormal electrolyte levels, including low calcium and magnesium.

The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. He may also be experiencing pain medication-induced confusion. His pain is adequately controlled with current medications.

The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to bony metastases"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. He has a history of intermittent hypotension attributed to blood loss during his last admission. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 109/49 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient has been transfused with 2 units of blood since readmission. His hematocrit level is 29.1, indicating ongoing blood loss or anemia. Blood cultures from October 24th showed growth of coag-negative staph, but the most recent cultures are negative. Urine culture revealed yeast. 

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, as evidenced by rising liver function tests. Other medical conditions include metastatic prostate cancer, leukopenia, anemia/thrombocytopenia, radiation cystitis, elevated liver function tests, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, history of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, depression, pressure ulcer, and Foley catheter.

Plan:

1. Discontinue arterial line.
2. Taper steroid dose.
3. Follow-up cultures.
4. Antibiotics discontinued on October 27th.
5. Monitor mean arterial pressure (MAP), urine output, mentation, and"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. The patient has been intermittently hypotensive during his previous admission to the same hospital unit, attributed to blood loss. However, the current hypotension is unlikely to be secondary to blood loss since the hematocrit trend has been slow. The patient also has blood cultures positive for coag-negative staph, but one sample is likely representing contamination. There are no signs of sepsis such as fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea. The patient's cosyntropin stimulation test showed an increase in cortisol levels, indicating adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, the steroid dose should be tapered.

The patient also has altered mental status, likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. The liver function tests continue to rise, and this condition may also be caused by pain medications. Lactulose should be continued, and pain medications should be withheld for lethargy/confusion.

Other medical conditions include metastatic prostate cancer, leukopenia, anemia/thrombocytopenia, radiation cystitis, elevated liver function tests, OSA, chronic pain, H/O DVT/PE, depression, pressure ulcer, and FEN.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP x72 hours. During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9;
   transfused 2 units since readmission to ICU. Hypotension unlikely to be
   secondary to blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures
   from [**10-24**] positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely
   representing contamination.  Has not been febrile, tachycardic, or
   tachypneic, so sepsis is unlikely. Cosyntropic stimulation test
   0.3->2.8.
   - Taper steroid dose
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Antibiotics discontinued on [**2170-10-27**]
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
   LFTs continue to rise. Also may be secondary to pain medications. Waxes
   and wanes with no set time course.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold pain meds for lethargy/confusion
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets.
   - F/u oncology recs
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding, likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer. Stable overnight after given 1U pRBCs
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   - Check [**Hospital1 **]
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - Cont oxybutinin
   - Cont urojet
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and
   decadron.
   # H/O DVT/PE: Not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].
   # Depression: Continue celexa.
   - Consider getting psychiatry or SW involved given that patient seems
   severely depressed.
   # Pressure Ulcer: Stage II left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing.
   # FEN:  Regular, replete lytes prn.
   # Access : IJ, arterial line
   - D/c arterial line before transfer to floor.
   # PPx: SCDs, PPI.
   # Code:  Full, confirmed with his oncologist
   # Dispo:  Called out - awaiting bed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. He has a history of intermittent hypotension during his previous admission due to blood loss. The current etiology of hypotension is uncertain, but it may be attributed to hypovolemia from blood loss, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient's hematocrit level this morning was 24.9, and he received 2 units of blood transfusion since readmission to the ICU. Hypotension is unlikely to be secondary to blood loss considering the slow trend in hematocrit levels.

The patient has blood cultures from October 24th positive for coag-negative staph, but the result from October 12th is likely representing contamination. There are no signs of fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea, making sepsis unlikely. The cosyntropin stimulation test showed an increase from 0.3 to 2.8, suggesting possible adrenal insufficiency.

The patient also has altered mental status, which is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. His liver function tests continue to rise, and he may also be experiencing delirium due to pain medications. The patient's cancer has been refractory to all therapies and has metastasized to the bone and liver.

Other medical conditions include leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia"
