","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon admission, he was found to have an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), specifically a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's condition has been complicated by acute respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has an unknown origin fever.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation via a CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 348 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 89. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 42 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 118 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 27 mEq/L.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate (HR) of 66 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 151/60 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. He is receiving intravenous (IV) fluids, including heparin sodium and propofol, as well as other ICU medications.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 36.0%, platelet (Plt) count of 350 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.6 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.66, and blood glucose level of 142 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of AMI and current condition, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to more severe conditions like ARDS or pneumonia.
3. Infection: The presence of fever and positive urinalysis (UA) suggests a possible infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of sepsis or septic shock.
4. Thromboembolic Events: Immobility and the use of central venous catheters increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates potential renal dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by hypotension or nephrotoxic medications.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The use of anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in the presence of stress ulcers.
7. Medication Reactions: The patient's medication regimen involves several drugs that can cause adverse reactions or interactions.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's clinical condition and promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

   24 Hour Events:
   --ECHO:The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
   estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
   There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular
   calcification. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic systolic
   function. Severe aortic stenosis. Mild to moderate mitral
   regurgitation.
   --CT chest:Small bilateral pleural effusion. Complete obstruction of
   the left lower lobe bronchus, could be due to foreign body, tumor or
   mucoid impaction with almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
   Minimal septal thickening and
   multifocal ground-glass opacity, could be due to mild interstitial
   edema.  Minimal emphysema. Scattered lymph nodes. Severe aortic
   valvular calcification and mitral annulus calcification. Moderate
   coronary artery calcification.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She presented with severe AS and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was intubated for suspected pulmonary edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Aortic Stenosis (AS): Severe AS can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, and syncope. Complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.

2. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): NSTEMI is a type of heart attack that occurs when there is a partial blockage of a coronary artery. Complications can include further damage to the heart muscle, arrhythmias, heart failure, and even death if not treated promptly.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pulmonary edema, which is a build-up of fluid in the lungs. This can be life-threatening and may require mechanical ventilation support.

4. Lung Cancer: The CT chest findings suggest a possibility of lung cancer, which would change the goals of care. Complications of lung cancer can include spread of the cancer to other parts of the body, respiratory distress, and infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis (AS), chronic heart failure (CHF), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She presented with severe AS and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was intubated for suspected pulmonary edema. 

The patient's current condition includes severe aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 0.8 cm2, moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension. There is also a small bilateral pleural effusion, complete obstruction of the left lower lobe bronchus, and mild interstitial edema on CT chest.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/57 to 169/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Electrolytes are within normal range, except for low magnesium level. Cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. NSTEMI: The patient presented with chest pain that resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin. Enzym"

   24 Hour Events:
   --ECHO:The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
   estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
   There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular
   calcification. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic systolic
   function. Severe aortic stenosis. Mild to moderate mitral
   regurgitation.
   --CT chest:Small bilateral pleural effusion. Complete obstruction of
   the left lower lobe bronchus, could be due to foreign body, tumor or
   mucoid impaction with almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
   Minimal septal thickening and
   multifocal ground-glass opacity, could be due to mild interstitial
   edema.  Minimal emphysema. Scattered lymph nodes. Severe aortic

The patient presented with severe AS and was intubated for suspected pulmonary edema.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of severe AS, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on positive pressure ventilation (CPAP/PSV) to support breathing.
2. Cardiac complications: Severe AS can lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias. The patient has a history of CHF, and there are concerns about dropping the preload due to diuresis in the setting of AS.
3. Infection: The patient has a fever, and there is a suspicion of a urinary tract infection (UTI) based on the urine analysis. The patient has been started on ciprofloxacin for the UTI.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and her history of PVD. Prophylaxis for DVT is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient's medical history includes severe aortic stenosis, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and a previous myocardial infarction. 

ECHO findings reveal moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic systolic function. Severe aortic stenosis was noted, along with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. CT chest showed small bilateral pleural effusion, complete obstruction of the left lower lobe bronchus, minimal septal thickening, and scattered lymph nodes. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 148/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV ventilation with FiO2 of 40%. 

Physical examination revealed normal heart sounds with a systolic murmur radiating to the carotids. The patient had absent pulses in both radial and dorsal pedal arteries. 

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count of 342 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, normal glucose levels, and slightly elevated potassium levels. Other lab values were within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and fever of unknown origin. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are also implemented. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severe aortic stenosis and ongoing myocardial damage from the myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory distress or failure due to complete obstruction of the left lower lobe bronchus and potential development of pneumonia.
3. Sepsis or infection due to fever of unknown origin, which may be secondary to a respiratory or urinary source.
4. Bleeding complications due to prolonged PT/PTT and elevated INR, indicating anticoagulation therapy.
5. Renal dysfunction or failure due to decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels.
6. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to the absence of radial and dorsal pedal pulses, indicating possible peripheral arterial disease and increased risk of embolic events.
7. Malnutrition or poor nutritional status due to inadequate caloric intake in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. She presented with severe aortic stenosis and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was intubated for suspected pulmonary edema and has been receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed 60% mid stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA), aneurysm and 70% mid lesion in the left circumflex artery (LCx), and 80% proximal stenosis in the distal vessel (D2). There was also 40% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) after the second diagonal takeoff.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, and a proton pump inhibitor. She is being treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, diuretics, and has had bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
- Heart rate: 74 bpm
- Blood pressure: 146/57 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Blood glucose: 142 mg/dL
- White blood cell count: 12.1 K/uL

Laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 12.4 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 36.4%
- Platelet count: 362 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
- Troponin-T: 0.66 ng/mL
- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL
- Sodium: 137 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
- Chloride: 101 mEq/L
- Carbon dioxide: 36.4%
- Glucose: 117 mg/dL

The patient's condition is complicated by severe aortic stenosis, NSTEMI, respiratory failure secondary to possible pneumonia with underlying lung disease, and fever with increasing white blood cell count. The patient's family is unclear about her wishes regarding an aortic valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure due to the severe aortic stenosis and pulmonary edema, further respiratory deterioration due to pneumonia or aspiration, and potential kidney injury due to hypotension or sepsis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, acute myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, and fever of unknown origin. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, BAL fluid culture, and cardiac catheterization on 04/05/2143. The patient's temperature has been spiking, leading to the change in antibiotics from ciprofloxacin to zosyn. There is also a questionable left lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray. The patient received prehydration before the cardiac catheterization due to pulmonary edema. The cardiac catheterization results showed significant stenosis in the right coronary artery, left circumflex artery, and distal 2nd diagonal artery. The patient's heparin drip was discontinued, and there are plans to attempt extubation in the morning with a respiratory rate and saturation level assessment. An OG tube was placed, and a family meeting is scheduled for tomorrow. The patient's allergies include anesthesia tray, unknown. The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, and tazobactam (zosyn). The patient is currently on propofol infusion, famotidine (pepcid), furosemide (lasix), and other medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. The patient's vital signs"

","The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. She presented with severe aortic stenosis and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was intubated for suspected pulmonary edema and has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's recent events include bronchoscopy, BAL fluid culture, and cardiac catheterization. The cardiac catheterization revealed 60% mid stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA), an aneurysm in the left circumflex artery (LCx) with 70% mid lesion, and 80% proximal stenosis in the distal vessel (D2), with only 40% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). She was taken off the heparin drip.

The patient's current medications include ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), propofol, famotidine (Pepcid), furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. Her allergies include anesthesia tray.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 74 bpm with a range of 56-76 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 101/42"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. She presented with severe aortic stenosis and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was intubated for suspected pulmonary edema and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed three-vessel disease but likely only intervention would be done on the second diagonal artery in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 

The patient's current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, and a beta-blocker. ACE inhibitors were withheld due to severe aortic stenosis. The heparin drip was discontinued yesterday. 

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema with possible underlying lung disease, fever with increasing white blood cell count suggesting possible pneumonia, and post-obstructive pneumonia with possibility of lung cancer. 

The plan for the patient includes attempting extubation in the morning, bronchoscopy to evaluate for possible bronchial tumor, and a family meeting tomorrow to discuss the patient's wishes regarding further treatment. The patient is also being diuresed with lasix as needed and will undergo a chest CT to evaluate for possible malignancy. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pulmonary edema, possibly due to underlying lung disease."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, and severe aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU due to severe aortic stenosis and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient presented with chest pain, which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin. Enzyme leak and EKG changes were also noted.

Catheterization showed three-vessel disease, but only intervention for the second diagonal artery (D2) might be required during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient is currently on aspirin, atorvastatin, and a beta-blocker. Heparin was discontinued yesterday.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia with underlying lung disease, complicated by aortic stenosis, NSTEMI, and pulmonary edema. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is being provided, and an attempt will be made to extubate the patient today. A chest X-ray will be followed up, and nebulizers will be started today.

The patient has had fevers up to 100.4°F, with an increasing white blood cell count. An abdominal guard tube (OG tube) has been placed. Antibiotics have been changed to Zosyn to cover for suspected aspiration. If the patient spikes a fever today, vancomycin will be"

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis (AS), chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. She presented with severe AS and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was intubated for suspected pulmonary edema and extubated without difficulty yesterday.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 135/57 mmHg to 153/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 7 cm, crackles in bilateral lung bases that clear with coughing, soft S2 heart sound, and an erythematous rash on the palms with small petechiae. The patient's pulses are strong and regular.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 0.79 ng/mL, and elevated lactate level of 1.7 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's current plan includes continuing metoprolol for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was intubated for suspected pulmonary edema. The patient presented with chest pain that resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin, as well as enzyme leakage and EKG changes suggestive of NSTEMI. Coronary catheterization showed three-vessel disease, but only a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) intervention is likely needed. The patient is currently on aspirin, Lipitor, and a beta-blocker. ACE inhibitors are being held off due to AS. Hepatic graft was discontinued as it was thought to be causing chest pain from AS. The patient has a valve area of 0.6 cm2 on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and cardiac surgery consultation is planned for aortic valve replacement (AVR) with CABG. The patient wants to go home first, but the family wants her to have surgery now. The patient's condition is stable, and she can be discharged for further consideration of surgery. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia with underlying lung disease, complicated by AS, NSTEMI, and pulmonary edema. She was extubated without difficulty yesterday"

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She presented with severe AS and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was intubated for suspected pulmonary edema and subsequently developed respiratory failure. She has been extubated without difficulty and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen.

Her current medications include aspirin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. She has a planned aortic valve replacement (AVR) with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but the patient wants to go home first to attend to personal matters before the surgery. The patient's cardiac catheterization showed three-vessel disease, and she is only likely to undergo the AVR procedure.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles at the lung bases that clear with coughing. She has a palpable JVP of 7 cm and a rash on her palms with petechiae. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 135/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels. However, her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. She presented with severe AS and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), for which she was intubated due to suspected pulmonary edema. She has been receiving various medications including aspirin, statin, and beta-blockers. A catheterization yesterday revealed three-vessel disease, and it is likely that only a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) intervention would be required. However, due to her severe AS, the use of vasodilators is avoided. The patient's family is unclear about her wishes regarding the surgery, and a family meeting will be held to discuss further. The patient's respiratory failure is believed to be secondary to pneumonia (PNA) with underlying lung disease, complicated by AS, NSTEMI, and pulmonary edema. She is currently on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) support and will be attempted to be extubated today. A chest X-ray will be followed up, and diuretics will be used cautiously to avoid dropping the preload too much in the setting of AS. A chest CT will also be performed to evaluate for possible malignancy. The patient has developed a fever, and her white blood cell (WBC) count is increasing, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and severe aortic stenosis (AS). She presented with symptoms of severe AS and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was intubated for suspected pulmonary edema and remains sedated. 

She has been on several medications including aspirin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. However, due to her AS, the use of vasodilators and ACE inhibitors has been avoided. Her current medications include metoprolol, famotidine, furosemide, and celexa.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated levels of troponin-T, lactate, and white blood cell count. Other lab results, including kidney function and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

Plan:
1. NSTEMI: The patient presented with chest pain that resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin. She also had enzyme leak and questionable EKG changes. A catheterization yesterday revealed three-vessel disease, and it is likely that only a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) would be required for intervention.
   - Continue ASA 325, Lipitor 80, and beta-blocker.
   - Hold off on ACE inhibitor due to AS.
   - Discontinue heparin drip yesterday"
