","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He presented with a high fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient has been receiving vancomycin through a dirty line placement. Blood cultures, urine culture, and urinalysis were sent. Foley catheter was changed due to pyuria and candiduria. Cordis was removed and the catheter tip was sent for culture. The patient received a transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs due to a drop in hemoglobin from 29 to 24. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, RSBI of 63, PIP of 15 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 6 cmH2O. The patient's ABG shows pH 7.41, PaCO2 42, HCO3- 63, SaO2 99%, Ve 7 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 126.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of high fever, hypotension, and tachycardia suggests sepsis. This is further supported by"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o lady with history HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness now s/p trach after intubation for
   aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty weaning from vent is
   admitted to MICU after bleeding around trach site.
   .
   # Current Respiratory distress:  Current episode is secondary to
   bleeding aroung the trach site.  Though to be secondary to small vessel
   in that area.  ETT placed for ventilation and went to OR where she was
   found to have small vessel bleed and received stitches. Also had
   electrocautery to cauterize any other superficial bleeders.  Thoracics
   is planning for revision today. She was ET intubated by anesthesia
   during the code.
   - Trach revision on [**2-3**]
   - trend HCT
   - active T&C
   .
   # s/p trach: Secondary to pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory distress as
   above.  Completed 10 day course of antibiotics.  Received trials of PMV
   on the floor.
   - Continue nebs
   .
   # GPC bacteremia:  Most likely from the nonsterile fem line placed.
   Already discontinued the fem line.
   - vancomycin
   - surveillence cultures
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:? aspiration PNA on CXR left base, but
   radiologically improved.  GPC bacteremia as above.  Also may have ?
   small pneumo mediatstium per radiology on post code CXR but repeat CXR
   are improved.
   - trend leukocytosis
   -vanc as above
   .
   # Decreased HCT:  Most likely from femoral hematoma.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable.
   - trend HCT
   - ? CT abd/pelvis if continues to trend down to look for RPB
   .
   # Left femoral hematoma:  In the setting of attempted fem line.
   - trend HCT
   - T&C blood as above
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed
   cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV and possible myopathy from
   interferon. Muscle biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation. Per recent
   neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild sensorimotor
   polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several proximal
   muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3 paraspinals).
   Additional nerve biopsy may be helpful, but currently holding off.
   - F/U cryo levels
   - Appreciate neurology input; further management per them
   - MRI brain w/ contrast is ordered per Neurology recs
   .
   # Bulbar weakness: Unclear why bulbar weakness is worsening and the
   rest of weakness is stable on exam. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**] is in the
   differential diagnosis.
   - Follow up AChR antibodies (currently pending)
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: S/p corneal abrasion secondary to orbicularis
   weakness and inability to close eye. Ophthalmology following.
   - Continue eye drops/antibiotic ointments Q2H
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need definitive management (i.e. taping eye) after resolution of
   bacterial infection
   .
   # HCV: Currently off interferon, with undetectable viral loads. On
   nadolol.
   .
   # Dysphagia. Seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux. TF via Dobhoff, continue PPI.
   - will need PEG placement by IR
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH,
   platelets were in the 20's; heparin stopped for concern for HIT; HIT
   antibody now negative. Platelets improved to 100's. Thrombocytopenia
   thought secondary to liver disease.
   .
   # NSTEMI: History of NSTEMI (at OSH), though likely demand ischemia. On
   beta blocker at this time.
   .
   # HCP blood exposure:  Needs paperwork signed for check up once she is
   awake.
   .
   # FEN. Holding on IVF for now. Monitor/replete electrolytes. Tube
   feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI.
   .
   # Access: Fem cortis placed under nonsterile condition, will attemp to
   place peripheral IVs and then remove the fem line
   .
   # Code: FULL CODE
   .
   # Communication: Patient and husband [**Doctor First Name **]. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4821**].
   - She does not wish for extended family to know about HCV status
   .
   # Disposition: pending above

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV), cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing bleeding around the tracheostomy (trach) site. She underwent emergency tracheostomy revision and endotracheal intubation due to respiratory distress. The patient also has a history of NSTEMI, thrombocytopenia, myopathy/neuropathy, bulbar weakness, conjunctivitis, and HCV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to aspiration pneumonia, tracheostomy bleeding, or other underlying lung conditions. Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation is necessary.

2. Tracheostomy Bleeding: The patient has experienced bleeding around the tracheostomy site, which required revision and stitches. Regular assessment of the tracheostomy site and monitoring for any signs of bleeding or infection is crucial.

3. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has dysphagia and laryngeal reflux, which may lead to aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring for symptoms such as coughing, choking, or worsening respiratory status is important. PPI prophylaxis and regular evaluation of swallowing function should be continued.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o lady with history HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness now s/p trach after intubation for
   aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty weaning from vent is
   admitted to MICU after bleeding around trach site.
   .
   # Current Respiratory distress:  Current episode is secondary to
   bleeding aroung the trach site.  Though to be secondary to small vessel
   in that area.  ETT placed for ventilation and went to OR where she was
   found to have small vessel bleed and received stitches. Also had
   electrocautery to cauterize any other superficial bleeders.  Thoracics
   is planning for revision on [**2-3**]. She was ET intubated by anesthesia
   during the code.
   - Trach revision on [**2-3**]
   - trend HCT
   - 2 typed and crossed pRBCs available currently
   .
   # s/p trach: Secondary to pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory distress as
   above.  Completed 10 day course of antibiotics.  Received trials of PMV
   on the floor.
   - Continue nebs
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: In the setting of peridistress.  ? aspiration PNA
   on CXR left base.  Also may have ? small pneumo mediatstium per
   radiology, no urgency but needs to be followed.  Currently afebrile but
   is tachycardic.
   - IVF
   - trend leukocytosis
   - repeat CXR to look at possible pneumomediatinum
   .
   # Decreased HCT:
   - ? CT abd/pelvis
   .
   # Left femoral hematoma:  In the setting of attempted fem line.  No
   need for urgent transfusion
   - trend HCT
   - T&C blood as above
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed
   cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV and possible myopathy from
   interferon. Muscle biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation. Per recent
   neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild sensorimotor
   polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several proximal
   muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3 paraspinals).
   Additional nerve biopsy may be helpful, but currently holding off.
   - F/U cryo levels
   - Appreciate neurology input; further management per them
   - MRI brain w/ contrast is ordered per Neurology recs
   .
   # Bulbar weakness: Unclear why bulbar weakness is worsening and the
   rest of weakness is stable on exam. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**] is in the
   differential diagnosis.
   - Follow up AChR antibodies (currently pending)
   - Possible Tensilon test
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: S/p corneal abrasion secondary to orbicularis
   weakness and inability to close eye. Ophthalmology following.
   - Continue eye drops/antibiotic ointments Q2H
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need definitive management (i.e. taping eye) after resolution of
   bacterial infection
   .
   # HCV: Currently off interferon, with undetectable viral loads. On
   nadolol.
   .
   # Dysphagia. Seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux. TF via Dobhoff, continue PPI.
   - will PEG placement
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH,
   platelets were in the 20's; heparin stopped for concern for HIT; HIT
   antibody now negative. Platelets improved to 100's. Thrombocytopenia
   thought secondary to liver disease.
   .
   # NSTEMI: History of NSTEMI (at OSH), though likely demand ischemia. On
   beta blocker at this time.
   .
   # HCP blood exposure:  Needs paperwork signed for check up once she is
   awake.
   .
   # FEN. Holding on IVF for now. Monitor/replete electrolytes. Tube
   feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI.
   .
   # Access: Fem cortis placed under nonsterile condition, will attemp to
   place peripheral IVs and then remove the fem line
   .
   # Code: FULL CODE
   .
   # Communication: Patient and husband [**Doctor First Name **]. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4821**].
   - She does not wish for extended family to know about HCV status

The patient also has a history of s/p tracheostomy secondary to pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory distress. She completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and received trials of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) on the floor. 

She presents with fever and leukocytosis, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia or small pneumothorax. Her hematocrit (HCT) level is decreasing, and a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis is ordered. 

The patient has a left femoral hematoma from an attempted femoral line. There is no need for urgent transfusion, but her HCT level should be trended.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with Hepatitis C cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU. She presented with neuromuscular and bulbar weakness, and underwent an operation for ligation and cauterization of an arterial bleed at the tracheal site. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and is now experiencing complications related to her condition. She has developed a tracheal bleed, which was ligated during surgery, and is awaiting tracheal revision. The patient also has leukocytosis, likely due to a femoral line placed during resuscitation, and a groin hematoma.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case. These include:

1. Tracheostomy site infection: Given the recent tracheal bleed and revision planned, there is a risk of infection at the tracheostomy site.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. The use of non-invasive ventilation strategies such as head-of-bed elevation and daily wake-up periods can help reduce this risk.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness are risk factors for developing DVT. Measures such as compression stockings and early mobilization should be implemented to prevent this complication.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old female with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with pneumonia and experiencing an arterial bleed from the tracheostomy site. She underwent ligation and cauterization of the bleeder. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. She is also experiencing bacteremia with GPC, which is suspected to be from a femoral line placed during a code. She has a history of neuropathy/myopathy and HCV with cirrhosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Tracheostomy site infection: There is a risk of infection at the tracheostomy site, especially since the patient had an arterial bleed from the site and underwent ligation and cauterization.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to DVT.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis puts her at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status and neuromuscular abnormalities.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's liver disease and potential use of nephrotoxic medications can predispose her to renal dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o lady with history HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness now s/p trach after intubation for
   aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty weaning from vent is
   admitted to MICU after bleeding around trach site.
   1) Respiratory failure:  occurred secondary to bleed around trach.
   ETT was placed emergently for ventilation and small thyroid artery was
   cauterized in OR.  Now s/p revised ETT and successful extubation.
   - PMV trial today
   2) GPC bacteremia:  Most likely from the nonsterile femoral cordis
   placed during code.   Line discontinued on [**2-2**].  Catheter tip also
   with GPC
   - f/u GPC speciation
   - Continue vancomycin
   - f/u surveillence cultures
   - check Vanc level in AM given low body weight
   3) Anemia:  Consider bleed from trach site vs. femoral hematoma
   - continue to trend hct
   4) Myopathy/Neuropathy: Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed
   cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV and possible myopathy from
   interferon. Muscle biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation. Per recent
   neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild sensorimotor
   polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several proximal
   muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3 paraspinals).
   Additional nerve biopsy may be helpful, but currently holding off.
   MRI without any intracranial abnormality to explain symptoms.
   - F/U cryo levels
   - Neurology following closely
   - patient declined LP today
   - [**Name (NI) 4854**] PT today
   # Bulbar weakness: Unclear why bulbar weakness is worsening and the
   rest of weakness is stable on exam. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**] is in the
   differential diagnosis.
   - f/u antiMUSK ab
   - AChR antibody negative
   # Conjunctivitis: S/p corneal abrasion secondary to orbicularis
   weakness and inability to close eye.
   - Ophthalmology following.
   - Continue eye drops/antibiotic ointments Q2H
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need definitive management (i.e. taping eye) after resolution of
   bacterial infection
   # HCV: Currently off interferon, with undetectable viral loads.
   - Continue nadolol.
   - Patient requests that HCV infection not be disclosed to extended
   family.
   # Dysphagia. Seen by Neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - S&S reevaluation today, now s/p extubation
   - will proceed with PEG placement by IR prior to discharge
   # Thrombocytopenia: Baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH,
   platelets were in the 20's; heparin stopped for concern for HIT; HIT
   antibody now negative. Platelets improved to 100's. Thrombocytopenia
   thought secondary to liver disease.
   - continue to trend
   - avoid heparin products
   # FEN:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old lady with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, and recent tracheostomy. She was admitted to the MICU for bleeding around the tracheostomy site. The patient underwent emergent intubation and tracheostomy revision due to respiratory failure caused by the bleed. She was successfully extubated and is now on noninvasive ventilation support.

The patient has several medical complications including:

1. GPC bacteremia: Most likely from a nonsterile femoral cordis placed during a code. The line was discontinued, and the catheter tip also showed GPC. She is being treated with vancomycin, and surveillance cultures are being monitored.

2. Anemia: This could be due to bleeding from the tracheostomy site or a femoral hematoma. Her hemoglobin levels are being trended.

3. Myopathy/Neuropathy: The patient has mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV and possible myopathy from interferon. Muscle biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation, and an additional nerve biopsy may be helpful. EMG showed mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy and myopathic process in proximal muscles.

4. Bulbar weakness: The patient's worsening bulbar weakness is unclear, and myasthenia gravis is considered in the differential diagnosis. AntiMUSK antibody testing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, and recent tracheostomy placement. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to bleeding around the tracheostomy site, which required emergency intubation and surgery. She also has a femoral line-related bacteremia with GPC, likely from a nonsterile femoral line placement. Other issues include aspiration pneumonia, fever, leukocytosis, decreased hemoglobin level possibly due to a femoral hematoma, left femoral hematoma, myopathy/neuropathy related to mixed cryoglobulinemia and possible myopathy from interferon treatment, bulbar weakness, conjunctivitis, HCV, dysphagia, thrombocytopenia, and a history of NSTEMI. The patient's code status is full code.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with respiratory failure, weakness, tracheal bleed, and line infection. She underwent an operation for ligation and cauterization of a tracheal bleed and has been intubated. The patient had a revision of her tracheostomy and is now being weaned off ventilator support. She also had a femoral line placed, which was subsequently removed due to infection. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, blood pressure ranging from 190/144 mmHg to 96/65 mmHg, heart rate between 92-109 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's neurologic examination shows neuromuscular and bulbar weakness, but an MRI did not reveal any brainstem lesion. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is being treated for CNS bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure. She requires invasive ventilation and has a history of tracheal bleed and line infection, which can further compromise her respiratory function.
2. Tracheal Reconstruction: The patient underwent cautery of tracheal bleed and had a recent tracheostomy revision. There is a risk of tracheal reconstruction complications such as restenosis, stenosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with respiratory failure, tracheal bleed, line infection, and neuromuscular weakness. She underwent tracheal reconstruction after a bleed and had a recent revision of her tracheostomy. She is currently planned for weaning off invasive ventilation. The patient has several medical complications, including fever, tracheal reconstruction, respiratory failure, corneal abrasion, myopathy, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Tracheal Bleed: The patient had a tracheal bleed that required surgical intervention. There is a risk of recurrence or further bleeding.
3. Line Infection: The patient has a line infection, which could lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Myopathy: The patient is diagnosed with myopathy, which can result in muscle weakness and difficulty with movement.
5. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be indicative of an underlying infection or inflammatory condition.
6. Corneal Abrasion: The patient has a corneal abrasion, which requires proper management to prevent complications such as infection or vision impairment.
7. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: The patient's underlying liver condition may contribute to various complications, including impaired liver function and increased vulnerability to infections.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis. She presented with respiratory failure, weakness, tracheal bleed, and line infection. The patient underwent tracheal reconstruction after experiencing a bleed during an operation. She also had an orotracheal intubation and a revision of her tracheostomy. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 190/144 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on invasive ventilation and receiving oxygen through a tracheal mask with a FiO2 of 50%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's assessment includes fever, tracheal reconstruction, respiratory failure, myopathy (bulbar and facial weakness, extremity weakness improved), and corneal abrasion. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and potential infections due to the presence of lines and tubes. 

Please note that this is a summary of the provided information and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is advised for accurate assessment and management of the patient's condition."
