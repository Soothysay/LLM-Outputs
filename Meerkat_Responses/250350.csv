","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with metastatic esophageal cancer who presented to the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress following esophageal stent placement. She has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and a rash from previous antibiotic use. The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate for pain relief. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/70 to 156/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She is alert and oriented, with no gross motor or sensory deficits. The patient has coarse rhonchi diffusely in her lungs but no wheezes. Her recent lab results show a white blood cell count of 23.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 116 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's presentation of respiratory distress and presumed aspiration following esophageal stent placement indicates a potential complication related to the procedure. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address this issue.
2. Pneumonia: Given the patient's symptoms of respiratory distress, coarse rhonchi in the lungs, and recent aspiration event,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with metastatic esophageal cancer who presented to the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress following esophageal stent placement. She has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and received metronidazole, which may have caused a rash. The patient is currently on morphine sulfate for pain management. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/70 to 156/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She is alert and oriented, with no gross motor or sensory deficits. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and platelets, with slightly low hemoglobin and glucose levels. The patient is being treated for respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, GERD, and a history of shingles. She is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, bronchodilators, and other medications as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's recent respiratory distress following esophageal stent placement suggests the possibility of aspiration pneumonia or chemical pneumonitis due to gastric contents. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary, along with appropriate antibiotic coverage if needed.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently irregular but not on antico"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with metastatic esophageal cancer who presented to the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress and presumed aspiration following esophageal stent placement. The patient's recent 24-hour events include an increase in the dose of diltiazem to 90 mg per oral every 4 hours (from 60 mg every 4 hours) for atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 130-140s and blood pressure in the 90s. She is currently asymptomatic.

The patient has allergies to sulfa antibiotics, specifically sulfonamide antibiotics, and has experienced a rash as a reaction. The last dose of antibiotics, metronidazole, was given on [**2111-8-24**] at 04:56 PM.

The patient is receiving several ICU medications, including famotidine (Pepcid), started on [**2111-8-25**] at 08:27 AM, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), started on [**2111-8-25**] at 10:00 PM, and morphine sulfate, started on [**2111-8-26**] at 05:07 AM.

There have been no changes to the patient's medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 50.4 kg, which is slightly lower than her admission weight of 51.6 kg. The patient's height remains unchanged at 64 inches.

Fluid balance indicates a total input of 1,040 mL, with 300 mL via the oral route, 740 mL via the intravenous fluids, and 69 mL via other routes. The total output is 1,010 mL, including 205 mL of blood products, 1,010 mL of urine, and 30 mL of drain output. The fluid balance is -136 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 94%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided in the note. Physical examination findings include an elderly female who is lying flat in bed, with eyes opening spontaneously, sclera anicteric, dry mucous membrane, and clear lungs. There is no jugular venous distention, no cervical lymphadenopathy, and the trachea is midline. The patient's cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The pulmonary examination shows clear lung fields bil"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with metastatic esophageal cancer who presented to the ICU with respiratory distress and suspected aspiration following esophageal stent placement. The patient is currently comfortable on 3 liters of oxygen and has a stable chest X-ray. The plan is to hold on the CT scan for now and repeat labs. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium are being administered as needed, and the patient's oxygen will be weaned as tolerated.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on diltiazem and amiodarone. Although she was irregular on examination, she is now in sinus rhythm with only one episode of atrial fibrillation this morning that quickly resolved. She is not currently on anticoagulation.

The patient's blood pressure is stable, and she is continuing with her home regimen of diltiazem for hypertension. Her gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is also stable, and she will continue with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.

The patient still experiences some tenderness related to shingles, which occurred 7 weeks prior. She will continue with gabapentin and shingles precautions.

The patient has been placed on prophylactic heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. There are no current concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea. They have a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), which resulted in a rash. The patient has been receiving various medications, including diltiazem, famotidine, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate.

The vital signs show that the patient's temperature is within normal range, but their blood pressure is low at 89/53 mmHg. The heart rate is slightly elevated at 96 bpm, respiratory rate is within normal limits at 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has decreased from 51.6 kg to 50.4 kg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1040 mL and output of 1010 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 30 mL. The urine output is within normal limits at 1010 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///25/.

The physical examination findings are limited due to the fact that peripheral pulses, skin assessment, neurologic examination, and other systems were not assessed. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 23.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 35.0%, and decreased plate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with metastatic esophageal cancer who presented to the ICU with respiratory distress and presumed aspiration after esophageal stent placement. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 89/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently stable and comfortable on room air, with no dyspnea reported.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which she is taking diltiazem and amiodarone. She experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 140s yesterday, and her diltiazem dose was increased. She is not currently on anticoagulation therapy. The increase in atrial fibrillation and heart rate may be secondary to an infection from aspiration pneumonia. It is planned to continue the current dose of diltiazem and amiodarone and monitor vital signs closely.

The patient also has a history of hypertension, which is currently stable. She is being monitored for any changes in blood pressure.

The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is currently receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation and dyspnea. The patient's urine analysis (UA) was positive, so he was started on levo/flagy coverage with pending culture results. His heart rate has been controlled with diltiazem (dilt) 90 QID, but there have been breakthrough episodes of tachycardia and hypotension that responded to fluid boluses.

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with metastatic esophageal cancer who presented to the hospital with respiratory distress and presumed aspiration following esophageal stent placement. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not currently on anticoagulation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/61 mmHg to 119/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals mild wheezes throughout the lungs and no gross motor or sensory deficits.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Her electrolyte levels are relatively stable, with slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels. Her renal function is within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening left upper and lower lobe consolidation with new right lower lobe tenting and effusion. She is currently being treated for acute pain, atrial fibrillation, dyspnea, and possible pneumonia.

The patient's pain is being managed with appropriate medications, and her atrial fibrillation is being monitored closely. The patient's hypertension is under control, and she is receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with metastatic esophageal cancer who presented to the hospital after experiencing respiratory distress and presumed aspiration following esophageal stent placement. The patient had a previous episode of respiratory distress at noon, but was comfortable on room air in the morning. She had an acute episode of respiratory distress after consuming some sips and a 1L bolus in the AM. There is concern for re-aspiration event or flash pulmonary edema. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
2. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB)
3. Dyspnea (shortness of breath)

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-aspiration event vs flash pulmonary edema: The patient experienced an acute episode of respiratory distress after consuming liquids, which raises concern for re-aspiration or flash pulmonary edema.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of metastatic esophageal cancer and recent aspiration event, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
3. Infection: The patient's increased heart rate and atrial fibrillation may be secondary to an infection from aspiration pneumonia.
4. Positive urine analysis: The patient has a positive urine analysis, indicating the presence of a urinary tract infection (UTI).
5. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease): The patient has stable GERD symptoms, which need to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with metastatic esophageal cancer who presented to the hospital with respiratory distress and suspected aspiration after undergoing palliative esophageal stent placement. The patient's current condition is stable, but there have been episodes of respiratory distress. She is experiencing atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a positive urine analysis without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating fluid loss. She is receiving appropriate medications for pain control, atrial fibrillation, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient is on a thick nectar diet and is being monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of respiratory distress and presumed aspiration events, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate management with antibiotics may be necessary.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events. Anticoagulation therapy may be required to prevent such complications.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's negative fluid balance indicates fluid loss. This could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring fluid intake and output, along with appropriate fluid replacement, is essential to manage this condition.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although the patient does not exhibit typical symptoms of a UTI, the positive urine analysis suggests the possibility of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient had an episode of respiratory distress that improved with nebulizer treatments, possibly due to aspiration. The CT angiography (CTA) showed no pulmonary embolism (PE), but there was an atelectasis present, along with possible secretions in the esophagus and distal soft tissue density. 

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and has received levofloxacin and metronidazole antibiotics in the past. She is currently on several medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix), and morphine sulfate. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate ranging from 68-127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/50-135/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient's physical examination reveals mild wheezes throughout the lungs, no jugular venous distention (JVD), and no cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient is alert and oriented, with no gross motor or sensory deficits noted.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine levels, but other parameters such as hemoglobin (H"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress, which improved with nebulizer treatments. It is mentioned that this could be due to aspiration. Lasix was given as a bolus. The patient underwent a CT angiography (CTA), which showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed atelectasis and possible secretions in the esophagus and distal soft tissue density. The gastrointestinal system is not currently a concern unless there is clinical concern such as obstruction or recurrent aspiration events.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate is 80 bpm (68-127 bpm), blood pressure is 97/83 mmHg (90/50-135/83 mmHg), respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute (21-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current weight is 50.4 kg, with a height of 64 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,381 mL (with 320 mL given orally), output of 2,150 mL (including 300 mL of blood products), and a negative balance of 770 mL.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
   Pt is a 86yo F with metastatic esophageal ca presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] after
   respiratory distress and presumed aspiration following esophageal stent
   placement.
   . #. A-fib with episodes of RVR: Pt with h/o a-fib.  Has been
   converting back and forth on A.fib. Not on anti-coagulation. Increased
   a-fib and HR may be secondary to an infection from aspiration
   pneumonia. Will stay the course with current dose of amio and monitor
   vital signs.  Dilt was increased to 90 QID w/ a moderate response, but
   HR still in the 100-110s. Started metoprolol 12.5 PO bid on [**8-26**] for
   better HR control. Increased metoprolol to TID on [**8-27**].

   # Resp Distress: Pt with metastatic esophageal ca presents after
   palliative esophageal stent placement. Pt with resp distress with
   desaturation to 89% and tachypnea to 34. Thought to be due to
   aspiration. This morning the patient is comfortable on 2L NC and is
   reporting no dyspnea. Had possible aspiration event witnessed
   yesterday. CT chest showed no PE, responded to Lasix IV. S/S
   recommendation for thick nectar.
   - for acute exacerbation: STAT CXR, abg, lasix 20 iv x1, nebs
   - cont ipratropium q6. Hold albuerol given tachycardia.
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - cont  levo/flagyl (day 1 is [**8-26**]) for empiric treatment of aspiration
   PNA
   - Consider Lasix IV treatment if think clinically fluid overloaded.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with metastatic esophageal cancer who presented to the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress and presumed aspiration following esophageal stent placement. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not on anticoagulation. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate in the 80s, blood pressure around 100/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 2L nasal cannula. The patient is currently on pain medication, amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, diltiazem for blood pressure control, and metoprolol for heart rate control. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and stress ulcer medication. The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory distress and is comfortable on 2L NC. She is alert and oriented, with no focal neurologic deficits. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event and CT scan findings suggest possible aspiration into the right lower lobe bronchus and layering of material within the lower esophageal wall stent. This increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The CT scan findings indicate a large pulmonary artery, which may suggest pulmonary hypertension.
3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The CT scan findings also show large bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and poor"
