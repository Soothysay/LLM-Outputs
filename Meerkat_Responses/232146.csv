   Assessment and Plan
   65 y/o F with PMHx of AAA s/p endovasc repair, HTN, Stroke, Afib and
   myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] who presented with generalized weakness, UTI and
   hypercalcemia.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Calcium of 15.9 on admission with baseline in the 9s.
   Ionized Ca still elevated to 1.65.  Given h/o lung cancer (likely small
   cell) have to consider paraneoplastic syndromes.  Also must consider
   another primary malignancy as cause, possibly thymoma given h/o
   myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **].  Difficult volume assessment although doesn't appear
   significantly dehydrated after getting IVF in ED.
   -hold oral calcium replacement
   -bolus 2L IVF with lasix
   -continue aggressive hydration 250cc/hr
   -Pamidronate 60mg IV x 1
   -t/b with renal in am
   -trend ionized Ca q6hrs
   -follow serial neuro exams
   -send PTH & PTHrp
   -t/b with outpt oncologist in am
   -f/u repeat CXR in am (re-evaluate right hilum)
   .
   # Weakness: Differential is broad but includes hypercalcemia, UTI and
   myasthenia crisis in this pt who has had generalized weakness for the
   past few weeks.  Pt saw her neurologist approx two weeks ago for these
   symptoms and note mentions that the changes in her meds should improve
   symptoms over next two weeks.  Suspect she is near her baseline as her
   NIF is -50 here and baseline is -60.  Seen by neurology in the ED who
   feel infection is causing her symptoms rather than myasthenic crisis.
   Currently, sating well on RA though desats with sleeping likely due to
   apnea/OSA.  Pt is a chronic CO2 retainer with elevated serum bicarb,
   will need to monitor hypoventilation in setting of acute on chronic
   weakness.
   -continue home dose of Mestinon
   -continue home dose of Prednisone 40mg daily
   -t/b with outpt neurologist regarding imuran/cellcept dosing
   -avoid medications which may worsen myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]
   -treat hypercalcemia as above
   -monitor resp status, goal sats of 90-92%
   -serial neuro exams and ABGs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from baseline 1.0 to 1.5 on
   admission.  Suspect may be prerenal as somewhat dry on exam.  Will give
   IVFs and recheck BMP.  Hypercalcemia likely causing dehydration and
   possibly contributing to ARF.
   -hold digoxin for now
   -continue IVF and trend creatinine
   -send urine lytes & urine Ca
   .
   # UTI: Leukocytosis and infected U/A on admission with urine culture
   pending. Started on ceftriaxone in the ED.
   -f/u urine cx
   -trend WBCs
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Possibly secondary to contraction in setting of
   hypercalcemia and likely dehydration.
   - repeat lytes and ABG in am after hydration
   .
   # HTN: SBPs in the 150s-180s.  Unclear if she took her home BP meds
   this am.  Planned to hold her diuretics and beta blockers given
   potential for MG exacerbation but needed to treat BP.
   - increase Hydralazine 50mg q6hr
   - increase Metoprolol 25mg TID
   - lasix 40mg IV x 1
   - holding HCTZ given hypercalcemia
   .
   # Elevated lactate: Likely secondary to dehydration and UTI.  Will
   recheck after hydration.
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Afib: Currently in A fib and anticoagulated with INR of 2.3. Will
   hold home digoxin as EKG showed signs of digoxin changes per
   cardiology.  Dig level 1.7.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a medical history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, hypertension, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and myasthenia gravis. She presented with generalized weakness, urinary tract infection (UTI), and hypercalcemia.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level was 15.9 on admission with a baseline in the 90s. The ionized calcium is still elevated at 1.65. Given her history of lung cancer (likely small cell) and myasthenia gravis, paraneoplastic syndromes and another primary malignancy (such as thymoma) should be considered. Aggressive hydration and treatment with pamidronate are planned to address the hypercalcemia.

2. Weakness: The patient's generalized weakness could be due to hypercalcemia, UTI, or myasthenic crisis. She has been experiencing these symptoms for a few weeks, and her neurologist noted that the changes in her medications should improve symptoms over the next two weeks. The patient's negative inspiratory force (NIF) is -50, which is close to her baseline of -60. The neurology team in the ED believes that infection is causing her symptoms rather than myasthenic crisis. Monitoring of respiratory status and serial neuro exams is advised.

3. Acute renal failure"

   about myasthenic crisis- will give Imuran 100mg today and plan to start
   plasma pheresis.  Currently, sating well on RA though desats with
   sleeping likely due to apnea/OSA.  Pt is a chronic CO2 retainer with
   elevated serum bicarb, will need to monitor hypoventilation in setting
   of acute on chronic weakness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a medical history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, hypertension, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and myasthenia gravis. She presented with generalized weakness, urinary tract infection, and hypercalcemia. The patient's current condition includes hypercalcemia, acute renal failure, metabolic alkalosis, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are still elevated, which can lead to various complications such as dehydration, renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurologic disturbances.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from baseline, indicating possible prerenal acute kidney injury. If not managed appropriately, it could progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has a complicated acid-base status with chronic respiratory acidosis due to COPD. There is a concern for superimposed non-gap metabolic alkalosis, which needs close monitoring and correction.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is in the range of 150s-180s. If not controlled, it can lead to end-organ damage and cardiovascular events.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and is anticoagulated. There is a risk of thromboembolic events if not managed appropriately.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing hypercalcemia, respiratory distress, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient has a history of lung cancer treated in 2016. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory distress: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress, which can be attributed to chronic hypercapnia and underlying lung disease. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels is essential to avoid worsening hypercapnia and to detect hypoventilation.

2. Hypercalcemia-related complications: The patient has elevated calcium levels with low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. This could be related to treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and calcium supplementation. It is important to monitor calcium levels and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent complications associated with hypercalcemia, such as kidney damage or cardiac arrhythmias.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, along with a history of lung cancer, increase the risk of developing pneumonia. Regular assessment of lung sounds and appropriate infection control measures should be implemented to prevent pneumonia.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic anticoagulation should be administered to reduce the risk of DVT.

5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged bed rest can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and appropriate skin care measures should be"

Hypercalcemia has improved to 9.9 mg/dL today after treatment with calcitonin and pamidronate.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a medical history of AAA post-endovascular repair, hypertension, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and myasthenia gravis. She presented with generalized weakness, urinary tract infection (UTI), and hypercalcemia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 92/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. She is currently in atrial fibrillation with an irregularly irregular rhythm.

The physical examination reveals clear lungs, no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds, a soft and non-tender abdomen, and well-perfused extremities with 5-12 muscle strength and intact sensation. 

Laboratory results show an elevated calcium level of 13.5, slightly low potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, and elevated white blood cell count of 11.3. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypercalcemia, likely secondary to paraneoplastic syndromes due to a history of lung cancer, possibly thymoma, or another primary malignancy. There is also a concern for myasthenic crisis given her generalized weakness.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress, myasthenia gravis, hypercalcemia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 87/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient is well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. 

The patient has undergone plasmapheresis catheter placement and has a history of allergies to erythromycin base. They have received ceftriaxone as the last dose of antibiotics on 08/17/2122 at 04:07 PM. 

The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 8,790 mL of fluids since midnight, with an input of 750 mL of PO and 8,040 mL of IVF. The output includes 5,735 mL of blood products and 1,080 mL of urine. The respiratory support consists of an oxygen delivery device - nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 96%. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg, PaO2 of 61 mmHg, HCO3- of 26 mEq/L, and K+ of 7.9 mEq/L.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal pupils, no conjunctival pallor or scleral edema, normocephalic head, no endotracheal or NG tube, and normal cardiovascular examination with regular heart rhythm. The respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion, resonant percussion, clear breath sounds with few crackles bilaterally, no wheezes, diminished bilaterally, no absent breath sounds, and no rhonchi. The extremities are warm and without edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. The neurologic examination shows an attentive patient who is alert, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, with purposeful movements and normal muscle tone.

The laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, leukocyte count of 167 K/uL, platelet count of 138 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 166 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal ranges. The imaging reveals no infiltrates on the chest X-ray, but there is a mildly enlarged central pulmonary artery.

The assessment and plan include hypercalcemia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, respiratory distress, renal failure, and mention that the patient appears stronger and more alert today, with improved calcium levels, and the plan is to continue monitoring vital capacity daily, start plasmaph"

   65 y/o F with PMHx of AAA s/p endovasc repair, HTN, Stroke, Afib and
   myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] who presented with generalized weakness, UTI and
   hypercalcemia.
   .
   # Weakness: Neurology following. Differential is broad but includes
   hypercalcemia, UTI and myasthenia crisis in this pt who has had
   generalized weakness for the past few weeks.  Continuing Imuran 100mg
   and plasma pheresis (s/p 1 session, next one tomorrow).  Currently,
   sating well on RA though desats with sleeping likely due to apnea/OSA.
   Pt is a chronic CO2 retainer with elevated serum bicarb, will need to
   monitor hypoventilation in setting of acute on chronic weakness.
   -continue home dose of Mestinon, Prednisone 40mg, Imuran 100mg
   -avoid medications which may worsen myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]
   -starting pheresis today with plan for 5 sessions
   -next pheresis tomorrow (OMR note erroneously says [**2122-8-26**])
   -f/u neurology recs

   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Ca continues to be 9s s/p calcitonin and pamidronate.
   Endocrine following.  PTH up to 50 from 16 on admission.  Given h/o
   lung cancer (likely small cell) have to consider paraneoplastic
   syndromes.  Also must consider another primary malignancy as cause,
   possibly thymoma given h/o myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **].  Could also be due to her
   large HCTZ dose and supplemental calcium intake.
   -hold oral calcium replacement and home HCTZ
   -s/p Pamidronate 60mg IV x 1 and calcitonin 300U q6
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -follow serial neuro exams
   -f/u PTHrp

   .
   # Acute renal failure: Improving but creatinine still elevated from
   baseline 1.0.  Hypercalcemia on admission likely causing dehydration
   and possibly contributing to ARF.
   -holding digoxin for now
   -trend creatinine
   -f/u urine lytes & urine Ca
   - off home lisinopril
   .
   # Dropping hct: Hct drop 42 -> 32 since admission.  Suspect this is
   mostly [**2-9**] hemoconcentration on admission and down after volume
   repletion.  No e/o active bleeding.  Will check haptoglobin to r/o
   hemolysis as she has an autoimmune disorder and may be hemolyzing.
   -f/u haptoglobin
   -guaiac stools
   -trend hct

   # UTI: Continuing ceftriaxone for Proteus seen in urine.
   -sensitive to ceftriaxone, day [**3-10**] today
   -trend WBCs
   ..
   # HTN: SBPs elevated o/n after holding hydralazine.  Will continue BP
   regimen as below and monitor:
   - Hydralazine 50mg q6hr
   - Metoprolol 25mg TID
   -off lisinopril and HCTZ
   .
   # Afib: Currently in A fib and anticoagulated with Coumadin at home.
   Can
t restart her Coumadin pheresis modified coag factors and difficult
   to monitor INR.  Pt started on heparin drip.  To be held 1-2h prior to
   pheresis.  PTT to be drawn 4-6h after pheresis and heparin restarted.
   - increase metoprolol as above
   - holding digoxin due to ARF
   - monitor PTT for heparin sliding scale
   .
   # CXR abnormalities: ?Pulmonary artery hypertension vs hilar fullness.
    Plan for chest CT to eval today as she has a h/o lung cancer.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are in the 9s and have not returned to normal despite treatment with calcitonin and pamidronate. The elevated PTH level suggests that hypercalcemia may be due to primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy-related hypercalcemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is still elevated from baseline, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction. The hypercalcemia on admission may have contributed to the acute renal failure through dehydration and renal tubular obstruction. Monitoring of renal function and urine electrolytes is necessary.

3. Myasthenia crisis: The patient has a history of myasthenia gravis, and generalized weakness for the past few weeks raises concerns for a myasthenic crisis. Continuing immunosuppressive therapy (Imuran) and plasma pheresis are recommended.

4. UTI: The patient is being treated for a Proteus urinary tract infection with ceftriaxone. Close monitoring of white blood cell count is important to assess the response to treatment.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated overnight after holding hydralazine. Adjustments to the antihypertensive regimen will be made, including continuing hydralazine, metoprolol, and holding lisin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia due to a combination of factors including lung cancer (possibly small cell), thymoma, HCTZ dose, and supplemental calcium intake. This condition needs to be managed with medications like calcitonin and pamidronate, and the patient should avoid oral calcium replacement and home HCTZ.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has ARF with elevated creatinine levels. The hypercalcemia on admission may have caused dehydration and possibly contributed to ARF. Close monitoring of creatinine levels, urine electrolytes, and urine calcium is necessary.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which is complicated by chronic respiratory acidosis from COPD. Monitoring ABG (arterial blood gas) is important in this case.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is being treated for a UTI caused by Proteus bacteria. Sensitivity to ceftriaxone is observed, and the WBC count should be trended.

5. Myasthenia Crisis: The patient's generalized weakness could be due to myasthenia crisis. Continuing Imuran and starting plasma pheresis are recommended. Monitoring respiratory status, serial neuro exams, and ABGs is important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a medical history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, hypertension, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and myasthenia gravis. She presented with generalized weakness, urinary tract infection, and hypercalcemia. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating vital capacities and negative inspiratory forces. She is currently being treated with plasmapheresis, Mestinon, Prednisone, and Imuran. There are concerns about her respiratory status, given her chronic CO2 retention and elevated serum bicarbonate. The patient also has a right infrahilar density on chest CT, which is concerning for malignancy, particularly given her history of small cell lung cancer. A PET CT scan is recommended to evaluate the lesion for neoplasm. Diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis may be considered pending PET results. The patient's hypercalcemia is decreasing, although calcium levels remain in the 9s following calcitonin and pamidronate treatment. There is a concern for paraneoplastic syndromes, especially considering her history of lung cancer. The patient's acute renal failure is improving, but her creatinine level is still elevated from baseline. Her hypertension is being managed with medication adjustments. There is a concern about her dropping hemoglobin levels, which may be due to hemoconcentration. A UTI has been completed, and the patient is currently on a heparin drip for atrial fibrillation."

   Disposition: If respiratory status stable today, may be called out
","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a medical history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, hypertension, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and myasthenia gravis. She presented with generalized weakness, urinary tract infection, and hypercalcemia.

The patient has been experiencing progressive weakness and has had a decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) while nasal inspiratory forces (NIF) have been fluctuating between -20 to -50. She is currently on RA (likely referring to respiratory assistance) and desaturates during sleep, which could be due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient is a chronic CO2 retainer with elevated serum bicarbonate, so hypoventilation needs to be monitored.

The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored, aiming for oxygen saturation levels between 90-92%. Serial neuro exams are also necessary. Plasmapheresis is planned for today as part of the treatment.

Regarding the right infrahilar density seen on imaging, there is a concern for malignancy, especially considering the patient's history of likely small cell lung cancer. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan may be recommended to evaluate the lesion for neoplasm. If the oncologist has not already performed this, it should be postponed until after antibiotic treatment for the potentially infectious lesion in the left apex to avoid a false positive finding.

The patient's hypercalcemia is decreasing, although calcium levels continue to be in"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, anemia, and a history of myasthenia gravis. She is currently stable with no acute distress, but has been experiencing increased cough and chest congestion. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for atrial fibrillation. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on a nasal cannula, and her ABG results are normal. She has a history of hypertension, bronchiectasis, and hypercalcemia. Imaging shows a small area of bronchiectasis at the left apex and an infrahilar density on the right, which has not changed since the previous CT scan. The patient is being treated with azithromycin for a suspected infection and will undergo a PET scan to assess a new sclerotic lesion. She also has an old pleural effusion. The patient is currently on heparin infusion for atrial fibrillation and is receiving prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory infection: The patient's increased cough and chest congestion could indicate a respiratory infection, which may worsen her respiratory distress.
2. Pleural effusion: The presence of an old pleural effusion increases the risk"
