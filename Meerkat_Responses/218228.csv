","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 89-year-old male with a medical history of CVA, DM type 2, and hypothyroidism.
- He presented with intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia.
- Workup for pulmonary embolism was negative.
- Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a new wall motion abnormality, suggesting ischemia.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/52-131/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.
- Physical examination revealed a normal cardiac auscultation with a II/IV systolic murmur at the apex, no chest wall deformities, and dry crackles throughout the lungs.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, as well as decreased potassium and troponin-T levels.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating.
- The patient's condition has been stable without further episodes of chest pain since admission.
- The patient agreed to proceed with a cardiac catheterization in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's symptoms of intermittent anterior chest discomfort, along with the presence of a new wall motion abnormality on TTE, raise concern for ACS. It is crucial to monitor the patient closely and proceed with a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for coronary artery disease.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is below the normal range, indicating hypoxia. Ongoing monitoring and adjustment of oxygen therapy may be necessary. Further evaluation by a pulmonologist is recommended to assess the need for home oxygen therapy after post-interventional revascularization.
3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has evidence of progression of emphysema and interstitial lung disease on the chest CT. This suggests underlying COPD, which can contribute to chronic respiratory symptoms and complications.
4. Diabetes Management: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. It is essential to closely monitor his glycemic control, especially considering the hold on metformin and initiation of insulin therapy.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and it should be managed appropriately with ongoing synthroid therapy.
6. Thromboembolic Disease: Despite a negative workup for pulmonary embolism, there is a need to remain vigilant for potential thromboembolic events due to the patient's immobilization and underlying risk factors. Prophylaxis with heparin may continue as per the current plan.
7. Renal Function: The elevated creatinine level indicates a potential decline in renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and appropriate adjustments in medication dosages may be required."

The patient's risk of all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization is 13% at 14 days, according to the TIMI score. The patient does not want to pursue cardiac catheterization but is willing to consider stress testing after ruling out PE and improvement of hypoxia. The patient has a history of disordered breathing following a stroke and has been off CPAP. He also has a history of tobacco use and likely has underlying lung disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - The patient's symptoms of intermittent anterior chest discomfort, new hypoxia, and ECG changes suggest a possible ACS. The negative cardiac enzymes and elevated D-dimer may indicate a non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) or unstable angina.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - The patient's hypoxia, elevated D-dimer, and new RBBB on ECG raise concerns for a PE. The patient's history of disordered breathing following a stroke, tobacco use, and underlying lung disease further increase the"

","The patient is an 89-year-old male with a medical history of CVA (stroke) in 2003, residual disordered breathing, DM type 2, presenting with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia. Workup for PE (pulmonary embolism) negative, TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) with new wall motion abnormality concerning for ischemia. 

The patient's main complaints are chest pain with wall motion abnormality, hypoxia, history of CVA resulting in complex disordered breathing, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and a large hiatal hernia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/52 to 131/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91%, and sinus rhythm. 

Physical examination findings include a normal appearing head and neck, clear lungs with no chest wall deformities or use of accessory muscles, soft abdomen with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly, and no extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for slightly low potassium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, emphysema, and interstitial lung disease. They have been experiencing chest pain and hypoxemia. The patient's ECHO showed a dilated left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction (EF), akinetic basal segments of the inferior and posterior wall, hypokinetic midventricular segments, and a dilated right ventricle with borderline normal function. There is also moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CT findings include diffuse bronchial wall thickening suggestive of bronchitis, progression of emphysema, slight progression of interstitial lung disease, and a large hiatal hernia. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Cardiac enzymes (CE) are trending up but now peaked, with Troponin levels increasing from <0.01 to 1.13 and then decreasing to 0.12 and 0.11. CK levels have fluctuated between 44, 45, 109, 69, and 58.

The patient has been placed on Plavix at a total dose of 300 mg and started on aspirin (ASA) 325 mg, while holding ACE inhibitor. Potassium levels were repleted. The patient agreed to proceed with a cardiac catheterization in the morning.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 89 y/o M with a PMH of CVA in [**2143**] with residual
   disordered breathing, DM type 2 presenting with four days of
   intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia
   .
   #. Chest Pain - The pt presents with hx of anterior chest discomfort
   occuring at rest for several days, similar to previous episodes which
   occurred during exercise. ECG with new RBBB and ST depressions
   throughout precordium. Symptoms are concerning for cardiac vs pulmonary
   etiology. Cardiac enzymes negative X2, D-dimer elevated.  TIMI score 3
   for age, RF and ST changes giving a 13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause
   mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring
   urgent revascularization. However given concurrent hypoxia, elevated
   D-dimer, and new RBBB also concern for PE.
   - Continue IV heparin
   - Continue Aggrenox
   - Continue lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   - Trend CE - negative X2
   - Pt currently does not want to pursue cardiac catheterization, would
   consider stress testing following rule out of PE, improvement of
   hypoxia
   - Will start pre-contrast hydration for consideration of CTA this am
   .
   #. Hypoxia - The patient with hypoxia requiring NRB, currently weaned
   to 5L NC, no clear evidence of volume overload on exam. Pt has history
   of disordered breathing following stroke, has been off CPAP, also
   history of tobacco use, likely has underlying lung disease. Concern for
   PE as described above
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Discuss risk/benefit of CTA to rule out PE, if no CTA would pursue
   non-contrast Chest CT
   .
   #. Hx of CVA - resulting complex disordered breathing - pt has refused
   further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as outpatient
   - continue aggrenox
   .
   #. HTN - continue lisinopril
   .
   #. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, start insulin SS
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   .
   #. FEN - NPO pending additional CE, then will start cardiac diet
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 89 y/o M with a PMH of CVA in [**2143**] with residual
   disordered breathing, DM type 2 presenting with four days of
   intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia
   .
   #. Chest Pain - The pt presents with hx of anterior chest discomfort
   occuring at rest for several days, similar to previous episodes which
   occurred during exercise. ECG with new RBBB and ST depressions
   throughout precordium. Symptoms are concerning for cardiac vs pulmonary
   etiology. Cardiac enzymes negative X2, D-dimer elevated.  TIMI score 3
   for age, RF and ST changes giving a 13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause
   mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring
   urgent revascularization. However given concurrent hypoxia, elevated
   D-dimer, and new RBBB also concern for PE.
   - Continue IV heparin
   - Continue Aggrenox
   - Continue lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   - Trend CE - negative X2
   - Pt currently does not want to pursue cardiac catheterization, would
   consider stress testing following rule out of PE, improvement of
   hypoxia
   - Will start pre-contrast hydration for consideration of CTA this am
   .
   #. Hypoxia - The patient with hypoxia requiring NRB, currently weaned
   to 5L NC, no clear evidence of volume overload on exam. Pt has history
   of disordered breathing following stroke, has been off CPAP, also
   history of tobacco use, likely has underlying lung disease. Concern for
   PE as described above
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Discuss risk/benefit of CTA to rule out PE, if no CTA would pursue
   non-contrast Chest CT
   .
   #. Hx of CVA - resulting complex disordered breathing - pt has refused
   further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as outpatient
   - continue aggrenox
   .
   #. HTN - continue lisinopril
   .
   #. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, start insulin SS
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   .
   #. FEN - NPO pending additional CE, then will start cardiac diet

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CVA (cerebrovascular accident) in [**2143**], presenting with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia. The patient has a past medical history of disordered breathing following stroke, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and is currently being treated for acute coronary syndrome.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 69-90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/52 mmHg to 131/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable but requires supplemental oxygen.

The physical examination reveals a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 60%, basal segments of the inferior and posterior wall are akinetic, and the midventricular segments are hypokinetic. There is also a dilated right ventricle with borderline normal function, 3+ mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient has a history of tobacco use, likely contributing to underlying lung disease.

The patient's lab results show elevated cardiac enzymes, elevated D-dimer levels, and abnormal electrocardiogram findings including new right bundle branch block (RBBB) and ST depressions"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a medical history of CVA, DM type 2, presenting with intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia. The workup for PE was negative, but there is a TTE showing wall motion abnormality concerning for ischemia. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to RCA. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and he has been off IV heparin. He is currently on Plavix, aspirin, and a beta blocker. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest Pain/WMA - The patient presents with a history of anterior chest discomfort occurring at rest for several days, similar to previous episodes during exercise. There are ECG changes and TTE findings suggestive of ischemia. Close monitoring for recurrent chest pain and further cardiac complications is necessary.

2. Pump - The patient's previous echo shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation is also present. Repeat echo during this admission may be considered to assess any changes.

3. Hypoxia - The patient has a history of disordered breathing following a stroke, progression of emphysema, and ILD on Chest CT. The workup for PE was negative, so ongoing oxygen therapy will be required. Evaluation by Pulmonary as an outpatient and consideration for home oxygen post-postenional revascularization are recommended"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a medical history of CVA (stroke) in 2014, DM type 2, CAD, HTN, hypothyroidism, and hypoxia. The patient presented with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia but no further episodes of chest pain since admission. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and received a stent placement to the RCA (right coronary artery).

The patient's current medications include Plavix, aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, and lisinopril. The patient has a history of disordered breathing following a stroke and has been off CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure). There is evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD (interstitial lung disease) on Chest CT. The workup was negative for PE (pulmonary embolism).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/57 mmHg to 134/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, and diminished pulses in both lower extremities but good DP/PT pulses by doppler. The patient's neurologic examination is not assessed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypothyroidism. He presented with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort, new hypoxia, and was found to have wall motion abnormality concerning for ischemia. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the right coronary artery (RCA). Subsequently, he developed symptoms consistent with viral gastroenteritis, characterized by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 100/49 mmHg, heart rate of 69 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals diminished pulses in the distal extremities, clear breath sounds in the chest, and soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Laboratory results indicate mild anemia, normal white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal cardiac enzymes. Imaging studies show a dilated right ventricular cavity with borderline normal free wall function, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and evidence of mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, including a recent episode of chest discomfort, wall motion abnormality, and stent placement to the RCA. These findings suggest underlying coronary artery disease, which"

","The patient is an 89-year-old male with a past medical history of CVA in 2014, residual disordered breathing, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. He presented with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia. Workup for pulmonary embolism was negative, and he underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the right coronary artery due to a wall motion abnormality concerning for ischemia. Subsequently, he developed gastroenteritis, likely viral. 

The patient's recent ECG showed new right bundle branch block and ST depressions throughout the precordium. His transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction of 60%, basal segments of the inferior and posterior wall being akinetic, midventricular segments being hypokinetic, and a dilated right ventricular cavity with borderline normal free wall function. There was also moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no further episodes of chest pain since admission. He underwent a dual antiplatelet therapy with desquamate to the RCA.

The patient's previous echo demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation was also observed. He should continue aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker therapy. Lisinopril was restarted, and the dosage will be uptitrated as tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 y/o M with a PMH of CVA in [**2143**] with residual disordered breathing,
   DM type 2 presenting with four days of intermittent anterior chest
   discomfort and new hypoxia, work up for PE negative, TTE with new wall
   motion abnormality concerning for ischmia now s/p cardiac catherization
   with stent placement to RCA. Now seems to have developed
   gastroenteritis, likely viral
   .
   #. CAD - ECG with new RBBB and ST depressions throughout precordium.
   TTE EF 60%, basal segments of the inferior and posterior wall are
   akinetic, and the midventricular segments are hypokinetic, RV cavity is
   dilated with borderline normal free wall function, 3+MR, moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No further episodes of chest
   pain since admission. Patient s/p DES to RCA.
   - off IV heparin
   - Continue Plavix, aspirin, beta blocker
   .
   # Pump
 previous echo from [**2-/2146**] demonstrates mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
   - cont aspirin, statin, beta blocker
   - restarted Lisinopril. Uptitrate as tolerated
   #. Hypoxia - Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke,
   has been off CPAP, also has evidence of progression of emphysema and
   ILD on Chest CT. Workup negative for PE
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Will trial diuresis with lasix bolus
   - Appreciate Pulmonary consult recommendations
 concern for UIP/ILD
   and related disordered. Requested labs pending including BNP, ESR, [**Doctor First Name **],
   Anti SCL-70, Anti centromere Ab, RF, hepatitis serologies,
   immunoglobulin levels, SPEP, and UPEP. Also recommended ongoing
   diuresis
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea: Pt developed acute N/V/D this
   admission consistent with a viral gastroenteritis.
   - Already improving after <24hrs
   - Continue IVF and PRN zofran
   .
   #. Hx of CVA - resulting complex disordered breathing - pt has refused
   further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as outpatient
   - aggrexox transitioned to plavix given concern for ACS
   .
   #. HTN - continue lisinopril, metoprolol as above
   .
   #. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, start insulin SS
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   .
