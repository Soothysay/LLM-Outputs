   choledocholithiasis, for which pt underwent ERCP this evening. No
   hypotensive; suspect bacteremia from procedure/manipulation of biliary
   tract. Will cover broadly, given that she has been hospitalized
   recently.
   - IVF bolus to CVP goal [**10-12**]
   - start norepinephrine if needed to keep MAP >=65
   - check ABG, serial lactate

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female who has undergone gastric bypass surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy with choledocholithiasis, and an ERCP due to suspected choledocholithiasis and cholangitis. She has a history of ESBL E. coli UTI and possible pancytopenia. She is currently in the ICU with low blood pressure, requiring norepinephrine infusion. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a mild fever. She has a central line, arterial line, and peripheral IV in her left arm. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible bacteremia following the ERCP procedure. The plan includes IV fluids, norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, ABG, serial lactate, repeat urinalysis, urine cultures, and blood cultures. She is also on medications for chronic pain, hypothyroidism, and folate supplementation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Choledocholithiasis/cholangitis: The patient underwent ERCP for suspected choledocholithiasis, which can lead to cholangitis if not properly managed.
2. Bacteremia/sepsis: The patient may have bacteremia from the ERCP procedure, considering her elevated white blood cell count and vague abdominal complaints.
3. ESBL E. coli UTI: The patient has a known UTI with ESBL E. coli, which can"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

- The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass surgery, recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CCY) for choledocholithiasis, and previous esbl E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI).
- She presented to the hospital with suspected cholangitis secondary to choledocholithiasis and was transferred from another hospital for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
- The patient developed hypotension overnight after the ERCP, likely due to bacteremia from instrumentation.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female who underwent gastric bypass surgery and more recently had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with choledocholithiasis. She also had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that was complicated by sepsis. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, choledocholithiasis/cholangitis, hypoxia, ESBL E coli UTI, chronic pain, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has already experienced sepsis post-ERCP, and there is a risk of further infections due to the presence of central lines and the ongoing UTI.

2. Organ dysfunction: Given the pancytopenia and abnormal liver function tests, there is a risk of organ dysfunction, particularly in the liver and bone marrow.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis, and she requires supplemental oxygen. If her respiratory status worsens, she may develop respiratory failure.

4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has been hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, indicating potential cardiovascular instability. Close monitoring and titration of vasopressors will be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

5. Thromboembolic events: The patient has low platelets and a history of pneum"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass surgery, who presented to the hospital with choledocholithiasis and an ESBL E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). She underwent an ERCP procedure and is now in the ICU for close monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 94/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her temperature is normal.

She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including meropenem, Flagyl for GI anaerobes, and vancomycin for gram-positive coverage due to the suspected bacteremia from the ERCP procedure. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is at goal, and she is receiving norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.

Laboratory results show elevated total bilirubin, slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase, and abnormal white blood cell count with neutrophilia. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal limits.

The patient's pain management medications include fentanyl transdermal, oxycodone, ultram, lidoderm, and methocarbamol. She has a history of pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and gastric bypass surgery, for which she is being followed closely. Her code status has been changed to full code after the ERCP procedure.

The patient's disposition is ICU admission, and her lines include a multi-lumen central line placed today. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been initiated."

   # Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive overnight after the ERCP
   likely secondary to bacteremia after instrumentation.  She received IVF
   and her CVP was resuscitated to 12, however she remained hypotensive
   with SBPs in the 80
s so she was started on levophed.  Lactate 0.3.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with meropenem, flagyl, and
   vancomycin as below
   - F/u BCx, UCx
   - Continue to monitor her BPs via her A-line and continue levophed
   titrating to MAP > 65.
   - Follow her CVP and given IV boluses to maintain it at 10-12.  Goal
   UOP of > 30cc/hr.
   # choledocholithiasis/cholangitis: pt's elevated Tbili, slightly
   elevated alk phos, and vague abd complaints at OSH c/w
   choledocholithiasis, for which pt underwent ERCP yesterday.
   - Manage hypotension as above
   - meropenem, given known UTI with ESBL E coli, flagyl for GI anaerobes,
   and vanc for gram positive coverage
   # Hypoxia: The patient has been requiring 4 L NC. Her ABG was
   7.4/22/188.  CXR showed ***
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated.
   # ESBL E coli UTI: second possible source of infection, although time
   course more consistent with #1, above, as source of sepsis. repeat UA
   showed on 1 WBC, neg leuk, neg nitrite
   - F/u  UCx
   - Continue meropenem as above.
   # Chronic pain: pt on numerous pain meds at home--fentanyl transdermal,
   oxycodone, ultram, as well as lidoderm and methocarbamol.
   - Will continue fentanyl and lidocaine patches
   # pancytopenia: based on records from [**Location (un) 1242**], this has been long
   standing, with WBC [**2-5**], Hct high 20s, and plts ~100, unresponsive to
   IVIG in the past, and has also received B12 supplementation as she is
   s/p gastric bypass, without apparent effect. Hct stable this am at 26,
   WBC increased to 7.1 and plt increased to 104.
   - ollow counts; continue folate
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine 200mcg daily

   # Code: DNR/DNI was reversed for ERCP, so full for now; discussed with
   daugther, who is very reluctant to allow pt to be intubated, but agreed
   that pressors, invasive monitor for sepsis, etc, short of
   cardiorespiratory arrest, was appropriate; if pt worsens and intubation
   seems imminent, would ideally re-discuss with daughter

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass surgery, recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CCY), choledocholithiasis, and an ESBL E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). She was transferred from the outside hospital (OSH) for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after stone removal, which was complicated by sepsis. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension maintained at MAPs in the 60s with norepinephrine (levophed), unable to be weaned. Her CVP has ranged from 8-14. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, including meropenem, flagyl, and vancomycin, and blood cultures are pending. The patient's blood pressure will continue to be monitored via arterial line and norepinephrine will be titrated to maintain MAP >65. 

The patient also has choledocholithiasis/cholangitis, with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. She underwent ERCP on [1-20]. Hypoxia has been weaned to room air. An ESBL E. coli UTI is present, and meropenem will be continued. Chronic pain management is ongoing due to her use of numerous pain medications at home. 

Pancytopenia is a long-standing issue, with unresponsive WBC, Hct, and platelet counts"

   61F s/p gastric bypass and more recently, lap CCY, with
   choledocholithiasis, ESBL E coli UTI, and also ? pna, transferred from
   OSH for ERCP s/p stone removal complicated by sepsis.
   # Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive overnight after the ERCP
   likely secondary to bacteremia after instrumentation.  She received IVF
   and her CVP was resuscitated to 12, however she remained hypotensive
   with SBPs in the 80
s so she was started on levophed.  Lactate 0.3.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with meropenem, flagyl, and
   vancomycin as below
   - F/u BCx, UCx
   - Continue to monitor her BPs via her A-line and continue levophed
   titrating to MAP > 65.
   - Follow her CVP and given IV boluses to maintain it at 8-12.  Goal UOP
   of > 30cc/hr.
   # choledocholithiasis/cholangitis: pt's elevated Tbili, slightly
   elevated alk phos, and vague abd complaints at OSH c/w
   choledocholithiasis, for which pt underwent ERCP yesterday.
   - Manage hypotension as above
   - meropenem, given known UTI with ESBL E coli, flagyl for GI anaerobes,
   and vanc for gram positive coverage
   # Hypoxia: The patient has been requiring 4 L NC. Her ABG was
   7.4/22/188.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated.
   # ESBL E coli UTI: second possible source of infection, although time
   course more consistent with #1, above, as source of sepsis. repeat UA
   showed on 1 WBC, neg leuk, neg nitrite
   - F/u  UCx
   - Continue meropenem as above.
   # Chronic pain: pt on numerous pain meds at home--fentanyl transdermal,
   oxycodone, ultram, as well as lidoderm and methocarbamol.
   - Will continue fentanyl and lidocaine patches, morphine boluses prn
   for pain prior to movement
   # pancytopenia: based on records from [**Location (un) 1242**], this has been long
   standing, with WBC [**2-5**], Hct high 20s, and plts ~100, unresponsive to
   IVIG in the past, and has also received B12 supplementation as she is
   s/p gastric bypass, without apparent effect. Hct stable this am at 26,
   WBC increased to 7.1 and plt increased to 104.
   - follow counts; continue folate
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine 200mcg daily
   # FEN: clears for now, replete lytes prn
   # Access: 22 PIV in L arm, Aline, and left subclavian central line
   # PPx: pneumoboots--no heparin [**2-2**] low plts at OSH; home ppi; bowel
   regimen prn
   # Code: DNR/DNI was reversed for ERCP, so full for now; discussed with
   daugther, who is very reluctant to allow pt to be intubated, but agreed
   that pressors, invasive monitor for sepsis, etc, short of
   cardiorespiratory arrest, was appropriate; if pt worsens and intubation

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female who has a history of gastric bypass surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, choledocholithiasis, and a recent transfer from another hospital for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to a suspected stone in the common bile duct. The patient developed sepsis after the ERCP procedure, which was complicated by choledocholithiasis.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical complications. The assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, cholelithiasis, chronic pain, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, hypoxia, ESBL E coli urinary tract infection (UTI), pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, electrolyte imbalance, central venous catheter, and arterial line.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: If not properly managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock, organ failure, and potentially death.
2. Cholelithiasis: The presence of choledocholithiasis increases the risk of recurrent episodes of cholangitis, pancreatitis, and biliary colic.
3. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may persist or worsen if not adequately managed with appropriate analgesics and interventions.
4. Impaired skin integrity"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, choledocholithiasis, and an ESBL E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). She was transferred from OSH for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, which was complicated by sepsis.
- The patient became hypotensive overnight after the ERCP, likely due to bacteremia from instrumentation. She received intravenous fluids (IVF) and her central venous pressure (CVP) was resuscitated to 12, but she remained hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s. She was started on levophed, a vasopressor medication, and her lactate level is 0.3.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem, flagyl, and vancomycin) have been continued, along with blood cultures, urine cultures, and monitoring of blood pressures via arterial line and titrating levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
- The patient's CVP and urine output (UOP) are being monitored, with a goal of maintaining CVP at 8-12 and UOP above 30 cc/hr.
- The patient has choledocholithiasis/cholangitis,"

   # Hypotension: The patient
s MAPs have been maintained in the 60
s with
   levophed, however she was unable to be weaned.  Her hypotension is
   likely due to sepsis secondary to bacteremia after instrumentation
   during ERCP.  Lactate yesterday am was 0.3.  CVP has ranged recently 8
 14.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with meropenem, flagyl, and
   vancomycin as below

   - Continue to monitor her BPs via her A-line and continue levophed
   titrating to MAP > 60 as she is asymptomatic with SBPs in the 80s.
   Attempt to wean levophed as tolerated.  Follow mentation at lower MAPs
   as well as UOP with a goal of > 30 cc/hr.

   61F s/p gastric bypass and more recently, lap CCY, with
   choledocholithiasis, ESBL E coli UTI, and also ? pna, transferred from
   OSH for ERCP s/p stone removal complicated by sepsis.
   # Hypotension: The patient
s MAPs have been maintained in the 60
s with
   levophed, however she was unable to be weaned.  Her hypotension is
   likely due to sepsis secondary to bacteremia after instrumentation
   during ERCP.  Lactate yesterday am was 0.3.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with meropenem, flagyl, and
   vancomycin as below
   - F/u BCx, UCx
   - Continue to monitor her BPs via her A-line and continue levophed
   titrating to MAP > 65.   Attempt to wean levophed as tolerated.
   - Follow her CVP and given IV boluses to maintain it at 8-12.  Goal UOP
   of > 30cc/hr.
   # choledocholithiasis/cholangitis: pt's elevated Tbili, slightly
   elevated alk phos, and vague abd complaints at OSH c/w
   choledocholithiasis, for which pt underwent ERCP [**1-20**].
   - Manage hypotension as above
   - meropenem, given known UTI with ESBL E coli, flagyl for GI anaerobes,
   and vanc for gram positive coverage
   # Hypoxia: The patient has beeen weaned to RA.
   # ESBL E coli UTI: second possible source of infection, although time
   course more consistent with her recent ERCP, above, as source of
   sepsis. repeat UA showed on 1 WBC, neg leuk, neg nitrite
   - F/u  UCx
   - Continue meropenem as above.
   # Chronic pain: pt on numerous pain meds at home--fentanyl transdermal,
   oxycodone, ultram, as well as lidoderm and methocarbamol.
   - Will continue fentanyl and lidocaine patches, morphine boluses prn
   for pain prior to movement
   - Consider consulting the chronic pain service for better management of
   her chronic pain.
   # pancytopenia: based on records from [**Location (un) 1242**], this has been long
   standing, with WBC [**2-5**], Hct high 20s, and plts ~100, unresponsive to
   IVIG in the past, and has also received B12 supplementation as she is
   s/p gastric bypass, without apparent effect. Hct stable this am at 26,
   WBC increased to 7.1 and plt increased to 104.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female who has undergone gastric bypass surgery and recently had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with choledocholithiasis, ESBL E. coli UTI, and possible pneumonia. She was transferred from another hospital for an ERCP procedure, which was complicated by sepsis. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, choledocholithiasis/cholangitis, hypoxia, ESBL E. coli UTI, chronic pain, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and replete lytes. She has multiple lines and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, flagyl, and vancomycin. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 86/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to bacteremia after instrumentation during ERCP. Continuous monitoring of her vital signs and blood cultures is essential.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis. Close monitoring of her blood pressure and appropriate management with vasopressors, such as norepinephrine, are necessary.
3. Choledocholithiasis/cholangitis: The patient's elevated"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is indicated by low blood pressure and the need for vasopressor support. The source of infection is likely to be either the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or the genitourinary (GU) system. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover various potential pathogens.

Additionally, the patient has developed cholelithiasis after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, resulting in decompression of the common bile duct (CBD). The patient is expected to experience GI follow-up and may require adhesiolysis if there are any issues with the GI tract.

The patient is also dealing with chronic pain, making it difficult to manage with standard pain medications. Currently, the patient is on a prn morphine regimen. It is planned to resume the patient's home po pain regimen today.

Furthermore, the patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to hypoalbuminemia. Resuming a po diet is recommended to address this issue.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's condition can worsen if the infection is not effectively controlled and treated promptly.
2. Cholel"

   # Hypotension: The patient
s MAPs have been maintained in the 60
s with
   levophed, however she was unable to be weaned.  Her hypotension is
   likely due to sepsis secondary to bacteremia after instrumentation
   during ERCP.  Lactate yesterday am was 0.3.  CVP has ranged recently 8
 14.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with meropenem, flagyl, and
   vancomycin as below
   - F/u BCx, Ucx here and at the OSH.
   - Continue to monitor her BPs via her A-line and continue levophed
   titrating to MAP > 60 as she is asymptomatic with SBPs in the 80s.
   Attempt to wean levophed as tolerated.  Follow mentation at lower MAPs
   as well as UOP with a goal of > 30 cc/hr.
   - Follow her CVP and given IV boluses to maintain it at 8-12.
   # choledocholithiasis/cholangitis: pt's elevated Tbili, slightly
   elevated alk phos, and vague abd complaints at OSH c/w
   choledocholithiasis, for which pt underwent ERCP [**1-20**].
   - Manage hypotension as above

   and vanc for gram positive coverage
   # Hypoxia: The patient has beeen weaned to RA.
   # ESBL E coli UTI: second possible source of infection, although time
   course more consistent with her recent ERCP, above, as source of
   sepsis. repeat UA showed on 1 WBC, neg leuk, neg nitrite
   - F/u  UCx
   - Continue meropenem as above.
   # Chronic pain: pt on numerous pain meds at home--fentanyl transdermal,
   oxycodone, ultram, as well as lidoderm and methocarbamol.
   - Will continue fentanyl and lidocaine patches and add back the rest of
   her po home regimen as above
   # pancytopenia: based on records from [**Location (un) 1242**], this has been long
   standing, with WBC [**2-5**], Hct high 20s, and plts ~100, unresponsive to
   IVIG in the past, and has also received B12 supplementation as she is
   s/p gastric bypass, without apparent effect. Hct stable this am at

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy with choledocholithiasis, and an unknown primary neoplasm. She was transferred from OSH for an ERCP procedure, which was complicated by sepsis. The patient has been in the ICU since then and is currently being treated for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, ranging from mid-70s to low 90s, indicating possible sepsis secondary to bacteremia after the ERCP procedure. She is receiving levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
2. Choledocholithiasis/Cholangitis: The patient has elevated total bilirubin levels and slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, which are consistent with choledocholithiasis. She underwent an ERCP procedure, but the condition persists.
3. ESBL E Coli UTI: The patient has an infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli, which may be a source of infection. She is being treated with meropenem, flagyl, and vancomycin.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has long-standing pancytopenia with unresponsive WBC count, Hct, and platelets. Her counts are currently stable.

   61F s/p gastric bypass and more recently, lap CCY, with
   choledocholithiasis, ESBL E coli UTI, and also ? pna, transferred from
   OSH for ERCP s/p stone removal complicated by sepsis.
   # Hypotension: The patient was able to be weaned off levophed
   yesterday.  Her hypotension is likely due to sepsis secondary to
   bacteremia after instrumentation during ERCP.  CVP has ranged recently
   [**8-12**].
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with meropenem, flagyl, and
   vancomycin as below
   - F/u BCx, Ucx here and at the OSH.
   - Continue to monitor her BPs via her A-line and continue levophed
   titrating to MAP > 60 as she is asymptomatic with SBPs in the 80s.
   Follow mentation at lower MAPs as well as UOP with a goal of > 30
   cc/hr.
   - Follow her CVP and given IV boluses to maintain it at 8-12.
   # choledocholithiasis/cholangitis: pt's elevated Tbili, slightly
   elevated alk phos, and vague abd complaints at OSH c/w
   choledocholithiasis, for which pt underwent ERCP [**1-20**].
   - Manage hypotension as above
   - meropenem, given known UTI with ESBL E coli, flagyl for GI anaerobes,
   and vanc for gram positive coverage
   # ESBL E coli UTI: second possible source of infection, although time
   course more consistent with her recent ERCP, above, as source of
   sepsis. repeat UA showed on 1 WBC, neg leuk, neg nitrite.  Ucx from the
   OSH showed the E.coli was sensitive to imipenems and zosyn.
   - F/u  UCx
   - Continue meropenem as above.
   # Chronic pain: pt on numerous pain meds at home--fentanyl transdermal,
   oxycodone, ultram, as well as lidoderm and methocarbamol.
   - Will continue fentanyl and lidocaine patches and add back the rest of
   her po home regimen as above
   # pancytopenia: based on records from [**Location (un) 1242**], this has been long
   standing, with WBC [**2-5**], Hct high 20s, and plts ~100, unresponsive to
   IVIG in the past, and has also received B12 supplementation as she is
   s/p gastric bypass, without apparent effect. Hct stable this am at
   24.3, WBC at 5.5.
   - follow counts; continue folate
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine 200mcg daily
   # FEN: advance diet as tolerated to regular, replete lytes prn
   # Access: 22 PIV in L arm, Aline, and left subclavian central line
   # PPx: pneumoboots--no heparin [**2-2**] low plts at OSH; home ppi; bowel

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old female who underwent gastric bypass surgery and later had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CCY) with choledocholithiasis, along with an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that was complicated by sepsis. She has a history of ESBL E coli urinary tract infection (UTI), pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, and chronic pain. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/44 mmHg to 100/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. 

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds anteriorly, tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), 2+ edema in the arms and legs, and a small draining tract with a bag in the left upper quadrant (LUQ). Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and plans, including hypotension possibly due to sepsis secondary to bacteremia after instrumentation during ERCP, choledocholith"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with septic shock, likely due to an E.coli urinary tract infection. The patient has been weaned off pressors and is experiencing pain at a 7/10 intensity. They have multiple medical allergies and are currently on several medications including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, lidocaine patch, folate, Synthroid, Seroquel, fentanyl patch, Colace, and Atrovent.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 71/38 to 90/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 2,249 mL, output of 1,560 mL, and a positive balance of 689 mL since midnight. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.1 g/dL, platelet count of 65 K/uL, sodium level of 139 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. The patient has an elevated blood glucose level of 115 mg/dL. Imaging studies show evidence of choledocholithiasis, and the patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with decompression of the common bile duct.

The patient's current conditions include septic shock resolved, cholelithiasis treated with ERCP decompression, chronic pain, impaired skin integrity, and impaired gastrointestinal function. The plan includes narrowing antibiotic coverage to meropenem, monitoring for gastrointestinal follow-through and adhesions, managing chronic pain with standard pain medication regimen, addressing impaired skin integrity through resumed oral diet, and resuming home per oral regimen. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU with arterial and multi-lumen lines in place, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

The patient has since been weaned off pressors and continues to experience pain at a 7/10 intensity. Other medical conditions include cholelithiasis that required ERCP decompression of the CBD, chronic pain, and impaired skin integrity related to hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. Although the patient has been weaned off pressors, there is still a risk of developing further infections due to their compromised immune system.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in various organ functions, including kidney dysfunction (elevated creatinine and BUN levels), liver dysfunction (elevated liver enzymes), and electrolyte imbalances (low potassium and magnesium levels).
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of cholelithiasis, which can lead to complications such as cholecystitis or pancreatitis. Additionally, the patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of pressure ulcers and wound infections.
4. Chronic pain management: The patient's chronic pain is poorly controlled with standard pain medications, and they are currently on prn morphine. This may pose challenges in managing the patient's pain effectively and preventing potential"
