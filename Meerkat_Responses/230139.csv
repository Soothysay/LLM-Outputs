","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, referred for atrial fibrillation ablation. She underwent pulmonary vein isolation but experienced complications due to femoral artery puncture, resulting in a large hematoma.
- The patient is currently in sinus rhythm and is planned to restart coumadin and ASA, with monitoring on telemetry.
- The patient presented with hypovolemic hypotension, which improved after receiving 2 units of PRBC and 3L of IVF. However, her Hct decreased overnight, and she remains hypotensive with low UOP.
- The patient received 2 units of PRBC for acute blood loss anemia caused by the groin hematoma and small arterial puncture post-procedure.
- She will be monitored closely for any changes in her Hct, SBPs, and MAPs. A pressure dressing will remain in place.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, bladder spasms, GERD, and FEN. Her medications will be continued as per previous instructions.
- She is receiving IVFS for volume resuscitation and has multiple IV lines inserted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: Due to the large hematoma at the groin site and the holding of coumadin and aspirin, there is a risk of bleeding complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation may indicate ongoing bleeding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, who underwent pulmonary vein isolation complicated by a femoral artery puncture. She developed a large hematoma but maintained good pulses and stable blood pressure. Currently, she is in sinus rhythm and will restart coumadin tonight if hemodynamically stable. The patient has several medical conditions including hypotension, hypertension, bladder spasms, GERD, and fluid overload. She requires close monitoring and treatment for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient had a femoral artery puncture with a large hematoma formation. Although her pulses are stable and the hematoma is well-perfused, there is a risk of continued bleeding or hematoma expansion.
2. Infection: The presence of a pressure dressing over the groin hematoma increases the risk of infection, particularly if the dressing is not properly maintained.
3. Thrombosis: The patient's low hematocrit level (26.1%) indicates a risk of thrombus formation, which can lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Hypotension: The patient has required significant fluid resuscitation to maintain blood pressure in the 80s, suggesting potential ongoing hemodynamic instability.
5. Hypertension: Although currently hypotensive, the patient's history of hypertension should be monitored closely upon hemodynamic stabilization.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who underwent pulmonary vein isolation complicated by a femoral artery puncture. She is currently in sinus rhythm and is being monitored in the ICU.

24-hour events include hypotension with low MAPs, fluid responsiveness, and administration of 3 liters of IV fluid. Her hematocrit dropped from 31 to 26.1, and she received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The post-catheterization check revealed a largely stable hematoma.

The patient reports pain in the right groin but denies chest pain (CP) or shortness of breath (SOB). She has no known drug allergies.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/59 mmHg to 117/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula 2L. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR). 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,450 mL since midnight, with 1,000 mL of IV fluid given. Output includes 700 mL of urine and 230 mL of stool. The overall fluid balance is positive at 750 mL.

Respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. No ABG"

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) post percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI) for femoral artery puncture, resulting in a groin hematoma, arteriovenous (AV) fistula, and pseudoaneurysm formation. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit (Hct) level.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
- Heart rate (HR): 66 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal sinus rhythm (SR)
- Blood pressure (BP): 119/60 mmHg
- Respiratory rate (RR): 11 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 96% on nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute

The physical examination reveals a comfortable patient with no jugular venous distention (JVD), regular heart sounds with S1, S2, and a third heart sound (S3) at the left sternal border, clear lungs with no wheezing or crackles, soft and non-tender abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds, and warm, dry extremities with two large, resolving, partially indurated hematomas in the right groin.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old overweight male with a chief complaint of a right groin AV fistula and pseudoaneurysm. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and underwent imaging studies, including a right femoral ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA), which confirmed the presence of an AV fistula but ruled out ruptured peripheral bleed. The patient was consulted by a vascular surgeon who planned for likely surgery, possibly involving a vascular team including a vascular attending doctor. The patient's INR was held overnight due to a value of 1.7, and aspirin was deemed okay.

The patient denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or palpitations. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for better pain control.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation/flutter who underwent pulmonary vein isolation complicated by a femoral artery puncture. She has a large hematoma in her right groin but still has good pulses. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient had pulmonary vein isolation for atrial fibrillation/flutter, and currently, she is in sinus rhythm. She will need to restart coumadin after AV fistula management, continue taking ASA, monitor on tele, follow up with EP recommendations, and have a follow-up with EP Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5152**] in one week.

2. AV Fistula: This is a complication of the femoral artery puncture. The patient will need to be monitored for any complications related to the AV fistula.

3. Hypovolemic Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved with the transfusion of 2 units of PRBC and 3 liters of IVF. However, she is still hypotensive with low BP and poor UOP. It is recommended to recheck hematocrit, monitor SBPs and MAPs >60, and closely observe for any signs of bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation/flutter, who underwent pulmonary vein isolation complicated by femoral artery puncture. She has a large hematoma at the right groin site, complex pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous (AV) fistula. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic hypotension: The patient initially had low blood pressure and poor urine output, which indicates hypovolemia. She received 2 units of PRBC and 3 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) to address this issue. Close monitoring of the patient's hematocrit, blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is necessary to prevent recurrence.

2. Acute blood loss anemia/Groin hematoma: The patient developed a significant groin hematoma after arterial puncture during the procedure. She received 2 units of PRBC to manage acute blood loss. Continuous monitoring of the hematocrit level is essential to identify any further blood loss or anemia. The area of the hematoma should be closely observed for signs of expansion or infection.

3. AV Fistula complications: The presence of an AV fistula increases the risk of complications such as high-output cardiac failure, infection, and vascular insufficiency. Monitoring the patient's cardiovascular status and performing regular femoral ultrasound (US) or CT scan"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman who underwent pulmonary vein isolation for atrial fibrillation/flutter. However, the procedure was complicated by a femoral artery puncture, resulting in a large hematoma but preserved pulses. She has developed an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and hypovolemic hypotension, which has been treated with blood transfusions and intravenous fluids. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but requires close monitoring and management of her AV fistula. She also has acute blood loss anemia and a groin hematoma. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 119/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AV Fistula Complications: The patient has developed an AV fistula due to the femoral artery puncture. This can lead to complications such as bleeding, hematoma expansion, and ongoing blood loss.
2. Hypovolemic Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypovolemic hypotension, which has been partially corrected with blood transfusions and IV fluids. However, ongoing bleeding and fluid losses may necessitate further volume resuscitation.
3. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's blood loss during the procedure has resulted in acute blood loss anemia. This can cause symptoms such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. They have a chief complaint and are awaiting vascular surgery for an AV fistula repair tomorrow. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 120's systolic and a heart rate of 75 bpm. They are on hydromorphone (Dilaudid) for pain management. The patient has no known drug allergies. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted below.

Flow sheet data shows the patient's temperature ranging from 37.2°C to 98.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 116/61 mmHg to 129/79 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 65-75 bpm, respiratory rate ranging from 11-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 750 mL and output of 2,327 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,577 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but not on supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments. Lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose of 102 mg/dL. Other labs include PT/PTT/INR, differential count, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient has been on nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is discussed, and their disposition is mentioned.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to being in the ICU and receiving multiple treatments, making them more susceptible to infections.
2. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PT/PTT/INR levels indicate a bleeding risk, especially considering they are on anticoagulant therapy.
3. Fluid imbalance: The negative fluid balance suggests dehydration, which can lead to complications such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory issues: Although the patient is not on supplemental oxygen, there is a possibility of respiratory complications like pneumonia or atelectasis due to immobility and mechanical ventilation.
5. Neurological complications: The lack of neurologic assessment in the physical examination raises concerns about potential neurological issues that may arise during or after surgery.
6. Surgical site infection: As the patient is undergoing vascular surgery, there is a risk of surgical site infections, especially if proper sterile techniques are not followed.

It is important to monitor"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI) and has developed a groin hematoma, AV fistula, and pseudoaneurysm formation. She is currently hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit (Hct) after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient is in sinus rhythm and continues to be monitored for any evidence of recurrent peripheral vascular injury bleed. She will be monitored every 12 hours for changes in Hct levels and will undergo serial examinations. The patient is on dilaudid and ativan as needed for pain and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Groin Hematoma: The patient has a groin hematoma that developed after a femoral artery puncture. Close monitoring of Hct levels is necessary to ensure hemodynamic stability. There is a risk of ongoing bleeding or expansion of the hematoma.
2. AV Fistula/Pseudoaneurysm: The patient has an AV fistula and pseudoaneurysm formation. Surgical repair is planned in the morning, and the patient is holding coumadin due to upcoming surgery. There is a risk of bleeding during or after the surgical procedure.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is well-controlled but needs to be monitored closely, especially if the patient becomes unstable.
4. Bladder Spasms: The patient is experiencing bladder spasms"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent a puncture of the femoral artery for a procedure involving an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and pseudoaneurysm formation. She developed a groin hematoma and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) two days ago. Her hematocrit (Hct) has been stable since then. She is currently awaiting vascular surgery for repair of the AV fistula and pseudoaneurysm. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 120s systolic and a heart rate of 75 bpm. She is comfortable and not in distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure has been stable, but there is a risk of hemodynamic instability if she experiences significant blood loss during surgery or if the hematoma expands.
2. Infection: The patient has a groin hematoma which could potentially become infected, leading to an abscess or systemic infection.
3. Thrombosis: The patient's AV fistula and pseudoaneurysm may be at risk for thrombosis, especially if blood flow is compromised during surgery or if the patient develops clotting disorders.
4. Bleeding: The patient has already received 2 units of pRBCs and has had a stable Hct. However, there is still a risk of bleeding during"
