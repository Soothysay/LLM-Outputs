","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She presented with chills, malaise, new-onset atrial fibrillation (a-fib), and acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient's current condition includes acute systolic CHF exacerbation with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%, a-fib, and intravenous fluid (IVF)/packed red blood cell (pRBC) infusion. The chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema. The patient is on gentle diuresis with furosemide to achieve a negative fluid balance of -1L per 24 hours and is being closely monitored for urine output. The patient's coronary angiography reveals diffuse ST depressions in II, aVF, V3-V6, and ST elevation in aVR, with troponin not elevated. This suggests unlikely acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but possible demand ischemia. The patient is receiving IV heparin for new-onset a-fib, not ACS, and continues on clopidogrel, aspirin (ASA), metoprolol, and statin if taking orally. ACE inhibitors are being held due to acute renal failure. The patient's recent laboratory results include elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and plate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). She presented with symptoms of chills and malaise for three weeks, along with new-onset atrial fibrillation. The patient was found to have acute respiratory distress, hypoxia, and increased pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray. She was started on BiPAP and given Lasix for diuresis. The patient's condition improved with the administration of IV fluids and packed red blood cells (pRBCs). However, she continued to experience episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She was treated with IV metoprolol and eventually converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure with elevated creatinine and BUN levels. She also has anemia, which is likely due to chronic disease, and hypothyroidism. The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to respiratory alkalosis and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest acute decompensation of chronic heart failure. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease, but it needs to be closely monitored, especially considering her history of pernicious"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female with CAD s/p CABG, who presented with 3 wks of chills and
   malaise, with new atrial fibrillation in setting of likely pneumonia,
   resulting in acute CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # PUMP: Acute systolic CHF exacerbation (LVEF 25-30%) in the setting of
   a-fib and iVF/pRBC infusion. CXR notable for pulmonary edema.
   - gentle diuresis with furosemide to net goal of -1L per 24 hours
   - monitor urine output closely
   - continue metoprolol PO if taking PO
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with diffuse ST depressions in II, aVF, V3-V6 and
   ST elevation in aVR. Troponin not elevated here. CK uptrending.
   Unlikely ACS, likely demand ischemia.
   - continue IV heparin for new afib, not ACS
   - continue clopidogrel, ASA; metoprolol and statin if taking PO
   - will hold ACEi in the setting of acute renal failure
   - f/u on resting tracer imaging from stress MIBI yesterday
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with new onset a-fib, converted to NSR overnight.
   - metoprolol 50mg PO TID with holding parameters for blood pressure
   - continue IV heparin for now with goal PTT 60-80 for afib for now
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypoxia, respiratory difficulty: pna, afib with RVR, also pulmonary
   edema from CHF
   - BiPAP overnight; ABG as needed
   - if tired, consider intubation
   - chest CTA w contrast to r/o PE and evaluate chest
   .
   # Fever, malaise, coughs: concerning for pneumonia, or influenza, which
   might have triggered the atrial fibrillation.
   - sputum cx
   - rapid respiratory viral panel
   - check LDH, PCP smear
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] empiric levofloxacin IV; if no improvement, will broaden abx
   - f/u blood cx
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr on admission 1.5 with elevated BUN. In the
   setting of 3 wk of fever and poor po intake, this is most likely
   prerenal (FEBUN 26% < 50%). Patient is s/p IVF and 1 U PRBC with
   improvement in Cr to 1.3.
   - trend Cr
   - hold ACEi
   - mucomyst before CT
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with a history of pernicious anemia on b12 injections
   and additionally is on iron as an outpatient. On admission had Crit of
   23 got 1 unit of pRBCs. Unlikely hemolysing or acutely bleeding given
   elevated haptoglobin, normal bilirubin. Anemia labs with iron 11 (low),
   TIBC 229 (low), B12 > assay, folate > assay, haptoglobin 360
   (elevated), ferritin 1063 (high) transferrin 176 (elevated). Given
   markedly elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic disease.  Hct
   bumped appropriately after 1 unit of pRBCs.
   - monitor CBC closely
   - Cont outpatient iron, outpatient weekly b12 shots
   - Guaiac
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with chills and malaise. She has new-onset atrial fibrillation in the setting of likely pneumonia, resulting in acute congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure of 115/46 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on non-rebreather mask. The patient has been diagnosed with acute systolic heart failure exacerbation, likely due to atrial fibrillation and intravenous fluid/packed red blood cell infusion. The chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema. The patient is on gentle diuresis with furosemide, monitoring urine output closely, and continuing metoprolol if taking orally. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's rapid respiratory rate and bibasilar crackles indicate possible respiratory distress. If not managed properly, it can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's acute systolic heart failure exacerbation may progress to cardiogenic shock, characterized by hypotension, cool and clammy skin, altered mental status, and poor peripheral perfusion.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN suggest acute renal failure, which can worsen"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, fever, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU with complaints of shortness of breath and hypoxia. 

On admission, the patient had a temperature of 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure of 115/46 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient was given broad-spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin due to suspected infection.

The patient's condition deteriorated overnight, with increasing shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation despite being on BiPap. The decision was made to replace the BiPap with a face mask, which the patient tolerated well. The arterial line placement attempt was unsuccessful.

The patient's labs showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 322 K/uL, high blood glucose levels ranging from 166 to 214 mg/dL, elevated creatinine levels of 1.4 mg/dL, and low sodium levels at 18 mEq/L. Other lab results indicated abnormalities in potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Tropon"

   61 yo female with CAD s/p CABG, who presented with 3 wks of chills and
   malaise, with new atrial fibrillation in setting of likely pneumonia,
   resulting in acute CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # PUMP: Acute systolic CHF exacerbation (LVEF 25-30%) in the setting of
   a-fib and iVF/pRBC infusion. CXR notable for pulmonary edema.
   - gentle diuresis with furosemide to net goal of -1L per 24 hours
   - monitor urine output closely
   - continue metoprolol PO if taking PO
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with diffuse ST depressions in II, aVF, V3-V6 and
   ST elevation in aVR. Troponin not elevated here. CK uptrending.
   Unlikely ACS, likely demand ischemia.
   - continue IV heparin for new afib, not ACS
   - continue clopidogrel, ASA; metoprolol and statin if taking PO
   - will hold ACEi in the setting of acute renal failure
   - f/u on resting tracer imaging from stress MIBI yesterday
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with new onset a-fib, converted to NSR overnight.
   - metoprolol 50mg PO TID with holding parameters for blood pressure
   - continue IV heparin for now with goal PTT 60-80 for afib for now
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypoxia, respiratory difficulty: pna, afib with RVR, also pulmonary
   edema from CHF
   - BiPAP overnight; ABG as needed
   - if tired, consider intubation
   - chest CTA w contrast to r/o PE and evaluate chest
   .
   # Fever, malaise, coughs: concerning for pneumonia, or influenza, which
   might have triggered the atrial fibrillation.
   - sputum cx
   - rapid respiratory viral panel
   - check LDH, PCP smear
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] empiric levofloxacin IV; if no improvement, will broaden abx
   - f/u blood cx
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr on admission 1.5 with elevated BUN. In the
   setting of 3 wk of fever and poor po intake, this is most likely
   prerenal (FEBUN 26% < 50%). Patient is s/p IVF and 1 U PRBC with
   improvement in Cr to 1.3.
   - trend Cr
   - hold ACEi
   - mucomyst before CT
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with a history of pernicious anemia on b12 injections
   and additionally is on iron as an outpatient. On admission had Crit of
   23 got 1 unit of pRBCs. Unlikely hemolysing or acutely bleeding given
   elevated haptoglobin, normal bilirubin. Anemia labs with iron 11 (low),
   TIBC 229 (low), B12 > assay, folate > assay, haptoglobin 360
   (elevated), ferritin 1063 (high) transferrin 176 (elevated). Given
   markedly elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic disease.  Hct
   bumped appropriately after 1 unit of pRBCs.
   - monitor CBC closely
   - Cont outpatient iron, outpatient weekly b12 shots
   - Guaiac

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with symptoms of chills, malaise, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and acute exacerbation of heart failure. The patient has a low ejection fraction (25-30%) and was found to have pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. She has been receiving treatment for her conditions, including gentle diuresis with furosemide, monitoring urine output, and continuing medications such as metoprolol, clopidogrel, aspirin, statin, and levothyroxine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute systolic heart failure exacerbation due to atrial fibrillation and intravenous fluid/packed red blood cell infusion.
2. Diffuse ST depressions in II, aVF, V3-V6, and ST elevation in aVR, indicating possible coronary artery disease but not acute coronary syndrome. The patient is receiving IV heparin and continuing oral antiplatelet agents.
3. New-onset atrial fibrillation that was converted to normal sinus rhythm overnight. The patient is being monitored on telemetry and receiving IV heparin for anticoagulation.
4. Hypoxia and respiratory difficulty due to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with respiratory distress, and pulmonary edema from heart failure. The patient is on BiPAP and ABG as needed, with consideration for intubation if tired.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female with CAD s/p CABG, who presented with 3 wks of chills and
   malaise, with new atrial fibrillation in setting of likely pneumonia,
   resulting in acute CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # Likely pneumonia: Patient continues to be febrile.  Now on
   broad-spectrum antibiotics.  Flu negative.
   - f/u sputum and blood cx
   - ID consult regarding choice of antibiotics
   .
   # Respiratory difficulty:   Metabolic alkalosis currently, but patient
   likely tiring on BiPap. This is most likely [**1-18**] PNA with possible
   contributions from pulmonary edema [**1-18**] CHF, as evidenced by her small
   improvement with diuresis.  Chest CT preliminarily negative for PE.
   Repiratory feels that she should not be on Bipap for prolonged period
   of time, and patient would like to be intubated.
   - intubate
   - obtain a-line access for serial ABG
   - f/u final read chest CT
   # PUMP: Acute systolic CHF exacerbation (LVEF 25-30%) in the setting of
   a-fib and IVF/pRBC infusion. CXR notable for pulmonary edema.  Has
   improved modestly with gentle diuresis.
   - goal net even to 500 cc out over 24 hours.
   - monitor urine output closely
   - continue metoprolol
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with diffuse ST depressions in II, aVF, V3-V6 and
   ST elevation in aVR. Troponin not elevated here. CK uptrending.
   Unlikely ACS, likely demand ischemia.
   - continue IV heparin for new afib, not ACS
   - continue clopidogrel, ASA; metoprolol and statin if taking PO
   - will hold ACEi in the setting of acute renal failure
   - f/u on resting tracer imaging from stress MIBI yesterday
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient had 24 hour episode of afib, now in NSR.  She had a
   history of paroxysmal afib previously per patient, but PCP had chosen
   not to anticoagulate for unclear reasons.  She has also been having
   episodes of bigeminy overnight.
   - continue IV heparin for now with goal PTT 60-80 for afib for now
   - try to contact PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 570**] ([**Last Name (un) 7324**] [**Name (NI) 7325**], [**Street Address(2) 7326**])
   regarding decision not to anticoagulate
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue beta blocker (Metoprolol 50 TID)
   - replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr on admission 1.5 with elevated BUN. In the
   setting of 3 wk of fever and poor po intake, this is most likely
   prerenal (FEBUN 26%) .  Creatinine now stabilized at 1.4.
   - trend Cr
   - hold ACEi
   - gentle with diuresis
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with a history of pernicious anemia on b12 injections
   and additionally is on iron as an outpatient. On admission had Crit of
   23 got 1 unit of pRBCs. Unlikely hemolysing or acutely bleeding given
   elevated haptoglobin, normal bilirubin. Anemia labs with iron 11 (low),
   TIBC 229 (low), B12 > assay, folate > assay, haptoglobin 360
   (elevated), ferritin 1063 (high) transferrin 176 (elevated). Given
   markedly elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic disease.  Hct
   bumped appropriately after 1 unit of pRBCs.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with symptoms of chills and malaise, along with new-onset atrial fibrillation in the setting of likely pneumonia, resulting in acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient has been febrile and has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Likely pneumonia: The patient continues to be febrile and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Follow-up sputum and blood cultures are needed. An ID consult regarding the choice of antibiotics is also recommended.
2. Respiratory difficulty: The patient is experiencing respiratory alkalosis and high oxygen saturation. It is likely that the respiratory difficulty is due to pulmonary edema secondary to CHF. A chest CT has been done and is negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The respiratory team feels that the patient should not be on BiPap for an extended period of time, and the patient wishes to be intubated. Intubation and obtaining an arterial line for serial ABG should be considered. The final read chest CT should also be followed up.
3. PUMP: The patient has acute systolic CHF exacerbation with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%. The patient has improved modestly with gentle diuresis. The goal is to remove 500 cc of fluid over 24 hours. Monitoring"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with chills, malaise, and new-onset atrial fibrillation in the setting of likely pneumonia. She has been febrile and received broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to acute respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to pneumonia (PNA) with possible contributions from pulmonary edema due to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has also experienced acute systolic CHF exacerbation with an ejection fraction of 25-30%. She has shown a modest improvement with gentle diuresis.

The patient has a history of pernicious anemia and is on B12 injections and iron as an outpatient. On admission, she received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and has anemia likely due to anemia of chronic disease, as indicated by low iron levels, low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), elevated ferritin, and elevated transferrin.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with an elevated creatinine level on admission. This is most likely prerenal acute renal failure (ARF), given her fever and poor oral intake. Her renal function has stabilized at a creatinine level of 1.4.

The patient is on multiple medications, including beta-blockers, statins, ACE inhibitors, heparin, clopidogrel, aspirin, and metop"

   61 yo female with CAD s/p CABG, who presented with 3 wks of chills and
   malaise, with new atrial fibrillation in setting of likely pneumonia,
   resulting in acute CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # Likely pneumonia: Patient continues to be febrile.  Now on
   broad-spectrum antibiotics.  Flu negative.
   - f/u sputum and blood cx
   - ID consult regarding choice of antibiotics
   .
   # Respiratory difficulty:   Metabolic alkalosis currently, but patient
   likely tiring on BiPap. This is most likely [**1-18**] PNA with possible
   contributions from pulmonary edema [**1-18**] CHF, as evidenced by her small
   improvement with diuresis.  Chest CT preliminarily negative for PE.
   Repiratory feels that she should not be on Bipap for prolonged period
   of time, and patient would like to be intubated.
   - intubate
   - obtain a-line access for serial ABG
   - f/u final read chest CT
   # PUMP: Acute systolic CHF exacerbation (LVEF 25-30%) in the setting of
   a-fib and IVF/pRBC infusion. CXR notable for pulmonary edema.  Has
   improved modestly with gentle diuresis.
   - goal net even to 500 cc out over 24 hours.
   - monitor urine output closely
   - continue metoprolol
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with diffuse ST depressions in II, aVF, V3-V6 and
   ST elevation in aVR. Troponin not elevated here. CK uptrending.
   Unlikely ACS, likely demand ischemia.
   - continue IV heparin for new afib, not ACS
   - continue clopidogrel, ASA; metoprolol and statin if taking PO
   - will hold ACEi in the setting of acute renal failure
   - f/u on resting tracer imaging from stress MIBI yesterday
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient had 24 hour episode of afib, now in NSR.  She had a
   history of paroxysmal afib previously per patient, but PCP had chosen
   not to anticoagulate for unclear reasons.  She has also been having
   episodes of bigeminy overnight.
   - continue IV heparin for now with goal PTT 60-80 for afib for now
   - try to contact PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 570**] ([**Last Name (un) 7324**] [**Name (NI) 7325**], [**Street Address(2) 7326**])
   regarding decision not to anticoagulate
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue beta blocker (Metoprolol 50 TID)
   - replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr on admission 1.5 with elevated BUN. In the
   setting of 3 wk of fever and poor po intake, this is most likely
   prerenal (FEBUN 26%) .  Creatinine now stabilized at 1.4.
   - trend Cr
   - hold ACEi
   - gentle with diuresis
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with a history of pernicious anemia on b12 injections
   and additionally is on iron as an outpatient. On admission had Crit of
   23 got 1 unit of pRBCs. Unlikely hemolysing or acutely bleeding given
   elevated haptoglobin, normal bilirubin. Anemia labs with iron 11 (low),
   TIBC 229 (low), B12 > assay, folate > assay, haptoglobin 360
   (elevated), ferritin 1063 (high) transferrin 176 (elevated). Given
   markedly elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic disease.  Hct
   bumped appropriately after 1 unit of pRBCs.
   - monitor CBC closely
   - Cont outpatient iron, outpatient weekly b12 shots
   - Guaiac

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. There is a concern for ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) or pneumonia contributing to respiratory failure. Monitoring and adjusting ventilator settings will be crucial in managing this condition.

2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and is presenting with acute systolic heart failure exacerbation. Close monitoring of fluid balance and urine output is important to prevent further deterioration.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and a history of pernicious anemia. Renal function needs to be closely monitored, and diuresis should be used cautiously to avoid worsening renal failure.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has diffuse ST depressions and ST elevation in aVR. Although troponin levels are not elevated, it is important to continue anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy to prevent further ischemic events.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation should be continued, and efforts should be made to maintain sinus rhythm.

6. Anemia: The patient has a history of pernicious anemia and iron deficiency anemia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and ongoing supplementation with B12 and iron are necessary.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with symptoms of chills and malaise for three weeks. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia (PNA). The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation but experienced hypotension after receiving 80 mg of propofol. She did not respond to intravenous fluids (IVF) and was started on neosynephrine (norepinephrine). 

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors. She developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and renal infarcts as seen on the CT torso. The patient also has a history of pernicious anemia and is being treated with B12 injections and iron supplementation. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 78 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 101/46 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.8 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.0 g/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 26.1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 37 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 152 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 4.2 mEq/L, and glucose of 157 mg/dL. The platelet count is slightly low at 322 thousand/mm3.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and an infectious disease (ID) consult has been requested. She is also receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's medical history includes CAD, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and she has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). She is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) but had an episode of AFib overnight. 

Given the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, and potential bleeding events due to the use of anticoagulation therapy."

   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: concern for ARDS given acute-onset hypoxemia,
   bilateral infiltrates on chest CT, low CVP. Likely [**1-18**] PNA/sepsis, not
   likely to be [**1-18**] cardiogenic pulmonary edema anymore (CVP is low).
   Question of TRALI given blood transfusion on admission.
   - mechanical ventilation
   - f/u CXR
   - pulm consult
 bronchoscopy?
   - continue broad abx
   - f/u cultures
   - consider bactrim/steroids, if PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] pulmonary consult
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/FEVER: likely septic shock given fever, hypotension
   requiring pressors, decreased UOP. Possible source of infection is PNA.
   Pressure now stabilized.
   - try weaning levophed (MAP goal of >60)
   - fluids (small boluses) for CVP goal [**7-25**]
   .
   # Likely PNA: Patient continues to be febrile.  Now on broad-spectrum
   antibiotics.  Flu negative.
   - f/u sputum and blood cx
   - ID consult regarding choice of antibiotics and management
   .
   # PUMP: On admission, acute systolic CHF exacerbation (LVEF 25-30%) in
   the setting of a-fib and IVF/pRBC infusion. Now resolved with diuresis
   given low CVP.
   - monitor urine output closely
   - will restart metoprolol once weaned from levophed

   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG
   - continue clopidogrel, ASA; and statin
   - metoprolol on hold
   - will hold ACEi in the setting of acute renal failure

   # RHYTHM: Patient had 24 hour episode of afib, now in NSR.  She had a
   history of paroxysmal afib previously per patient, but PCP had chosen
   not to anticoagulate for unclear reasons.  She has also been having
   episodes of bigeminy overnight.
   - try to contact PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 570**] ([**Last Name (un) 7324**] [**Name (NI) 7325**], [**Street Address(2) 7326**])
   regarding decision not to anticoagulate
   - monitor on telemetry
   - holding metoprolol given levophed drip
   - replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr on admission 1.5 with elevated BUN. In the
   setting of 3 wk of fever and poor po intake, this is most likely
   prerenal (FEBUN 26%) .  Creatinine now stabilized around 1.3-1.4.
   - trend Cr
   - hold ACEi
   - gentle with diuresis

   # Anemia: Patient with a history of pernicious anemia on b12 injections
   and additionally is on iron as an outpatient. On admission had Crit of
   23 got 1 unit of pRBCs. Unlikely hemolysing or acutely bleeding given
   elevated haptoglobin, normal bilirubin. Anemia labs with iron 11 (low),
   TIBC 229 (low), B12 > assay, folate > assay, haptoglobin 360
   (elevated), ferritin 1063 (high) transferrin 176 (elevated). Given
   markedly elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic disease.  Hct
   bumped appropriately after 1 unit of pRBCs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who presented with chills, malaise, and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with heart failure, acute on chronic; anemia, chronic; renal failure, acute; and respiratory failure, acute. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with broad-spectrum antibiotics initiated due to suspected pneumonia (PNA). She is also on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off levophed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): Given the acute-onset hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on chest CT, and low CVP, there is concern for ARDS. The patient's respiratory failure may be related to a recent pneumonia.
2. TRALI (Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury): The patient received a blood transfusion on admission, which raises the question of TRALI given the bilateral infiltrates and hypoxemia.
3. Septic Shock: The patient's fever, hypotension requiring pressors, decreased urine output, and possible source of infection (PNA) suggest septic shock.
4. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's fever and respiratory failure indicate a likely diagnosis of pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further cultures and a pulmonary consult have been ordered.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and"
