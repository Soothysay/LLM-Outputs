   FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
   sitting semi-upright position. Available for comparison is a preceding
   similar study dated [**2126-8-1**]. There is no evidence of
   significant
   cardiac enlargement on this portable chest view. The pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. Thin plate atelectasis exists bilaterally
   on the bases,
   however, no evidence of acute infiltrates is present and the pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. No pneumothorax is identified in the
   apical
   area. In the upper abdominal area, bilateral pigtail catheters are
   overlying
   the renal areas indicating bilateral pelvic nephrostomy. These tubes
   were
   present earlier on examination of [**2126-8-1**].
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of new pneumothorax status post subclavian line
   placement.

   61F with MS, history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and
   bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension
   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event.  Less likely infectious possibilities include
   wounds/decubs but these appear clean, pneumonia, GI/C.diff.  Cultures
   checked but all after gent and zosyn.  Less likely cardiac
   ischemia/cardiogenic shock (though elevated enzymes more likely demand;
   no ECG changes), bleed (but low suspicion), pericardial
   effusion/tamponade (lower volts on ECG, though no reason for
   effusion/tamponade to be present), obstructive/PE (again less likely),
   adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia concern given use of etomidate but
   random [**Last Name (un) **] in 30s).  Overwhelmingly seems to be sepsis in etiology.
   - Antibiotics: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double
   coverage given strong possibility of pseudomonads, also vanc (no
   history of VRE known) for h/o MRSA.
   - f/u bloods and send urines from various sites.
   - f/u urology recs re: any other imaging for abscess etc.
   - C.diff if any diarrhea.
   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - Check TTE
   - PM Hct to r/o bleed
   - Trend lactates, CEs
   - Pressors: now on norepinephrine
   - consider PICC when afebrile
   - Add on cortisol and stim in AM.
   - Consider stress dose steroids if poor response to stim.
   # Leaking from G tube
   - G- tube to gravity
   - consider surgery
   - may need further imaging
   LEUKOCYTOSIS
   No evidence of new infection.
   - f/u cultures
   - check stool for cdiff
   ELEVATED INR
   Went from 1.1-1.4
   - check DIC labs
   # Nephrolithiasis s/p perc neph tubes.  ALso neurogenic bladder with
   foley.
   - f/u urology recs.
   - change indwelling foley given infection.
   # NSTEMI.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension.  No ischemic ECG
   changes. Troponin peaked at 0.53. Now trending down.
   - Continue to trend.
   - f/u TTE
   - No further intervention for now, consider statin
   # MS.  Painful UEs and now bedbound
   - IV pain meds for now given poor GI absorption
   - when taking POs, continue home pain, anxiety regimen.
   # Sacral decubs.
   - wound care consult.
   # Depression - home meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to postoperative hypotension and concern for septic shock. She has been experiencing fever, leukocytosis with bandemia, and tachycardia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has stage 3 decubitus ulcer on her back and stage 4 decubitus ulcer over her sacrum. Regular wound care is recommended.
2. Anxiety: The patient is bedbound and experiencing chronic pain, which may contribute to her anxiety. Home pain and anxiety regimen should be continued when she is taking oral medications.
3. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient has received 2 units of blood transfusion for low critical hemoglobin levels, indicating possible bleeding during surgery.
4. Chronic pain: The patient has painful upper extremities and is now bedbound. IV pain medications should be provided due to poor gastrointestinal absorption.
5. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's presentation with hypotension, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia suggests sepsis, possibly due to a urinary tract infection. Antibiotics have been"

   61F with MS, history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and
   bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension
   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event.  Less likely infectious possibilities include
   wounds/decubs but these appear clean, pneumonia, GI/C.diff.  Cultures
   checked but all after gent and zosyn.  Less likely cardiac
   ischemia/cardiogenic shock (though elevated enzymes more likely demand;
   no ECG changes), bleed (but low suspicion), pericardial
   effusion/tamponade (lower volts on ECG, though no reason for
   effusion/tamponade to be present), obstructive/PE (again less likely),
   adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia concern given use of etomidate but
   random [**Last Name (un) **] in 30s).  Overwhelmingly seems to be sepsis in etiology.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including impaired skin integrity, anxiety, anemia secondary to blood loss, chronic pain, sepsis without organ dysfunction, NSTEMI, elevated INR, leukocytosis, leaking from G-tube, nephrolithiasis, neurogenic bladder with Foley catheter, depression, and sacral decubitus ulcers.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 110/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on norepinephrine pressors. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated troponin level, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows bilateral pelvic nephrostomy tubes and no evidence of new pneumothorax. 

The patient has multiple pending cultures for blood and urine. 

The plan includes continuing antibiotics, monitoring bloods and sending urines, following urology recommendations, checking for possible abscess, monitoring decubitus ulcers, and considering a"

   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event.  Other infectious possibilities include
   wounds/decubs, pneumonia, GI/C.diff.  Cultures checked but all after
   gent and zosyn.  Other possibilities for hypotension include cardiac
   ischemia/cardiogenic shock (though elevated enzymes more likely demand;
   no ECG changes), bleed, pericardial effusion/tamponade (lower volts on
   ECG, though no reason for effusion/tamponade to be present),
   obstructive/PE (again less likely), adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia
   concern given use of etomidate).  Overwhelmingly seems to be sepsis in
   etiology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, anxiety, acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and chronic pain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septric Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to septic shock. The previous history of severe infections, intraoperative manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia, and suspicion of urinary tract infection leading to bacteremia suggest this as a possible cause. Other infectious possibilities include wounds/decubitus, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal/C. difficile infection. Cultures have been checked, but all after gentamicin and zosyn. Other possibilities for hypotension include cardiac ischemia/cardiogenic shock, bleed, pericardial effusion/tamponade, obstructive/pulmonary embolism, and adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia concern given use of etomidate).

2. Nephrolithiasis post Perc Neph Tubes: The patient has bilateral nephrolithiasis and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. Further urology recommendations are needed, and"

   vasculature is not congested. Thin plate atelectasis exists bilaterally
   on the bases,
   however, no evidence of acute infiltrates is present and the pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. No pneumothorax is identified in the
   apical
   area. In the upper abdominal area, bilateral pigtail catheters are
   overlying
   the renal areas indicating bilateral pelvic nephrostomy. These tubes
   were
   present earlier on examination of [**2126-8-1**].
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of new pneumothorax status post subclavian line
   placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, neurogenic bladder, and chronic pain. She presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient has a background of severe infections, including urosepsis, and bilateral nephrolithiasis. She has bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes in place.

The patient's current condition includes fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. Her blood culture is pending. She has leukocytosis with a high percentage of bands, elevated lactate levels, and an elevated INR. Her troponin levels are within normal range but have peaked.

The patient has multiple decubitus ulcers, pedal edema, and contractures of the upper extremities. She also has a leaking gastrostomy tube site. Her renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL.

The patient's recent interventions include radial arterial line placement, aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and weaning off vasopressor support. She is currently on norepinephrine. Her oxygen saturation is at 96% on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen.

The attending physician's assessment and plan include septic shock secondary to suspected urinary tract infection, likely due to the recent genitourinary manipulation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and the plan is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MS), urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient is currently on pressors, making good urine output, and mentally alert. She has a history of severe infections and intraoperative manipulation, along with fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) leading to septic shock. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septric Shock: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock, which is supported by her previous history of severe infections, intraoperative manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia. There is a high suspicion of a UTI leading to bacteremia, with Gram-negative rods (GNRs) being pseudomonas.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has leaks from her G-tube, which may lead to skin breakdown and potential infection.
3. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient had an NSTEMI likely due to demand ischemia during hypotension. However, there were no ischemic ECG changes, and troponin levels have peaked and are now trending down.

   # Septic shock.  Secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation.
   Urine cultures growing GNR, speciation pending, suspect pseudomonas.
   Blood cx remain pending. Patient off pressors and then restarted over
   night.  Cortisol wnl.  Echo wnl and enzymes. Foley has been changed.
   - Continue: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double coverage
   given strong possibility of pseudomonas
   - D/c vanc as cx growing GNR
   - f/u bloods and urine cx.
   - f/u urology recs
   - Check C.diff, not sent yet
   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - Wean pressors today and monitor hemodynamics
   - Place PICC once off pressors
   - Can add midodrine or given fluids if becomes hypotensive
   # Leaking from G tube: Per surgery, may be because bumper was not flush
   to skin. They advanced this and follow up G-tube study was
   nondiagnostic. No significant amount of contrast seen to be leaking
   around G-tube on my read.
   - F/u KUB and g-tube study final report.
   - f/u surgery recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue tube feeds
   - Continue advancing diet as tolerated
   LEUKOCYTOSIS: Secondary to urosepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - Stool for cdiff, patient has not yet stooled
   ELEVATED INR: Unclear etiology. Consider DIC. DIC labs normal, except
   D-dimer elevated. Platelets stable.

   # NSTEMI.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension.  No ischemic ECG
   changes. Troponin peaked at 0.53. Now trending down. No wall motion
   abnormalities on echo.
   - No further intervention for now, start statin
   - start aspirin after acute illness
   # MS.  Painful UEs and now bedbound

   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the

   to continue broad empiric antbx (gent/[**Last Name (un) **]) tailoring per cx results,
   given no GPs will dc Vanco.  Check gent level. Her bandemia has
   resolved but she continues to have a profound leukocytosis. She is
   clinically improving
We will check stool for c diff, decubiti do not
   appear infected. Consider CT. Will wean off levophed --pt with low
   baseline BP so will tolerate MAPS of 60 following mentation
   and UOP which has remained adequate. Suspect she may have autonomic
   dysregulation from MS and will consider adding midodrine.  In terms
   of recent demand ischemia, her TTE was unremarkable and we
   continue statin.  Hct now stable, no evidence of active bleeding.
   INR and Ptt mildly elevated, ? sepsis related, or nutritional, does not
   appear in DIC and plts remain stable. For MS we continue home meds,
   bowel reg, wound care c/s for decubiti.  In terms of g-tube, surgical

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 37.8°C (100.1°F), blood pressure 104/60 mmHg, heart rate 91 bpm, respiratory rate 9 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 99% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination: General appearance of alertness but appears fatigued, oriented, no acute distress. Chronically ill appearing with upper extremity contractures. Diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Slightly firm abdomen, reports being non-tender but appears uncomfortable to palpation, non-distended, bowel sounds present though hypoactive, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly. Back examination shows bilateral nephrostomy tubes in place. Extremities reveal pedal edema without clubbing or cyanosis, no movement of upper extremities (UEs) or lower extremities (Les).
- Labs: White blood cell count of 28.4 K/uL, hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 244 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 101 to 138 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L, lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L, INR of 1.3, and D-dimer level of 11032 ng/mL. Other lab results include elevated leukocyte count, normal cardiac enzymes, and elevated liver enzymes.
- Imaging: Gastrointestinal tube check port study shows hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of midline, likely from prior contrast in the bowel. A follow-up radiograph may be helpful. Echocardiogram reveals normal left atrium size, normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function with an ejection fraction of 60%. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal left ventricular filling pressure. No ventricular septal defect or significant valvular abnormalities are noted. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, and trivial mitral regurgitation is observed. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. No pericardial effusion is present. Chest X-ray shows stable cardiomedi"

","Summary:
The patient is a post-operative male admitted to the MICU due to hypotension and concerns for septic shock. The patient underwent a planned urologic procedure. The patient's medical history includes allergies to erythromycin, penicillins, latex, and a localized rash from ciprofloxacin. The patient is currently receiving various medications including norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and hydromorphone.

24-hour events:
- Transthoracic echo showed normal systolic function with an ejection fraction of 60%.
- Nutrition recommendations were given, including the administration of multivitamins, ascorbic acid, zinc sulfate, and vitamin A for a total of 10 days.
- Tube feeding recommendations were also provided, with the goal of starting tube feeds at 20 mL/hr and advancing as tolerated to reach the target rate of 80 mL/hr.
- A G-tube study was performed but was non-diagnostic, so a KUB (kidney-ureter-bladder) study is scheduled for the next day to check for contrast still present.
- The patient has GNR (gram-negative rod) in the urine.
- D-dimer, hapto, t-bili, and LDH levels are normal.
- The patient has a history of anxiety and chronic pain.

Lab results:
- WBC: 13.2 - 27.7 (slightly elevated)
- Hct: 38"

   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,

   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to post-operative hypotension and concern for septic shock.

The patient has been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), impaired skin integrity, anxiety, anemia secondary to blood loss, chronic pain, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing septic shock secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation. Urine cultures are growing Gram-negative rods (GNR), speciation pending, with a suspicion of pseudomonas. Blood cultures remain pending. The patient was off pressors and then restarted overnight. Cortisol levels are within normal range. The Foley catheter has been changed.

The plan of care includes continuing meropenem and gentamicin for double coverage due to the strong possibility of pseudomonas infection. Vancomycin has been discontinued as urine cultures growing GNR. Blood and urine cultures will be followed up. Urology recommendations will be followed up. A percutaneous insertion of central catheter (PICC) will be placed once the"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple comorbidities including MS, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient's current condition includes septic shock secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation. Urine cultures are growing GNR, speciation pending, suspecting pseudomonas. Blood cultures remain pending. 

The patient has been started on meropenem and gentamicin for double coverage due to the strong possibility of pseudomonas infection. Vancomycin has been discontinued as the cultures growing GNR. Blood and urine cultures are being followed up. Urology recommendations are being followed. A check for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is planned, although it has not been sent yet. Monitoring of decubitus is ongoing, and no active infection is currently evident. Pressors are being weaned today, and hemodynamics are being monitored. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) will be placed once the patient is off pressors. Midodrine or fluids can be added if the patient becomes hypotensive. 

The patient has a leaking gastrostomy (G) tube, which is expected due to the bumper not being flush to the skin. The G-tube study was nondiagnostic, with no significant amount of contrast"

   Contrast in the stomach. Hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of mid
   line
   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions, including mitral valve disease, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock secondary to urosepsis, possibly due to pseudomonas infection. She also has elevated leukocyte count, elevated D-dimer levels, and signs of potential myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection that leads to systemic inflammation and widespread organ dysfunction. Immediate treatment with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care is necessary to manage this complication.
2. Pseudomonas infection: The presence of GNR in the urine cultures suggests a possible pseudomonas infection. This type of infection can be challenging to treat and requires effective antibiotic therapy targeting pseudomonas organisms.
3. Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has shown signs of an acute myocardial infarction, specifically non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Prompt management is essential to minimize cardiac damage and prevent further complications.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to sacral decubitus, which increases the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including multiple sclerosis (MS), urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), and an indwelling Foley catheter. She presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient was diagnosed with septic shock secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation. Urine cultures grew pseudomonas, and she was started on meropenem. The patient's blood cultures are pending. She was also restarted on pressors and midodrine due to anasarca (swelling of body tissues) and low blood pressure. The patient has several other complications including pleural effusions (collapsed lungs), potential osteomyelitis (bone infection), renal and ureteral stones, skin erosion and possible severe decubitus ulcer (pressure sore), and elevated D-dimer levels indicating possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's condition is critical, and she will remain in the ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
2. Septic shock due to urosepsis.
3. Impaired skin integrity with possible severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis.
4. Pleural effusions causing lung collapse.
5. Renal and ureteral stones.
6. Anasarca (general"

   - In the AM: Pressors were weaned off in the AM.  Patients BP/MAP
   dropped.  She received 1.5L of NS with some response.  However, she was
   restarted on levo as she was anasarcic and sats dropped from 98% to 91%
   w/ fluids.  She was started on midodrine 5mg tid, to be uptitrated as
   tolerated.
   - KUB final read: no contrast material within the stomach identified.
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] does not think there is a leak, are monitoring overnight

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MS), urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient is currently in septic shock secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation, with urine cultures growing pseudomonas. Blood cultures remain pending.

The patient has been restarted on pressors and is being closely monitored for signs of end organ perfusion. She will continue to receive meropenem for at least a two-week course. Vancomycin has been restarted but can be discontinued given the urine culture results. Midodrine has been started at 5 mg three times a day, with the option to uptitrate as tolerated.

The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions, which are secondary to volume overload with lung collapse. She is currently satiating well on 1 liter of nasal cannula oxygen. Incentive spirometry has been recommended if tolerated. Lasix has been held due to the patient's presentation of shock, and further intravenous fluids have been withheld due to her being net in approximately 7 liters for the length of her stay.

There is a question of osteomyelitis, but this is unlikely given the downtrending white blood cell count. The wounds are being closely monitored, and probes to bone will be checked. The patient's right upper"

   Trace pericardial effusion, extensive subcutaneous edema and small

   etiology is recommended.
   6. Two hypodense liver lesions, stable since [**2126-1-27**]. As recommended
   previously an MRI may be helpful in further evaluation of the
   heterogeneous lesion in the right lobe. Multiple other liver lesions
   seen on [**2-8**] study are not well appreciated on the current study,
   likely due to timing of contrast.
   7. Skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum
   and
   coccyx to open air is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and
   underlying
   osteomyelitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have been admitted to the ICU and are experiencing significant health issues. The patient's condition is unstable, with frequent changes in vital signs and fluid balance. They have been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), acute myocardial infarction, impaired skin integrity, anxiety, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, chronic pain, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common cause of UTIs. If left untreated, it can lead to the progression of the infection and potential kidney damage.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe immune response to an infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.
3. Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones): The presence of multiple renal and ureteral stones can cause obstruction, pain, and urinary tract infections. If the stones cause any obstruction, it may lead to kidney damage or dysfunction.
4. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): The patient has been diagnosed with AMI, which is a heart attack. This condition can be life-threatening and may result in cardiac complications such as"

   Imaging: 1. Limited study as delayed images were not obtained and also
   secondary to hand injection due to lack of peripheral access.
   2. Definite intra-abdominal fluid collection. There is a small amount
   of
   intra-abdominal ascites.
   3. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lung collapse and
   pneumonia bilaterally.
   4. Multiple renal and ureteral stones which appears more fragmented
   than prior study. Status post nephrostomy tube placement. Multiple
   hyperdense
   material in the urinary bladder, likely stones, decreased since prior
   exam.
   Trace pericardial effusion, extensive subcutaneous edema and small
   amount of intra-abdominal ascites most compatible with anasarca.
   5. Subcutaneous gas in the right forearm subcutaneous tissues may be
   secondary to IV line placement. Clinical correlation for infectious
   etiology is recommended.
   6. Two hypodense liver lesions, stable since [**2126-1-27**]. As recommended
   previously an MRI may be helpful in further evaluation of the
   heterogeneous lesion in the right lobe. Multiple other liver lesions
   seen on [**2-8**] study are not well appreciated on the current study,
   likely due to timing of contrast.
   7. Skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum
   and
   coccyx to open air is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and
   underlying
   osteomyelitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient is currently diagnosed with septic shock secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation, as evidenced by urine cultures growing pseudomonas. She is also experiencing bl pleural effusions due to volume overload with lung collapse. Other medical conditions include MS, NSTEMI, impaired skin integrity, anxiety, chronic pain, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis and septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening.
2. Pneumonia: Bl pleural effusions may increase the risk of pneumonia due to compromised lung function.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the ultrasound ruled out DVT, the patient's immobility and contractures make her susceptible to developing DVT.
4. Kidney stones: The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis, and if the stones obstruct the urinary tract, it could lead to further complications such as kidney infection or kidney damage.
5. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient's history of NSTEMI increases her risk of experiencing another MI.
6. Impaired wound healing"
