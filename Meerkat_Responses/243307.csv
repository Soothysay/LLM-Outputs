   chemotherapy regimens admitted for episode of acute respiratory
   distress which was attributed to a mucous plug, then found to have
   bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion with cardiac
   tamponade physiology s/p multiple thoracenteses and pericardial drain.
   Also with persistent tachycardia.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus rhythm although this AM, reported HR in 180s that
   responded to metoprolol.  Unsure if SVT and the underlying rhythm. The
   patient was fluid challenged in the CCU and did not respond
   appropriately.  CTA negative for PE.  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to continued dyspnea
   and tachypnea [**2-5**] bilateral pleural effusions vs. component of pain vs.
   malignancy-driven response vs. cardiac tamponade. Recent TSH in [**7-/2118**]
   was 2.0.  Was given 5mg IV metop x2, then dilt 5mgx2 then started on
   Dilt drip, now with HR 110s.
   - monitor on telemetry

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who was admitted for acute respiratory distress. She had bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology, which were managed through thoracentesis and pericardial drain. The patient continues to have persistent tachycardia and is being monitored on telemetry. Her dyspnea is likely due to bilateral pleural effusions, and she has had some relief after right thoracentesis. Other concerns include anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypotension, which may be related to bleeding or chemotherapy suppression. The patient's pericardial effusion has been drained but shows signs of recurrence, with malignant cells present in the fluid. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia could indicate an underlying rhythm abnormality such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial fibrillation, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions can rapidly accumulate and cause respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring and daily chest X-rays are necessary to assess their progression. If they continue to accumulate rapidly, a pleurax catheter may be considered.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 29-30 to 25.5,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with mantle cell lymphoma who has been admitted to the BMT unit for shortness of breath due to a mucous plug. She had thoracentesis and was found to have pericardial effusion with malignant cells. The patient has been persistently tachycardic and has received fluid boluses without any improvement. She has been started on metoprolol and her CTA came back negative.

The patient's medical history includes allopurinol, pantoprazole, diltiazem, and colace. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), current temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 114 bpm (normal range: 86-182 bpm), blood pressure of 123/77 mmHg (with a range of 63-85 mmHg), respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (normal range: 19-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the chest, warm skin with no rash or jaundice, and normal neurologic function. Her lab results show a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, white blood cell count of 40 K/uL, sodium level of 139 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.5 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL, and platelet count of 85 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include anemia, tachycardia, mantle cell lymphoma, pericardial effusion, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's anemia is characterized by a recent drop in hemoglobin without an obvious source. Her tachycardia has improved but remains on continuous IV infusion of diltiazem. The oncology team will address the patient's mantle cell lymphoma, considering salvage chemotherapy. The patient has a pericardial effusion and is on cardiac monitoring. Thrombocytopenia has shown a slight drop recently, and a platelet transfusion is needed if the hemoglobin drops due to bleeding. The patient is critically ill."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with mantle cell lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU. She initially presented with shortness of breath due to a mucous plug and was found to have a pericardial effusion with malignant cells. The effusion was drained, but she continued to reaccumulate fluid, requiring multiple thoracentesis procedures. A left pleurovac was placed, and her pericardial drain was disconnected yesterday with minimal output over 24 hours. She remains persistently tachycardic despite fluid boluses and has been started on metoprolol. A negative cardiac troponin test was conducted. The patient has a history of chemotherapy and has been experiencing anemia, thrombocytopenia, and tachycardia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 123/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on multiple IV medications, including diltiazem and metoprolol, and has several lines inserted. Her lab results show abnormal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and glucose. The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently being managed in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of mantle cell lymphoma, who was admitted for acute respiratory distress. She had bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient underwent multiple thoracenteses and pericardial drain. She also experienced persistent tachycardia.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, but she had reported HR in the 180s that responded to metoprolol. The underlying rhythm is uncertain. The patient was fluid-challenged in the CCU and did not respond appropriately. A CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism. The most likely diagnosis is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial flutter with malignant pericardial effusion. The plan includes monitoring on telemetry, converting diltiazem drip to oral diltiazem, holding beta blocker due to hypotension, and maintaining adequate pain control.

2. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is likely secondary to bilateral pleural effusions, which are rapidly accumulating due to malignancy. She had some relief after right thoracentesis. Less likely causes include pulmonary embolism, as a recent CT angiogram was negative. The plan includes daily chest X-ray, monitoring oxygen saturation, maintaining head of bed >30 degrees, maintaining aspiration precautions,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who is admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress. She has had multiple chemotherapy regimens and is currently experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pericardial effusion.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is usually in the 90s, which indicates low blood pressure. This could lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs, such as the brain and kidneys, and may result in organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is persistently elevated, reaching up to 170 beats per minute. This could be due to various reasons, including cardiac tamponade, which has been resolved according to the echo results. Tachycardia can increase the workload on the heart and may eventually lead to heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Dyspnea: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing, likely secondary to bilateral pleural effusions. Rapid accumulation of pleural effusion can compromise lung function and impair gas exchange, leading to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 29-30 to 25.5. This could be due to bleeding into the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who has been admitted for acute respiratory distress. She had bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient underwent multiple thoracentesis and pericardial drain.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to persistent tachycardia. She experienced hypotension during sleep but was easily arousable with a pulsus paradox of around 10. She was started on diltiazem gastrointestinal (gtt) but became tachycardic to 170s. The diltiazem gtt was restarted, and her heart rate stabilized between 90s-110s with occasional aflutter in normal sinus rhythm this morning.

The patient received gemcitabine yesterday and completed radiation therapy. She has no known drug allergies. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.2°C (100.8°F)
- Tcurrent: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
- Heart rate: 96 bpm (94-157 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 90/60 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (17-30 bpm)
- Oxygen saturation: 95% on nasal cannula

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of mantle cell lymphoma, who presented with acute respiratory distress attributed to a mucous plug. She also had bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient underwent multiple thoracenteses and pericardial drain. She is currently experiencing persistent tachycardia and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains elevated despite treatment with metoprolol and diltiazem. This could indicate an underlying rhythm disturbance such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial flutter.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently in the 80s, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may be related to cardiac tamponade, fluid loss, or medication effects.

3. Dyspnea: The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to bilateral pleural effusions, which are rapidly accumulating. This could be due to malignancy or another underlying cause. The patient has had some relief after right thoracentesis but may require further intervention such as a pleurax catheter.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from baseline HCT 29-30s to 25.5. This could be a result of bleeding into the pericardium. Close monitoring and possible transfusion are necessary.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is chronically low and further decreased. Given her risk of bleeding and suppression of platelet production due to chemotherapy, close monitoring and platelet transfusion are recommended.

6. Pericardial effusion: Although the patient had a pericardial drain and the effusion was removed, a repeat echo showed a small to moderate pericardial effusion. Continued monitoring and consideration for a pericardial window or repeat echo are necessary.

7. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to cardiac tamponade, which has partially resolved but could recur. Gentle fluid resuscitation and close monitoring are recommended.

8. Mantle Cell Lymphoma: The patient's long-term plan for treatment involves allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) from a sibling donor with total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). However, given the extent of her disease and malignant effusion, a change in goals of care may be needed.

These are the potential medical complications based on the provided information."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of mantle cell lymphoma and recent diagnosis of malignant pericardial/pleural effusions. She is currently admitted to the ICU and experiencing several medical complications. 

24-hour events include attempts to wean off diltiazem (a medication used for heart rate control) resulting in an increased pulse rate of 130-170's and an irregular rhythm that appeared as atrial flutter, previously diagnosed as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient received gemcytobine (a chemotherapy agent) and 1 unit of blood transfusion.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), normal blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates stable vital signs with a slight variation in blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,215 mL (877 mL IV fluids, 150 mL PO), output of 1,145 mL (700 mL urine, 177 mL NG), and a balance of 1,070 mL.

The patient's blood work shows a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 194 mg/dL, low potassium level of 0.4 mg/dL, normal"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 60 y.o. F with h/o mantle cell lymphoma s/p multiple
   chemotherapy regimens admitted for episode of acute respiratory
   distress which was attributed to a mucous plug, then found to have
   bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion with cardiac
   tamponade physiology s/p multiple thoracenteses and pericardial drain.
   In the ICU for persistent tachycardia.
   # Tachycardia: The patient was fluid challenged in the CCU and did not
   respond appropriately.  CTA negative for PE. Most likely SVT or atrial
   flutter [**2-5**] nodal irritability with malignant pericardial effusion.
   Yesterday, weaned from dilt drip and stable on PO dilt
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO dilt
   - hold beta blocker [**2-5**] hypotension
   - adequate pain control
   # Dyspnea: Improved, with little 02 requirement.  Underlying cause
   bilateral pleural effusions that are rapidly accumulating [**2-5**]
   malignancy.  S/p R thoracentesis with relief.  Recent CTA was
   negative.
   - daily CXR
   - monitor O2 sat, supplemental 02 for O2 <90%
   - maintain HOB > 30 degrees
   - maintain aspiration precautions
   - continue albuterol nebs q6 hours
   - f/u IP recs: will reassess R pleural effusion with possibility of
   placing pleurax catheter if increasing dyspnea, increasing 02
   requirement.
   - monitor pleurax drainage
   #Anemia:  Baseline HCT 29-30s.  Currently stable 26-27.  Would be
   concerning for bleeding into pericardium if pt. hemodynamically
   unstable or if increasing signs of tapenade, but now stable.  Hemolysis
   labs negative.
   -HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -transfuse for HCT<25 or hd instability.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Chronic, now improving since Gemcitabine treatment.
   If any signs of bleeding or other end organ [**Last Name (LF) 4937**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] transfuse
   platelets to >50 otherwise will monitor.
   -Check PLT [**Hospital1 **]
   # Pericardial effusion: s/p pericardial drain that was removed Friday.
   On exam overnight, pulsus increasing to [**10-19**].  Bedside Echo did not
   show evidence of tamponade or acute change.  No hemodynamic change.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - monitor pulsus [**Hospital1 **] with doppler.
   - Patient unlikely to need pericardial window as effusions seem
   stable.  But will monitor closely for signs of tampenade
   - f/u lyme serology (although less likely considering cytology c/w
   lymphoma)
   # Hypotension: SBP usually in 90s per CCU.  On arrival pt SBP in 80s.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be [**2-5**] metoprolol dose that was given prior to arrival and started
   today.  Will tolerate MAP 60 at night if asymptomatic.
   - continue gentle fluid resucitation to keep MAP >65
   - bolus for UOP>30 cc/hour
   # Mantle Cell Lymphoma: Patient was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma
   in [**2114**].  She had one episode of radiation of an anterior mediastinal
   mass during this hospitaliztion. Long-range plan was for allogeneic SCT
   from sib donor with TLI, ATG. But given extent of disease and malignant
   effusion, XRT was stopped.
   - f/u BMT recs
   - continue ACV ppx
   # Nausea: Continue prn prochlorperazine, lorazepam
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue atorvastatin
   # FEN: oncology electrolye replacement scales / soft dysphagia diet
   with thin liquids as per speech and swallow recs
   # ACCESS: PIV and PICC
   # PPX: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots (given thrombocytopenia)

The patient underwent multiple thoracenteses and pericardial drain due to bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology. She is currently in the ICU for persistent tachycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia needs to be closely monitored, and further evaluation may be required to determine the underlying cause. Possible causes could include atrial flutter or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which are more likely given the patient's malignant pericardial effusion.

2. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is attributed to bilateral pleural effusions caused by malignancy. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and supplemental oxygen administration will be necessary. The possibility of placing a pleurax catheter to relieve increasing dyspnea and 02 requirement should be considered.

3. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit (HCT) is in the range of 29-30%, and currently, it is stable at 26-27%. Monitoring of hemolysis labs and transfusion for HCT <25 or hemodynamic instability would be appropriate. If there are signs of bleeding into the pericardium or increasing tamponade,"

   chemotherapy regimens admitted for episode of acute respiratory
   distress which was attributed to a mucous plug, then found to have
   bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion with cardiac
   tamponade physiology s/p multiple thoracenteses and pericardial drain.
   In the ICU for persistent tachycardia.
   # Tachycardia: The patient was fluid challenged in the CCU and did not
   respond appropriately.  CTA negative for PE. Most likely SVT or atrial
   flutter [**2-5**] nodal irritability with malignant pericardial effusion.
   Yesterday, weaned from dilt drip and stable on PO dilt
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO dilt 60mg q6h
   - hold beta blocker [**2-5**] hypotension
   - adequate pain control
   # Dyspnea: Improved, with little 02 requirement.  Underlying cause
   bilateral pleural effusions that are rapidly accumulating [**2-5**]
   malignancy.  S/p R thoracentesis with relief.  Recent CTA was
   negative.
   - daily CXR
   - monitor O2 sat, supplemental 02 for O2 <90%
   - maintain HOB > 30 degrees
   - maintain aspiration precautions
   - continue albuterol nebs q6 hours
   - R pleural effusion possibly enlarged on CXR this morning, but not
   rapidly accumulating.
   - monitor pleurax drainage
   #Anemia:  Baseline HCT 29-30s.  Currently stable 26-27.  Would be
   concerning for bleeding into pericardium if pt. hemodynamically
   unstable or if increasing signs of tapenade, but now stable.  Hemolysis
   labs negative. HCT drop today is likely dilutional/lab variation as all
   her counts went down.
   -HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -transfuse for HCT<25 or hd instability.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Chronic, now improving since Gemcitabine treatment.
   If any signs of bleeding or other end organ [**Last Name (LF) 4937**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] transfuse
   platelets to >50 otherwise will monitor.
   -Check PLT [**Hospital1 **]
   # Pericardial effusion: s/p pericardial drain that was removed Friday.
   On exam overnight, pulsus increasing to [**10-19**].  Bedside Echo did not
   show evidence of tamponade or acute change.  No hemodynamic change.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - monitor pulsus [**Hospital1 **] with doppler.
   - Patient unlikely to need pericardial window as effusions seem
   stable.  But will monitor closely for signs of tampenade
   -ECHO ordered for tomorrow per cardiology
   -lyme serologies show previous disease.
   # Hypotension: SBP usually in 90s per CCU.  On arrival pt SBP in 80s.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be [**2-5**] metoprolol dose that was given prior to arrival and started
   today.  Will tolerate MAP 60 at night if asymptomatic.
   - continue gentle fluid resucitation to keep MAP >65 (or >58 overnight)
   - bolus for UOP>30 cc/hour
   # Mantle Cell Lymphoma: Patient was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma
   in [**2114**].  She had one episode of radiation of an anterior mediastinal
   mass during this hospitaliztion. Long-range plan was for allogeneic SCT
   from sib donor with TLI, ATG. But given extent of disease and malignant
   effusion, XRT was stopped.
   - f/u BMT recs
   - continue ACV ppx
   # Nausea: Continue prn prochlorperazine, lorazepam
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue atorvastatin
   # FEN: oncology electrolye replacement scales / soft dysphagia diet
   with thin liquids as per speech and swallow recs
   # ACCESS: PIV and PICC

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with mantle cell lymphoma and pericardial/pleural malignant effusions currently in the ICU for SVT. She has been weaned off diltiazem (dilt gtt) and a bedside echo showed a small unchanged pericardial effusion with no tamponade physiology. She has a history of allergies to no known drugs, and she is currently receiving various medications including allopurinol, pantoprazole, diltiazem, acyclovir, and nystatin as needed. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 108 bpm (97-115 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 90/62 mmHg to 123/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (15-25 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus tachycardia as her heart rhythm. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,530 mL with 530 mL given as total intravenous fluids (IVF), 650 mL given as oral fluids (PO), and 248 mL given as total fluid by other means. The output includes 1,620 mL of urine output, -90 mL of negative balance in the drains, and -1,025 mL of negative balance in the NG tube/stool output.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with mantle cell lymphoma and malignant pericardial/pleural effusions. She is currently in the ICU for SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) and is being treated with diltiazem. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/62 to 123/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius. She has a small unchanged pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology. The patient's labs indicate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging shows small bilateral effusions, with the right effusion being slightly larger.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: Although the recent measurements did not show tamponade physiology, the patient has a history of malignant pericardial effusions which can lead to cardiac tamponade if the effusion worsens.
2. Respiratory Failure: The presence of pleural effusions and crackles at the right base may indicate compromised lung function, potentially leading to respiratory failure if the effusions continue to affect pulmonary mechanics.
3. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
