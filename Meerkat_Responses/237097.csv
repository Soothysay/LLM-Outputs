   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and chronic spinal stenosis. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to septic shock caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis.

The patient developed a new upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) while on the floor and received heparin drip for it. However, the patient subsequently developed gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with maroon stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT). The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was transferred back to the MICU.

The patient's current condition includes bronchial breath sounds at the left base with bilateral crackles at the bases, a resting tremor of hands, and distant heart sounds with regular rhythm. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated creatinine (Cr), low platelet count (Plt), elevated lactate acid level, low albumin level, and elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T).

Assessment and plan:
1. The patient has a history of C. diff colitis, which is clinically improving. The WBC count has fallen from a peak of 34 to 9. The abdomen is soft, non-t"

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 1830**] with the ICU team.  The note above
   reflects my input.  Although I entered a note in Metavision on [**2165-11-10**],
   I cannot locate it at present and this is a late entry.  Mr. [**Known lastname 1830**] is
   known to the MICU team and returns to the ICU with a GI bleed that was
   temporally associated with heparinization.  Clinical bleeding abated,
   and he was seen by GI, who is considering a flex sig.  Other issues as
   detailed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2391**] above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of c.diff colitis, septic shock, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the MICU for septic shock and developed gastrointestinal bleeding while on heparin therapy for a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is now stable with a hematocrit (HCT) of 28.0. 

The patient has a new left femoral vein clot and ongoing loose stools consistent with Clostridium difficile (C.diff) infection. His white blood cell count has decreased from 34 to 9. The patient's renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 0.7, and he is normotensive. 

He continues to have bronchial breath sounds at the left base with bilateral crackles at the bases. His vital signs are stable, and he is currently receiving IV fluids as needed to maintain urine output. 

The patient has multiple other medical issues including Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, back pain due to chronic spinal stenosis, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient experienced significant gastrointestinal bleeding while on heparin therapy, which required transfusion of PRBCs. It is important to monitor his hemodynamic status and hematoc"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, who presented to the floor with a new upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He subsequently developed gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) was stable overnight at 28.0%. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a likely new left femoral vein clot. The patient has multiple known drug allergies. He received metronidazole until 10:00 PM on 11/9/2015. The patient is currently on various ICU medications.

On review of systems, the patient's symptoms remain unchanged from admission. His vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate (HR) of 71 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 105/53 mmHg to 134/66 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97% on a face tent. The patient weighs 64.6 kg and stands at 70 inches tall. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,030 mL, with outputs of 227 mL in urine, 100 mL in NG tube drainage, and a negative balance of 803"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of C. diff colitis, septic shock, and Parkinson's disease. He was admitted to the MICU for septic shock and subsequently developed a new left femoral vein clot. The patient received heparin therapy for the DVT but subsequently developed GI bleeding with maroon stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was transferred back to the MICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/53 mmHg to 134/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on face tent. The patient is alert and oriented to place, year, and self but not to the month. Physical examination findings include distant heart sounds, bronchial breath sounds at the left base with bilateral crackles at the bases, and a resting tremor of the hands. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient has a history of C. diff colitis, which is improving with antibiotic therapy. He continues to have loose stools.
   - Taper antibiotics per GI recommendations.
   - Monitor for fever"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of C. diff colitis, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission for septic shock. The patient presented with bloody rectal bleeding and was found to have a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was started on heparin therapy, but developed a supratherapeutic level of anticoagulation and subsequently experienced bleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed to prevent further pulmonary embolism. The patient's condition has been stable since then.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including Parkinson's disease, myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and chronic spinal stenosis. He is currently on various medications such as amiodarone, statins, Sinemet, and Vicodin.

The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His neurological examination reveals a resting tremor of the left hand.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.6 thousand cells/microliter, elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and mildly decreased hemoglobin level of 9.3 g"

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of C. diff colitis, who presented to the MICU with septic shock and was transferred from the ED. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission. These include right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), left femoral vein clot, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), bronchial breath sounds at the left base, hypotension, and an elevated white blood cell count.

Medical Complications:
1. Right upper extremity DVT: The patient has a confirmed DVT in the right upper extremity. Heparin therapy was initiated, but due to the occurrence of GIB, heparin was discontinued. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement is recommended to prevent further embolization.
2. Left femoral vein clot: A CT abdomen/pelvis revealed a left femoral vein clot. An IVC filter placement is also considered for this clot, especially in the setting of GIB.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has experienced melena and maroon stools, indicating significant bleeding. Transfusions have been given, and the bleeding has stabilized. A flexible sigmoidoscopy is planned to further investigate the source of bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and unknown allergies. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to a complete occlusion of the left popliteal vein extending into the left common femoral vein. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed at 8 pm. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 64.6 kg. He has been NPO for a flexible sigmoidoscopy scheduled in the morning by GI. The patient's midline was leaking, so it was pulled by the IV nurse. A 22-gauge peripheral IV was lost, and a PICC line has been ordered urgently. The patient has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), a heart rate of 79 bpm with a sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 148/72 to 154/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and other medications through IV infusions.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 14.6 to 32.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level ranging from 9.3 to 28.9 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 49 to 26.1 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 65 to 167 mg/dL, and creatinine level ranging from 0.7 to 1.1 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has multiple medical complications including gastrointestinal bleed, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, Parkinson's disease, and pain control issues. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is dispositioned accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a complete occlusion of the left popliteal vein extending into the left common femoral vein, which increases the risk of a pulmonary embolism.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient already has a right upper extremity DVT, and there is a risk of further clot formation in other veins due to the IVC filter placement.
3. Infection: The presence of Clostridium difficile infection increases the risk of other infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction, which needs close monitoring and appropriate management.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed may lead to re-bleeding or persistent bleeding, requiring ongoing monitoring and intervention.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events and requires appropriate management to maintain sinus rhythm."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, chronic spinal stenosis, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient presented to the ICU with septic shock and was transferred from another unit with bronchial breath sounds at the left base, suggesting a possible left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient also had a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and received heparin therapy, which led to a bleeding episode.

The patient's current condition includes a left femoral vein clot, evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (melena and maroon stool), and a drop in hemoglobin levels. The patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure within normal range, heart rate within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 35.4°C (95.7°F).

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and decreased platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, and liver function tests are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal evidence of a left femoral vein clot.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has experienced melena and maroon stool, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been NPO (nothing by mouth) since yesterday morning"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old man with a complicated recent history who has been admitted to the MICU for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/67 mmHg to 154/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest and muscle wasting in the extremities.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including placement of an IVC filter due to failed anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), as well as being on prophylactic medications for stress ulcers and DVT prevention. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 49 K/uL. Other lab values show abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function, and liver enzymes.

The patient's medical complications that can arise include further bleeding due to the GI bleed, potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation, and possible complications related to the IVC filter placement. Additionally, the patient's critical illness puts him at risk for nosocomial infections and potential organ dysfunction.

It is important to closely monitor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has multiple known allergies, including sulfonamides, hydantoins, trimethadione/paramethadione, phenacemide, barbiturates, primidone, and gadolinium-containing agents. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 11/10/2165 and metronidazole on 11/12/2165.

Vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.7 C (98%), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.5 C (97.7%), heart rate (HR) of 87 bpm with a range of 75-97 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 127/59 mmHg to 163/85 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute with a range of 13-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 555 mL and output of 925 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 370 mL. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 64.6 kg. The patient is receiving various medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), which was started on 11/12/2165 at 12:08 AM.

Physical examination findings include undetermined peripheral vascular pulses, unassessed skin, and unassessed neurologic examination. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hb), decreased hematocrit (Hct), and elevated platelet count (Plt). Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, Parkinson's disease, and pain control issues. The patient has a history of hypertension. In the ICU, the patient has been receiving nutrition through Impact with Fiber at a rate of 35 mL/hour since 11/11/2165 at 07:00 PM. The patient has multiple lines, including an 18-gauge line placed on 11/9/2165, a 20-gauge line placed on 11/11/2165, and a PICC line placed on 11/11/2165. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is already diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and potential organ failure if not managed promptly.
2. Clostridium difficile infection: The presence of C"

   - typed and cross x 6 units
   - Consider tagged RBC vs angio if pt decompensates
   - On PPI IV BID
   - per GI, no urgent need for flex sig so will defer in setting of
   inflammation. Would not intervene at this time and increased risk in
   setting of inflammation
   # LLE DVT, RUE DVT: Pt had CT abd/pelvis with left femoral vein clot
   seen. US with DVT as above. In setting of GIB on heparin gtt, cannot
   anticoagulate so IVC filter placed
   # C.diff: clinically improving. WBC has fallen to 6.7 from peak of 34.
   Abdomen soft, NT/ND, but pt continues to have loose stools.
   - Off other abx: Continued on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for C.diff
   - monitor for fever, trend WBC
   # Volume status:
   Currently normotensive. Renal function stable at Cr of 0.7
   - IV fluids as needed to maintain urine output
   - may require lasix  if needs blood

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of C. diff colitis and septic shock who was admitted to the MICU. The patient has several ongoing medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. The patient had a recent lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and received heparin therapy. However, due to the occurrence of bleeding, heparin was discontinued. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed to prevent further pulmonary embolism.

2. The patient also has a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) and is on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce gastric acid production. He is also being monitored for signs of re-bleeding or transfusion requirements.

3. The patient has Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) and is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole. His white blood cell count has improved from a peak of 34 to 6.7, indicating a positive response to treatment. However, he still has loose stools.

4. The patient's volume status is stable with normal blood pressure and renal function. He is receiving intravenous fluids as needed to maintain urine output and may require Lasix if needed for blood transfusions.

5. The patient has bronchial breath sounds at the bases, which may be related to a hiatal hernia. Further evaluation is planned with an anterior"

   76y/o M with PMH C. diff colitis requiring MICU stay for septic shock
   with being transferred to MICU with BRBPR in the setting of heparin gtt
   for RUE DVT.
   # BRBPR - occured in the setting of heparin gtt with supratherapuetic
   level for RUE DVT. Pt with 5pt HCT drop over 2 days now stable.  GI and
   surgery following.
   - heparin gtt discontinued
   - no further maroon stool or need for transfusions
   - typed and cross x 6 units
   - Consider tagged RBC vs angio if pt decompensates
   - On PPI IV BID, despite data that can worsen C-diff. Now that c-diff
   has resolved, benefit for GI bleed likely outweighs risk.
   - per GI, no urgent need for flex sig so will defer in setting of
   inflammation. Would not intervene at this time and increased risk in
   setting of inflammation
   # LLE DVT, RUE DVT: Pt had CT abd/pelvis with left femoral vein clot
   seen. US with DVT as above. In setting of GIB on heparin gtt, cannot
   anticoagulate so IVC filter placed without complications
   # C.diff: clinically improving. WBC has fallen to 6.7 from peak of 34.
   Abdomen soft, NT/ND, but pt continues to have loose stools.
   - Off other abx: Continued on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for C.diff
   - monitor for fever, trend WBC
   # Volume status:
   Currently normotensive. Renal function stable at Cr of 0.7
   - IV fluids as needed to maintain urine output
   - may require lasix  if needs blood
   - Monitor VS, I/O, Cr
   - Keep I/O even to neg 500

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis and septic shock. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and received heparin for a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient developed bilateral bronchial breath sounds and had a drop in hemoglobin from 10.0 g/dL to 7.7 g/dL. His creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has decreased from a peak of 34 to 6.7.

Assessment and Plan:

1. BRBPR (blood-related bronchial breath sounds): Occurred in the setting of heparin gtt with supratherapeutic levels for RUE DVT. The patient's hemoglobin dropped by 5 points over 2 days. GI and surgery consultation is recommended. Discontinue heparin gtt, no further maroon stool or need for transfusions, type and crossmatch 6 units, consider tagged RBC vs angio if the patient decompensates.

2. LLE DVT, RUE DVT: The patient had a CT abdomen/pelvis with left femoral vein clot seen. Ultrasound with DVT confirmed. In the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding on heparin gtt, cannot anticoagulate, so"
