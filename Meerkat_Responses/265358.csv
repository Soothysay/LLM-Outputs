   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 EPIDUARL ABSCESS
   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of multiple
   psychiatric disorders, alcohol abuse, multiple falls, s/p VP shunt
   placement in [**2169**] for subdural hematoma and left hip replacement in
   [**4-20**] who presents from [**Doctor Last Name **] House s/p fall on [**2175-10-29**] with worsening
   left hip pain found to be septic from multiple epidural abscesses and L
   knee septic arthritis, s/p laminectomy and L knee washout.
   # Septic shock from epidural abscesses and L septic arthritis in knee:
   Now s/p neurosurgery and L knee washout, which hopefully addressed the
   sources.  BCx growing MSSA.  TTE did not show no obvious vegetations
   but was of suboptimal quality.  Per neurosurgey, shunt does not need to
   be tapped.  For MRI, please page [**Hospital1 12**] [**Pager number 9606**] to program shunt.
   - cont naficillin, d/c vanc/CTX
   - surveillence blood cultures
   - neuro checks q1 hr
   - consider TEE though pt needs long course of abx
   - no HSQ x 24 hrs, no ASA per Neurosurg
   - LSO brace ordered
   - Orthopedics and Neurosurgery following, appreciate recs
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   # Respiratory distress:  CXR shows mild pulm edema, no sig.
   infiltrate.  Left intubated due to long surgery.  No difficulties with
   ventilation.
   - cont. with minimal ventilatory support
   - propofol to assess neuro exam
   - extubate if no further surgery or MRI needed
   # Hyponatremia:  Initial urine electrolytes after IVFs revealed low
   urine sodium and mildly elevated urine osms and improved after IVFs
   suggesting hypovolemia hyponatremia.  Currently resolved.
   - monitor sodium
   - IVF hydration prn
   # Anemia: Baseline hematocrit 30-35. Normocytic. Likely related to bone
   marrow suppression from sepsis (low retic count) in setting of alcohol
   use and liver disease. Labs are notable for a low iron, elevated
   ferritin and low iron to TIBC ratio. She has no evidence of hemolysis.
   B12 and folate are normal.  She received 2 units of PRBCs on [**11-5**],
   another 1 unit on [**11-6**].
   - monitor hematocrit for now
   - guaiac all stools
   - consider iron supplements
   # Alcohol Abuse: History is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] primary physician is concerned
   for alcohol withdrawal.  Currently not tachycardic, hypertensive.
   - monitor vital signs
   - currently on propofol
   - continue home thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   # Depression/Anxiety/OCD:
   - continue fluoxetine 30 mg daily
   - hold lorazepam as on propofol
   - continue mirtazapine 30 mg QHS
   # Chronic Constipation:
   - continue colace, metamucil, senna
   # Hypertension:
   - hold all antihypertensives

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo female with EtOH abuse, VP shunt, frequent falls admitted with
   MSSA epidural abscess and left septic arthritis s/p laminectomy and
   knee washout
   1.       MSSA sepsis: hopefully improved source control following
   laminectomy/wash out. No pressor requirment.
   *Abx scaled to nafcillin based on sensitivities
 plan for 6 weeks of
   antibiotics.
   *Ortho/neurosurgery/ID following
   *Check surveillance blood cultures to see if bactermia has cleared
   negative from yesterday so far
   *Echo suboptimal, though has established nidus of infection elsewhere.
   ID recommendingTEE at some point to r/o endocarditis/abscess- this was
   unable to be done today because while the pt is  intubated, she cannot
   consent. She does not have a health care proxy available for consent
   *PICC once bacteremia cleared
   2.       Acute respiratory failure: intubated for surgery, remains on
   mechanical ventilation.
   *Propofol for sedation- will discontinue
   *Passed SBT
 plan to extubate today
   3.       EtOH abuse: no s/sx of EtOH withdrawal during 1st 3-4 days of
   hospitalization. Will monitor in ICU. Received banana bag
   4.       Depression/anxiety/OCD: resume psych meds
   5.      Chronic constipation:  Bowel regimen.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, VP shunt, frequent falls, admitted with MSSA epidural abscess and left septic arthritis following laminectomy and knee washout. She remains intubated due to the length of the procedure and potential need for re-operation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. MSSA sepsis: The patient has MSSA epidural abscess and left septic arthritis, and there is a risk of ongoing infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further respiratory complications.
3. EtOH withdrawal: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, and since she is now hospitalized, there is a possibility of withdrawal symptoms.
4. Endocarditis/abscess: The patient's healthcare provider recommends a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out endocarditis or abscess. If present, it would be a serious complication.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
7. Pressure injuries: The patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, VP shunt, and frequent falls. She was admitted with MSSA epidural abscess and left septic arthritis following a laminectomy and knee washout. The patient remains intubated due to the length of the procedure and potential need for re-operation. She has received blood products and antibiotics have been changed to nafcillin based on sensitivities. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA sepsis: The patient's MSSA infection may lead to sepsis if not properly controlled. Source control measures such as laminectomy/wash out have been performed, and long-term antibiotic therapy is planned.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. Extubation plans are pending the results of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out endocarditis or abscess.
3. EtOH withdrawal: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and is at risk for withdrawal symptoms. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal is essential.
4. Depression/anxiety/OCD: The patient has psychiatric conditions that require psychotropic medications. Resuming these medications is important for her mental well-being.
5. Chronic constipation: The patient may require a bowel regimen to manage chronic constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA sepsis: The patient has an ongoing infection with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), which can lead to sepsis. Source control measures such as the laminectomy/washout were performed, but the patient remains at risk for further complications.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
3. EtOH withdrawal: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and is currently at risk for withdrawal symptoms. Close monitoring in the ICU is necessary.
4. Endocarditis/abscess: The patient's MSSA infection may have spread to the heart, causing endocarditis or abscess formation. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to rule out these conditions.
5. Deep vein throm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, VP shunt, frequent falls, and admitted with MSSA epidural abscess and left septic arthritis following laminectomy and knee washout. The patient remains intubated due to the length of the procedure and potential need for re-operation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA Sepsis: The patient has an ongoing infection with MSSA, which can lead to sepsis if not properly controlled. The source control following laminectomy/washout is a positive step, but close monitoring and adherence to the antibiotic plan for 6 weeks are necessary.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and may require long-term support. Extubation plans are pending TEE results.
3. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and should be monitored for any signs of withdrawal while in the ICU.
4. Depression/Anxiety/OCD: The patient's psychiatric medications should be resumed while in the ICU.
5. Chronic Constipation: The patient has chronic constipation, and a bowel regimen should be implemented.
6. Potential Endocarditis/Abcess: Due to the presence of an echo suboptimal study and the recommendation by ID, a TEE at some point is needed to rule out endocarditis/abcess.

 BACTEREMIA
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 EPIDUARL ABSCESS
   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of multiple
   psychiatric disorders, alcohol abuse, multiple falls, s/p VP shunt
   placement in [**2169**] for subdural hematoma and left hip replacement in
   [**4-20**] who presents from [**Doctor Last Name **] House s/p fall on [**2175-10-29**] with worsening
   left hip pain found to be septic from multiple epidural abscesses and L
   knee septic arthritis, s/p laminectomy and L knee washout.
   # Septic shock from epidural abscesses and L septic arthritis in knee:
   Now s/p neurosurgery and L knee washout, which hopefully addressed the
   sources.  BCx growing MSSA.  TTE did not show no obvious vegetations
   but was of suboptimal quality.  For MRI, please page [**Hospital1 12**] [**Pager number 9606**] to
   program shunt.  Per neurosurgey, shunt does not need to be tapped.
   - cont naficillin, d/c vanc/CTX
   - surveillence blood cultures
   - neuro checks q1 hr
   - plan for TEE though pt needs long course of abx
   - no HSQ until [**11-9**], no ASA per Neurosurg
   - LSO brace when out of bed
   - Orthopedics and Neurosurgery following, appreciate recs
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   # Hyponatremia:  Initial urine electrolytes after IVFs revealed low
   urine sodium and mildly elevated urine osms and improved after IVFs
   suggesting hypovolemia hyponatremia.  Currently resolved.
   - monitor sodium
   - IVF hydration prn
   # Anemia: Baseline hematocrit 30-35. HCT currently stable after
   receiving 2 units of PRBCs on [**11-5**], another 1 unit on [**11-6**].  Likely
   related to OR loss and bone marrow suppression from sepsis (low retic
   count) in setting of alcohol use and liver disease. Labs are notable
   for a low iron, elevated ferritin and low iron to TIBC ratio. She has
   no evidence of hemolysis. B12 and folate are normal.
   - monitor hematocrit for now
   - guaiac all stools
   - consider iron supplements
   # Alcohol Abuse: History is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] primary physician is concerned
   for alcohol withdrawal.  Currently not tachycardic, hypertensive.
   - monitor vital signs
   - continue home thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   - SW
   # Depression/Anxiety/OCD:
   - continue fluoxetine 30 mg daily
   - continue mirtazapine 30 mg QHS

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of multiple psychiatric disorders, alcohol abuse, multiple falls, and previous surgery for subdural hematoma and hip replacement. She presented with worsening left hip pain after a fall and was found to have septic arthritis in her knee and multiple epidural abscesses. She underwent neurosurgery and knee washout to address the sources of infection. The patient is now on nafcillin, which is being continued, and all other antibiotics have been discontinued. Blood cultures are being monitored for surveillance. Neurological checks are being performed every hour. A plan for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is in place despite the need for a long course of antibiotics. Hip precautions are being taken, and the patient will be followed by orthopedics, neurosurgery, and infectious disease specialists. The patient's sodium levels have improved after intravenous fluids, indicating hypovolemia-related hyponatremia. Her hematocrit is stable after receiving blood transfusions and is likely related to OR loss and bone marrow suppression from sepsis. The patient's history of alcohol abuse may also contribute to her anemia. The patient's other medical issues include depression/anxiety/obsessive-compulsive disorder, chronic constipation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She is receiving appropriate prophylactic treatments and will be closely monitored in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of multiple
   psychiatric disorders, alcohol abuse, multiple falls, s/p VP shunt
   placement in [**2169**] for subdural hematoma and left hip replacement in
   [**4-20**] who presents from [**Doctor Last Name **] House s/p fall on [**2175-10-29**] with worsening
   left hip pain found to be septic from multiple epidural abscesses and L
   knee septic arthritis, s/p laminectomy and L knee washout.
   # Septic shock from epidural abscesses and L septic arthritis in knee:
   Now s/p neurosurgery and L knee washout, which hopefully addressed the
   sources.  BCx growing MSSA.  TTE did not show no obvious vegetations
   but was of suboptimal quality.  For MRI, please page [**Hospital1 12**] [**Pager number 9606**] to
   program shunt.  Per neurosurgey, shunt does not need to be tapped.

   # Anemia: Baseline hematocrit 30-35. HCT currently stable after
   receiving 2 units of PRBCs on [**11-5**], another 1 unit on [**11-6**].  Likely
   related to OR loss and bone marrow suppression from sepsis (low retic
   count) in setting of alcohol use and liver disease. Labs are notable
   for a low iron, elevated ferritin and low iron to TIBC ratio. She has
   no evidence of hemolysis. B12 and folate are normal.
   - monitor hematocrit for now
   - guaiac all stools
   - consider iron supplements
   # Alcohol Abuse: History is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] primary physician is concerned
   for alcohol withdrawal.  Currently not tachycardic, hypertensive.
   - monitor vital signs
   - continue home thiamine, folate, multivitamins

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of multiple psychiatric disorders, alcohol abuse, multiple falls, VP shunt placement in 2169 for subdural hematoma, and left hip replacement in 4-20. The patient presents from Doctor Last Name House after falling on 2175-10-29 with worsening left hip pain. She was found to be septic from multiple epidural abscesses and L knee septic arthritis, and she underwent laminectomy and L knee washout.

The patient's current condition includes septic shock from epidural abscesses and L septic arthritis in the knee, for which she has already undergone neurosurgery and L knee washout. Blood cultures are growing MSSA (Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus). A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not show any obvious vegetations but was of suboptimal quality. An MRI is planned to program shunt, as per neurosurgery, and the shunt does not need to be tapped.

The patient's medical team is monitoring her closely with neuro checks every 1 hour, surveillance blood cultures, and plans for TEE though the patient needs a long course of antibiotics. She is not allowed to have heparinized saline until 11-9, and she should wear a long-sleeved orthopedic brace when out of bed. The patient's condition also includes hy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple psychiatric disorders, alcohol abuse, multiple falls, and a history of VP shunt placement for subdural hematoma and left hip replacement. She presents with worsening left hip pain and septic shock from multiple epidural abscesses and L knee septic arthritis. She underwent neurosurgery and L knee washout. The patient is currently on nafcillin for 6 weeks, surveillance blood cultures, and TEE not urgent. She will not receive SC heparin until 11/9, no ASA per Neurosurg, and is advised to wear an LSO brace when out of bed. The patient's hematocrit is stable after receiving 2 units of PRBCs on 11/5 and another unit on 11/6. Anemia is likely related to OR loss and bone marrow suppression from sepsis in the setting of alcohol use and liver disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, VP shunt, frequent falls, and admitted with MSSA epidural abscess and left septic arthritis following laminectomy and knee washout. The patient was extubated yesterday. She is being treated for MSSA sepsis with appropriate source control measures post laminectomy/washout. The patient is currently stable without the need for pressors, and antibiotics have been prescribed for 6 weeks. A TEE is recommended by ID to rule out endocarditis/abscess, and a PICC line will be placed once bacteremia clears. The patient is also being monitored for EtOH withdrawal, depression/anxiety/obsessive-compulsive disorder, chronic constipation, and has received a PT consult.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA infection: The patient has MSSA epidural abscess and left septic arthritis. The infection needs to be closely monitored, and the source control measures should be effective to prevent further complications.
2. Endocarditis: There is a recommendation for a TEE to rule out endocarditis/abscess. This suggests that there is a concern for the possibility of endocarditis, which can have serious consequences if not treated promptly.
3. EtOH withdrawal: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, and withdrawal symptoms may occur during hospitalization. Close monitoring is necessary to manage any potential complications associated with Et"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, VP shunt, frequent falls, admitted with MSSA epidural abscess and left septic arthritis following laminectomy and knee washout. She has been extubated and is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), current temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 96 bpm with a range of 83-104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/59 mmHg to 178/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 11-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received various infusions and medications including nafcillin, ranitidine, morphine sulfate, senna, metamucil, mirtazapine, risperidone, docusate, thiamine, multivitamins, folate, calcium, fluoxetine, and vitamins. She is also on a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 175 K/uL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, blood glucose of 155 mg/dL, and other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, differential white blood cell count, lactic acid level, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

Imaging and microbiology results are negative since November 6th. The patient has been weaned off pressors and her source control has been improved following laminectomy and knee washout. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main issues include MSSA sepsis, EtOH abuse, depression/anxiety/OCD, chronic constipation, and the need for a PT consult. Antibiotics have been scaled to nafcillin based on sensitivities, and the plan is for 6 weeks of antibiotics. The patient's bacteremia has cleared, and she will require a TEE at some point to rule out endocarditis/abscess. Once bacteremia clears, a PICC line will be placed. The patient will continue to be monitored in the ICU for EtOH withdrawal, and psych medications will be resumed. The patient will also be started on a bowel regimen for chronic constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA sepsis: The patient still requires close monitoring for any signs of sepsis recurrence or complications related to MSSA infection.
2. EtOH withdrawal: Since the patient has a history of EtOH abuse, there is a"

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, VP shunt, and frequent falls. She was admitted with MSSA epidural abscess and left septic arthritis after undergoing laminectomy and knee washout. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated for mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. She is also on antibiotics for MSSA sepsis, with plans for 6 weeks of treatment. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 126/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. She has trace edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and hematocrit levels, while other values are within normal range. Imaging and microbiology findings are unremarkable. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of MSSA sepsis, acute respiratory failure, EtOH abuse, depression/anxiety/obsessive-compulsive disorder, and chronic constipation. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.
