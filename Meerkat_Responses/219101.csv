   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate to 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Morphine PRN: chest pain
   - Will continue to try and obtain EKG
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload. Received IV Lasix on transfer with good UOP, but remains
   fluid overloaded this AM.
   - Repeat Lasix 40mg IV x 1 this AM, goal -1L today
   - O2 by NC
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Increase Lisinopril 5mg daily
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation,
   f/u additional recs
   - F/U folate, b12, TSH level this AM
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID if
   tolerating PO
   #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved. No
   focal neurologic deficits on admission.
   #. FEN: Cardiac/diabetic, MVI
   #. Access: Patient transferred with right subclavian line in place.
   Unable to pull line secondary to patient agitation, but will attempt to
   place PIV

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, diabetes, and EtOH abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and NSTEMI. The patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization were concerning for unstable angina, and his serum troponin level on admission was elevated. Cardiac catheterization showed occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts, but the procedure was aborted due to the patient's agitation. A new stent was placed in the SVG-OM1, and he is awaiting further evaluation and treatment.

The patient has been experiencing agitation and confusion since his hospitalization. He has been pulling at his lines and attempting to get out of bed. His primary process appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium, possibly exacerbated by benzodiazepine withdrawal. He is currently on Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN for agitation, and a psych consult has been recommended.

The patient also has a history of AF, persistent tachycardia, and diuresis. He is on metoprolol tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID to manage his heart rate. He has a history of diabetes and is being managed with NPH and insulin sliding scale. Additionally, he has a history of EtOH abuse and may be experiencing"

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid marginal branch (SVG-OM1) and left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD) grafts. However, the procedure was aborted due to patient agitation. A new stent was placed in the SVG-OM1, and the patient is awaiting further cardiac catheterization on January 24th. 

The patient is currently chest pain-free with negative cardiac enzymes but refusing electrocardiogram (EKG). His current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, heparin, and morphine for chest pain. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/66 to 161/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. He is receiving O2 by NC.

The patient's physical examination reveals normal peripheral vascular pulses and skin not"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.

   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Will continue to try and obtain EKG
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload.
   - Lasix 40mg IV x 1, repeat PRN
   - O2 by NC
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when

   - Increase Lisinopril 5mg daily
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   #. HTN:

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, and EtOH abuse, admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and NSTEMI. The patient's cardiac catheterization was aborted due to agitation, and he has a new stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is currently awaiting catheterization on 1-24 for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA occlusion. The patient's primary processes include agitation, confusion, and potential components of dementia/delirium, as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization were concerning for unstable angina, and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to Hospital1 was 0.04. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 & LIMA-LAD grafts, but the patient's agitation during the procedure prevented completion of cardiac catheterization. The patient has a new stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded, and he is awaiting catheterization on 1-24 for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA occlusion. The patient is currently chest pain-free with negative CE, but refusing EKG.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.

   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation,
   f/u additional recs
   - F/U folate, b12, TSH level this AM

   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.

   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, diabetes, EtOH abuse, and previous ICU admission for respiratory failure and NSTEMI. He was transferred to the CCU after an aborted cardiac catheterization due to agitation. The patient has been experiencing agitation, confusion, and refusing all PO medications. He has a new stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting catheterization for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA occlusion. The patient also has acute-on-chronic systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 51% as assessed by nuclear imaging. He demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement, and there is evidence of fluid overload. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are concerning for unstable angina, and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are available from OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [Hospital1 19] was 0.04. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented completion of cardiac catheterization. The patient is awaiting catheterization on [1-24] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain-free, with negative CE"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate to 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Morphine PRN: chest pain
   - Will continue to try and obtain EKG
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload. Received IV Lasix on transfer with good UOP, but remains
   fluid overloaded this AM.
   - TTE today
   - Repeat Lasix 40mg IV x 1 this AM, as patient is incontinent will
   gauge fluid status by exam
   - PM electrolytes & replete PRN
   - O2 by NC
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Increase Lisinopril 5mg daily
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation,
   f/u additional recs
   - F/U folate, b12, TSH level this AM
   - CXR, U/A to rule out typical infectious causes
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). The aortic valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular cavity
   enlargement with moderate global hypokinesis. Mild aortic valve
   stenosis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   became tachypneic to 40's with pC02 of 59 and HCO of 35 (pH 7.37),
   became progressively somnolent. Was intubated. Unclear what the cause
   of his disorders are: he is retaining CO2, likely because he is so
   tachypneic as to only ventillate his deadspace, he could also have a
   PNA that affects his gas exchange. he is hyperbicarbic because he was
   aggressively diuresed. The intubation will also facilitate a workup of
   his other severe medical problems - AMS, CAB and possible PNA
   - fent/versed sedation
   - abgs for now as ALine could not be placed
   - VAP bundle
   - may need to involve renal for help with understanding metabolic
   disorder
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Psych evaluated and agreed with haldol
   for restraints. Normal folate/b12/tsh. As of [**1-24**], infectious etiology
   still likely with suggestive UA and CXR
   - Psych consult, following
   - haldol for chemical restraints after off sedation
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He was awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. He was chest pain free without EKG changes as of [**1-24**].
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate to 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Morphine PRN: chest pain
   - may be able to go for cath while intubated/sedated
    .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis
   - O2 by NC
   -Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when tolerating PO
   -Lisinopril 5mg daily
   .
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID if
   tolerating PO
   .
    #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   .
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved.
   Possibly rigid on left arm
   #. FEN: Cardiac/diabetic, MVI
   #. Access: Patient transferred with right subclavian line in place.
   Unable to pull line secondary to patient agitation, but will attempt to
   place PIV
s and will discontinue the subclavian line when PIV
s placed

   CT chest [**2182-1-24**]: Bilateral non-hemorrhagic layering pleural effusions,
   larger on the right side are associated with adjacent lung atelectasis.
   Assymetry between the consolidation in the left lower lobe and the
   pleural effusions suggest the presence of atelectasis and pneumonia.
   Mild smooth interlobular septal thickening associated with ground glass
   opacities in the upper lobe is consistent with mild interstitial
   pulmonary edema. There are few scattered calcified granulomas.
   CT head [**2182-1-24**]: 5mm age-indeterminate infarct in the anterior limb of
   the right internal capsule. Recommend MR for further characterization.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improved this
   AM.
   - F/u Sputum culture & blood cultures from [**2182-1-24**]
   - IV Vancomycin, day 3
   - Cefepime, day 3
   - Frequent ABG
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At
   home, however, his wife states that he is not confused, but does
   exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been attempting
   to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully oriented despite
   repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process appears to be
   agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. Patient also
   takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component of
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic work-up as an inpatient. CT
   head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age,
   so neurology was consulted.  Infection and CVA may be complicating
   already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - F/U Neurology recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, and EtOH abuse.
- He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and NSTEMI.
- The patient's cardiac catheterization was aborted due to agitation.
- He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38C (100.4F), heart rate 86 bpm, blood pressure 88/42 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 97%, and central venous pressure 13 mmHg.
- The patient has a CT chest showing left lower lobe pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.
- He was started on vancomycin and cefepime empirically, but his urine culture was negative.
- The patient also has a CT head showing a small lacunar infarct in the anterior limb of the right internal capsule.
- The patient's mental status has been fluctuating with agitation and confusion.
- He has a history of dementia, delirium, and possible benzodiazepine withdrawal.
- The patient's cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts.
- He received a stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded.
- The patient's ejection fraction is 30-35% according to a TTE on 1/23.
- He has a history of EtOH abuse and possible withdrawal.
- The patient's other medical conditions include HLD, HTN, GERD, anxiety/depression, and a history of TIA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's CT chest shows left lower lobe pneumonia. This increases the risk of complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which can lead to respiratory distress and compromise oxygenation.
3. Stroke: The patient's CT head shows a small lacunar infarct in the anterior limb of the right internal capsule. This increases the risk of further neurological complications, such as hemiparesis or speech difficulties.
4. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and agitation suggest delirium, which can be caused by various factors including infections, metabolic disturbances, and withdrawal from benzodiazepines.
5. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of CABG, NSTEMI, and occluded grafts. These cardiac issues increase the risk of further myocardial ischemia, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
6. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and possible withdrawal. This increases the risk of severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens.
7. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia, which increases the risk of functional decline, falls, and difficulty with activities of daily living."

   CT chest [**2182-1-24**]: Bilateral non-hemorrhagic layering pleural effusions,
   larger on the right side are associated with adjacent lung atelectasis.
   Assymetry between the consolidation in the left lower lobe and the
   pleural effusions suggest the presence of atelectasis and pneumonia.
   Mild smooth interlobular septal thickening associated with ground glass
   opacities in the upper lobe is consistent with mild interstitial
   pulmonary edema. There are few scattered calcified granulomas.
   CT head [**2182-1-24**]: 5mm age-indeterminate infarct in the anterior limb of
   the right internal capsule. Recommend MR for further characterization.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improved this
   AM.
   - F/u Sputum culture & blood cultures from [**2182-1-24**]
   - IV Vancomycin, day 3
   - Cefepime, day 3
   - Frequent ABG
   - Will hold off on weaning vent until patient returns from
   catheterization
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At
   home, however, his wife states that he is not confused, but does
   exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been attempting
   to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully oriented despite
   repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process appears to be
   agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. Patient also
   takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component of
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic work-up as an inpatient. CT
   head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age,
   so neurology was consulted.  Infection and CVA may be complicating
   already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - Haldol for chemical restraints once extubated
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He was awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. He was chest pain free without EKG changes as of [**1-24**].

   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), alcohol abuse, and chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30-35%). He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization but was aborted due to agitation. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, acute kidney injury (creatinine 1.2), hypokalemia (K+ 3.8), and hyponatremia (Na+ 135). He also has a small lacunar infarct in the anterior limb of the right internal capsule. The patient is currently receiving IV antibiotics, diuretics, and has had several blood cultures drawn. 

The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with episodes of agitation and confusion. This may be due to infection, dementia, delirium, or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Neurology and psychiatry consultations have been requested. 

The patient's blood pressure is currently low and requires pressors. He is also hypoxic and requires supplemental oxygen. His fluid status is concerning for fluid overload. 

The patient's disposition is pending extubation and further work-up."

   CT chest [**2182-1-24**]: Bilateral non-hemorrhagic layering pleural effusions,
   larger on the right side are associated with adjacent lung atelectasis.
   Assymetry between the consolidation in the left lower lobe and the
   pleural effusions suggest the presence of atelectasis and pneumonia.
   Mild smooth interlobular septal thickening associated with ground glass
   opacities in the upper lobe is consistent with mild interstitial
   pulmonary edema. There are few scattered calcified granulomas.
   CT head [**2182-1-24**]: 5mm age-indeterminate infarct in the anterior limb of
   the right internal capsule. Recommend MR for further characterization.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improved this
   AM.
   - F/u Sputum culture & blood cultures from [**2182-1-24**]
   - IV Vancomycin, day 3
   - Cefepime, day 3
   - Frequent ABG
   - Will hold off on weaning vent until patient returns from
   catheterization
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At
   home, however, his wife states that he is not confused, but does
   exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been attempting
   to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully oriented despite
   repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process appears to be
   agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. Patient also
   takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component of
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic work-up as an inpatient. CT
   head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age,
   so neurology was consulted.  Infection and CVA may be complicating
   already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - Haldol for chemical restraints once extubated
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He was awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. He was chest pain free without EKG changes as of [**1-24**].

   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis

   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN when extubated

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), alcohol abuse, and previous transient ischemic attack (TIA). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's current conditions include pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, agitation, confusion, dementia, atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction (EF) of 51%, rhythm disturbance, alcohol withdrawal, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), anxiety/depression, and short-term memory impairments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions. This can lead to worsening respiratory status and potential sepsis.
2. Agitation and Mental Status Changes: The patient's agitation and confusion may be due to various factors such as infection, dementia, delirium, or benzodiazepine withdrawal. These can increase the risk of falls, self-extubation, and other adverse events.
3. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 51%. This can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors for hypotension"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and hypotension. 

The patient has been diagnosed with a left lower lobe pneumonia, mild interstitial pulmonary edema, and large right and small left pleural effusions. The radiologist recommends further investigation with an MRI to assess for any age-indeterminate infarct in the anterior limb of the right internal capsule.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, set at a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 290, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/42 mmHg to 162/77 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's central venous pressure is 13 mmHg, with a fluid balance of 2,539 mL total input and 1,375 mL total output.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 247 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.6 g/dL, blood glucose of 197 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 227 K/uL. Other laboratory values are within normal range.

The patient's arterial line was placed on January 24th at 02:09 PM, and the multi-lumen central line was placed on January 24th at 04:22 PM. The patient is receiving midazolam, norepinephrine, and fentanyl infusions. Heparin sodium for prophylaxis was started on January 24th at 09:22 PM.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization. The patient's age-indeterminate infarct may also require further evaluation and management. Additionally, the patient's electrolyte imbalances and elevated blood glucose levels should be monitored and managed accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. Patient returned to
   cath on [**1-25**] and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a
   PCWP of 15 . On [**1-25**], patient has MAPs of roughly 50, on levophed
   implying shock.
   - central venous sat to better describe shock state
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate  37.5mg TID when bp
s tolerate
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving
   vis-a-vis CO2 but less so O2.
   - F/u blood cultures from [**2182-1-24**]
   - IV Vancomycin, day 4
   - Cefepime, day 4
   - Frequent ABG
   - RISBI today to assess potential for wean
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. On [**1-25**], he remained
   pressor dependent.
   - titrate pressors to MAP > 60
   - lasix, fluids for even fluid balance today
   Chronic managment
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg TID when bp
s tolerate
   - Lisinopril PO 5mg daily when tolerating PO
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes
   # CVA's, Hx of TIA
    Patient's cardiac catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was
   refractory to significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and
   [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has been confused and agitated since
   his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that
   he is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta).They
   suggest carotid dopplers. ction and CVA may be complicating already
   complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - carotids
   - f/u lipids, a1c
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - Haldol for chemical restraints once extubated
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm. Prior report of AF was
   likely telemetry static.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID when bp
s tolerate
   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN when extubated
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
   #. HTN:  Currently hypotensive, requiring pressors.
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily when bp
s tolerate
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID when bp
s tolerate
   .
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned on [**1-26**].
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - will start BB when bp

   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 5,  Cefepime, day 5
   - Frequent ABG
   - attempt extubation today
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was being weaned.
   - continue to wean pressor as tolerated
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - will start Metoprolol Tartrate and Lisinopril when BP can tolerate
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, who was transferred to the CCU after an aborted cardiac catheterization due to agitation. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and NSTEMI. The patient has undergone several procedures including cardiac catheterization, right heart catheterization, and placement of a PROMUS stent. He has been intubated since January 23rd and is currently on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 40%. His vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 97/40 mmHg and heart rate of 84 bpm. The patient's respiratory status has improved with a RSBI of 56. He has small pleural effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis. His labs show elevated troponin levels and abnormal kidney function. The patient has multiple comorbidities including NSTEMI/CAD, respiratory distress with complex metabolic disturbance, acute on chronic systolic CHF, agitation/mmental status changes/CVA's/TIA, and EtOH abuse. He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and cardiovascular drugs. The plan is to continue weaning off sedation and attempt extubation today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been intubated for a prolonged period, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned off [**1-26**]. Has since been extubated.
   Pressures have been stable enough to start beta blocker.
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - start metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].  Pt extubated on [**2182-1-27**]. Put on BiPAP.
   Tolerating well with good oxygenation. Some CO2 retention however, pH
   relatively normal. [**Month (only) 51**] have been retaining chronically but appears
   compensated. Will continue to follow with ABGs. Afebrile, some
   coughing, no production. Lungs with bibasilar crackles.
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 6,  Cefepime, day 6 (plan for 8 day
   course)
   - Frequent ABG
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   .
   #. Sinus Tachycardia: Unclear etiology. Had fluid challenge and pRBCs
   yesterday without improvement. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to volume status. CVP
   checked and is low at 4-7. No evidence of PE, on prophylaxis. No
   evidence of active ischemia. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to beta blocker
   withdrawal vs agitation/delirium.
   - attempt to minimize delirium as below
   - start metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - will need NG tube for medications
   - cont tele
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU after an aborted cardiac catheterization due to agitation following an out-of-hospital stay (OSH) for respiratory failure and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but was later extubated and placed on non-invasive positive airway pressure (BiPAP). He has been weaned off levophed infusion and is currently stable with good oxygenation. The patient's cardiac catheterization showed occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the right omohydaloid artery (SVG-OM1) and left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD) grafts. A PROMUS stent was placed in the LIMA-LAD graft.

The patient has been on various medications including aspirin, atorvastatin, and clopidogrel for cardiac prophylaxis, as well as metoprolol for blood pressure control. He has also been receiving intravenous (IV) antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned off [**1-26**]. Has since been extubated
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - consider starting low dose beta blocker today
 will discuss with
   attending
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].  Pt extubated on [**2182-1-27**]. Put on BiPAP.
   Tolerating well with good oxygenation. Some CO2 retention however, pH
   relatively normal. [**Month (only) 51**] have been retaining chronically but appears
   compensated. Will continue to follow with ABGs.
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 6,  Cefepime, day 6
   - Frequent ABG
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - haldol prn
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was being weaned.
   - off levophed
   - consider transfusion
 no evidence of hypoperfusion
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - will start Metoprolol Tartrate and Lisinopril when BP can tolerate
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   #. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm/sinus tachycardia. Prior
   report of AF was likely telemetry static.
   - On telemetry
   - will start BB when BP can tolerate
   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale

   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN when extubated per CIWA scale

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after an aborted cardiac catheterization due to agitation following an out-of-hospital (OSH) admission for respiratory failure and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient has multiple medical complications that need attention. These include:

1. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization suggest unstable angina, and his enzymes were indicative of NSTEMI. However, no electrocardiograms (EKGs) from the OSH are available. Serum troponin on admission to the hospital showed a level of 0.04. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the omohydaloid artery (SVG-OM1) and left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD) grafts. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of a PROMUS stent in the LIMA. His right heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 15.

2. Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: The patient was intubated on [date] due to worsening respiratory status and low-grade fever."

   Final Report
   INDICATION: 82-year-old man with NSTEMI, respiratory failure and status
   post
   placement of NG tube. Evaluate for position of NG tube.
   COMPARISON: Multiple priors, most recent portable AP chest radiograph
   [**2182-1-28**].
   TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest radiograph.
   FINDINGS: Comparison is made to portable AP chest radiograph obtained
   earlier
   today. Gastric tube is noted to extend beyond the level of the
   diaphragm with
   tip coiled within the stomach. Otherwise, no interval change noted from
   most
   recent portable AP chest radiograph obtained earlier today.
   ECG: 12:30am - Normal sinus rhythm, no ST changes.  No evidence of RV
   strain.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned off [**1-26**]. Has since been extubated.
   Pressures have been stable enough to start beta blocker.
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - start metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].  Pt extubated on [**2182-1-27**]. Put on BiPAP.
   Tolerating well with good oxygenation. Some CO2 retention however, pH
   relatively normal. [**Month (only) 51**] have been retaining chronically but appears
   compensated. Will continue to follow with ABGs. Afebrile, some
   coughing, no production. Lungs with bibasilar crackles.
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 6,  Cefepime, day 6 (plan for 8 day
   course)
   - Frequent ABG
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   .
   #. Sinus Tachycardia: Unclear etiology. Had fluid challenge and pRBCs
   yesterday without improvement. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to volume status. CVP
   checked and is low at 4-7. No evidence of PE, on prophylaxis. No
   evidence of active ischemia. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to beta blocker
   withdrawal vs agitation/delirium.
   - attempt to minimize delirium as below
   - start metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - will need NG tube for medications
   - cont tele
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient had an aborted cardiac catheterization due to agitation, and his right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 15.

The patient's recent events include the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) and initiation of tube feeds, starting metoprolol at 25mg and increasing it to 37.5mg at midnight, and using senna/colace to promote bowel movement due to unclear last bowel movement. The patient also experienced bloody sputum once, but an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain.

The patient has multiple medical complications including NSTEMI/CAD, respiratory distress with complex metabolic disturbance, sinus tachycardia, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation/mental status changes/CVA's/TIA, diabetes mellitus, ethanol abuse, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient is also being treated for anxiety/depression, anxiety, and depression.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of"

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Uptitrate metoprolol tartrate (currently at 37.5 [**Hospital1 7**]) to 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 7, cefepime day 7 (plan for 8 day course)
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - CXR - ?new consolidation, fluid status
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - uptitrate metoprolol
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge if continues
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - consider carotid u/s per neuro recs
   - f/u hemoglobin A1C
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - 4 bed rail restraint, 2 ext restraints
 pulling at lines
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves
   .
   #. HLD:
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, diabetes mellitus, and EtOH abuse. He presented to the hospital with NSTEMI and required intubation due to respiratory failure. He also has pneumonia, which was treated with antibiotics. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and had a PROMUS stent placed in his LIMA graft. He is currently chest pain-free and off NTG drip.

The patient's respiratory status improved, and he was extubated, but he still requires supplemental oxygen. His ABG results are stable, indicating chronic hypercapnia. The patient's CVP is low, but it is difficult to interpret without additional information. There is a concern for sinus tachycardia, which could be due to various causes such as hypotension, PE, beta-blocker withdrawal, hypoxia, fever, anxiety, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart failure, or chronic pulmonary disease. The patient's recent echo showed maintained systolic function.

The patient also has a history of acute on chronic systolic CHF with an EF of 30-35%. His Right heart cath showed a PCWP of 15. He is currently stable with no signs of hypoperfusion. The patient's mental status changes may be related to agitation, delirium, dementia, CVA's, or TIA. His CT scan showed a small lacunar infarct, and neurology was consulted."

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Uptitrate metoprolol tartrate (currently at 37.5 [**Hospital1 7**]) to 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 7, cefepime day 7 (plan for 8 day course)
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - CXR - ?new consolidation, fluid status
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - uptitrate metoprolol
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge if continues
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - consider carotid u/s per neuro recs
   - f/u hemoglobin A1C
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - 4 bed rail restraint, 2 ext restraints
 pulling at lines
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves
   .
   #. HLD:
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 (SVG-OM1) and left internal mammary artery (LIMA)-left anterior descending (LAD) grafts. The patient then had a PROMUS stent placed in his LIMA.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient likely had NSTEMI given the EKG findings. Serum troponin at admission was 0.04. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient received aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and uptitrated metoprolol tartrate.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on [1-23] in the context of worsening respiratory status and low-grade fever. A CT scan of the chest showed left lower lobe pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions. The patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime with a plan for an 8-day course. The patient"

   borderline LAD, poor R wave progression, Q waves III, V1, no ST
   deviation, T weave inversion I, aVL, flattened Ts V1, V5, V6
   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Uptitrate metoprolol tartrate (currently at 37.5 [**Hospital1 7**])
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 7, cefepime day 7 (plan for 8 day course)
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - consider further diuresis if
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - uptitrate metoprolol 37.5mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and had a Promus stent placed in his left internal mammary artery (LIMA). He is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and metoprolol.

Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient likely had a NSTEMI given his EKG findings and elevated troponin levels. He underwent cardiac catheterization which showed occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the omohydarlic artery (SVG-OM1) and LIMA-LAD grafts. A Promus stent was placed in his LIMA.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions as seen on the chest CT. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime, but his ABG results indicate hypercarbia. The patient is currently oxygenating well on BiPAP and is being weaned off supplemental oxygen.

3. Sinus tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 94 bpm"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and alcohol abuse. He presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the omohyoidal artery and left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery grafts. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization but was very agitated during the procedure, leading to its abortion. The patient then had a Promus stent placed in the left internal mammary artery. 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, sinus tachycardia, and NSTEMI. He is currently being treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and uptitrating metoprolol. The patient also has pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions, for which he is receiving vancomycin and cefepime. He has been extubated and is tolerating BiPAP well. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and ongoing coronary artery disease. There is a risk of further ischemic events or myocardial infarction due to the underlying condition.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure with pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions. There is a risk of worsening respiratory status and"

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 8, cefepime day 8 (plan for 8 day course)
   - d/c antibiotics after todays dose
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - discontinue lines as possible
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge today
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - consider carotid u/s per neuro recs
   - f/u hemoglobin A1C
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - 4 bed rail restraint, 2 ext restraints
 pulling at lines
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH. Increased
   dose [**1-29**] restarting feeding.  Home Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves
   #. HLD:
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the right omohyoid artery and left internal mammary artery grafts. A PROMUS stent was placed in the left internal mammary artery. The patient is currently pain-free and off nitroglycerin drip.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure of unclear etiology, sinus tachycardia, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation/mild mental status changes, possible cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA). He also has diabetes, ethanol abuse, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and anxiety/depression.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 121/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg. The patient has bibasilar"

   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 8, cefepime day 8 (plan for 8 day course)
   - d/c antibiotics after todays dose
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge today
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - consider carotid u/s per neuro recs
   - f/u hemoglobin A1C
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - 4 bed rail restraint, 2 ext restraints
 pulling at lines
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH. Increased
   dose [**1-29**] restarting feeding.  Home Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves
   #. HLD:
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol (EtOH) abuse. He presented to the hospital with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of a PROMUS stent in the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is agitated with sinus tachycardia.

The patient's past medical history includes chronic systolic heart failure (EF 51%) and a recent episode of acute decompensation requiring hospitalization. He has also had a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age, suggesting a possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, vancomycin, cefepime, lansoprazole, and insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented with NSTEMI, likely due to occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG)-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts. He underwent PCI with stent placement, which is"

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - continue lisinopril 2.5mg daily.
   #. Respiratory distress
 patient had bibasilar crackles, was volume up
   yesterday and is complaining of shortness of breath.  Patient has no
   further evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - vancomycin and cefipime discontinued yesterday.
   - CXR this AM
   - furosemide 40mg IV today.
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. Patient may have been
   hypovolemic before, but is now volume up.  Rate is now improved.
   - continue on metoprolol as above.
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: TTE on [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with
   global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.
   - furosemide as above.
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular

   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   - Discontinue foley, replace with condom catheter.
   - attempt to place peripheral IV, discontinue triple lumen.
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH. Increased
   dose [**1-29**] restarting feeding.  Home Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 24u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside

   Imaging: CXR:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-28**], there is little change
   in the
   appearance of the central catheter and gastric tube. Persistent low
   lung
   volumes. Bibasilar atelectatic changes without definite acute focal
   pneumonia
   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 8, cefepime day 8 (plan for 8 day course)
   - d/c antibiotics after todays dose
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - discontinue lines as possible
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge today
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - consider carotid u/s per neuro recs
   - f/u hemoglobin A1C
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - 4 bed rail restraint, 2 ext restraints
 pulling at lines
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH. Increased
   dose [**1-29**] restarting feeding.  Home Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves
   #. HLD:
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
