   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 11054**] is a 77M with h/o gastric adenocarcinoma who presents after
   a long hospitalization in [**Location (un) 11050**] for cholelithiasis s/p GB removal
   complicated by biliary sepsis, initially improved enough for transfer
   to the US but developed fever and hypotension and has pseudomonas and
   yeast growing out of his biliary fluids as well as a non-draining fluid
   collection seen on CT.
   .
   #Septic Shock: Given fever, rising WBC count, hypotension and
   hepatobiliary abscess growing psuedomonas and [**Female First Name (un) 444**] and undrained
   (possibly infected) fluid collection presumed [**2-6**] infection. Blood
   cultures from yesterday morning GNR. 2 units pRBC and fluid boluses.
   -Currently on Levophed, will try to wean; will trend CVPs
   -Vanco for GPCs, Start metronidazole, Ceftaz +Gent for pseudomonas
   (will load with Gent tonight then continue daily with Tobramycin per ID
   recs)
   -renally dose all meds, discuss ABx choices with ID
   -Carotid U/A re: ear sounds corresponding to pulse, given frequent
   central line cannulations
   -Fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) **] (renally dosed for Cr. 1.6 =GFR 36)
   -follow CVP
   -IR drainage of fluid collection for source control
   -ECHO to eval cardiac function and for endocarditis (audible murmur)
   -f/u final sensitivities of pseudomonas, [**Female First Name (un) **]
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: Patient has remote history of moderate
   transaminitis [**2-12**], thought possibly to to NASH, but no known
   cirrhosis. Patient's LFTs consistent with obstrutive process and though
   one drain appears to be draining, it is possible he has another
   biliious collection that is not bring drained.  Also the patient had a
   question of Klatskins tumor and per liver, cholangiocarcinoma cannot be
   ruled out.  MELD score currently 26. IR placed 2 PTCs and changed over
   original PTC
   -trend LFTs
   -f/u liver recs
   -patient may require biopsy of mass seen on CT, but patient is not
   aware of this and his family has asked us not to tell him in the short
   term and they would like to be part of the discussion.
   - biliary drains to gravity and will monitor output
   .
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Patient required HD x3-4 sessions in
   [**Location (un) 11050**], his kidneys recovered to creatinine of 1.4. Now 1.6 in the
   setting of hypotension, likely due to poor blood flow to kidneys/ATN.
   Significantly improved this morning at 1.2
   -Continue managing sepsis per above
   -Renally dose medications
   -If creatinine worsens, consider renal consult
   -Check PM lytes
   .
   * Leukopenia:  Presented with leukopenia which resolved after stopping
   meropenem. ANC 3950.
   -trend CBC
   -holding Meropenem
   .
   * Anemia:
   Hct trending down slowly, worsened yesterday in the setting of IVF.
   Likely due to chronic inflammation, though possibly some bone marrow
   suppression from ABX use.  Transfused two units yesterday and bumped
   appropriately. DIC also possible given sepsis.
   -transfuse for HCT <25
   -DIC labs
   .
   * CAD: Hypotension is unlikely cardiogenic, but patient does have CAD
   history.
   No symptoms currently suggestive of acute cardiac ischemia. Cardiac
   enzymes stable (Trop 0.05)
   -ECHO
   -hold BB, ASA, statin in setting of sepsis and LFT abnormalities

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma who presented after a long hospitalization for cholelithiasis post-GB removal complicated by biliary sepsis. He was initially improving enough for transfer to the US but developed fever and hypotension. Pseudomonas and yeast were growing out of his biliary fluids, as well as a non-draining fluid collection seen on CT. The patient is currently diagnosed with septic shock, likely due to a hepatobiliary abscess. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Vanco, metronidazole, Ceftaz + Gent for pseudomonas, and fluconazole for yeast. The patient also has LFT abnormalities and a history of moderate transaminitis, possibly related to NASH or an obstructive process. He may require a biopsy of the mass seen on CT. Additionally, the patient has acute on chronic renal failure, leukopenia, anemia, and a history of CAD. He is currently in the ICU receiving IV fluids and vasopressors, and is planned for transfer to transplant surgery today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already developed septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Liver Abscess: The patient has a confirmed liver abscess, which can continue to cause systemic symptoms and complications if not adequately drained"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of gastrectomy who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition is complicated by shock, septicemia, and a liver abscess. He presented with fever, hypotension, and was found to have a positive fever curve. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. He has been receiving multiple intravenous antibiotics and blood product transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fever, hypotension, and positive fever curve suggests an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis. This condition can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.

2. Liver Abscess: The presence of a liver abscess increases the risk of complications such as rupture, spread of infection, or abscess-related bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate drainage or surgical intervention may be necessary.

3. Shock: The patient's hypotension indicates shock, which can be caused by severe infection, blood loss, or other underlying conditions. Immediate management with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors is crucial to maintain adequate perfusion and organ function.

4. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): With the patient's compromised immune system and multiple organ involvement (e.g., liver, kidneys), there is a risk of MODS, where multiple organs fail due to systemic inflammation and decreased perfusion.

5. Antibiotic Resistance: Prolong"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 11054**] is a 77M with h/o gastric adenocarcinoma who presents after
   a long hospitalization in [**Location (un) 11050**] for cholelithiasis s/p GB removal
   complicated by biliary sepsis, initially improved enough for transfer
   to the US but developed fever and hypotension and has pseudomonas and
   yeast growing out of his biliary fluids as well as a non-draining fluid
   collection seen on CT.
   .
   #Septic Shock: Given fever, rising WBC count, hypotension and
   hepatobiliary abscess growing psuedomonas and [**Female First Name (un) 444**] and undrained
   (possibly infected) fluid collection presumed [**2-6**] infection. Blood
   cultures from yesterday morning GNR. 2 units pRBC and fluid boluses.
   -Currently on Levophed, will try to wean; will trend CVPs
   -Vanco for GPCs
   -Ceftaz +Gent for pseudomonas (will load with Gent tonight then
   continue daily with Tobramycin per ID recs)
   -Fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) **] (renally dosed for Cr. 1.6 =GFR 36)
   -follow CVP
   -IR drainage of fluid collection for source control
   -ECHO to eval cardiac function and for endocarditis (audible murmur)
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u final sensitivities of pseudomonas, [**Female First Name (un) **]
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: Patient has remote history of moderate
   transaminitis [**2-12**], thought possibly to to NASH, but no known
   cirrhosis. Patient's LFTs consistent with obstrutive process and though
   one drain appears to be draining, it is possible he has another
   biliious collection that is not bring drained.  Also the patient had a
   question of Klatskins tumor and per liver, cholangiocarcinoma cannot be
   ruled out.  MELD score currently 26. IR placed 2 PTCs and changed over
   original PTC
   -trend LFTs
   -f/u liver recs
   -patient may require biopsy of mass seen on CT, but patient is not
   aware of this and his family has asked us not to tell him in the short
   term and they would like to be part of the discussion.
   - biliary drains to gravity and will monitor output
   .
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Patient required HD x3-4 sessions in
   [**Location (un) 11050**], his kidneys recovered to creatinine of 1.4. Now 1.6 in the
   setting of hypotension, likely due to poor blood flow to kidneys/ATN.
   Significantly improved this morning at 1.2
   -Continue managing sepsis per above
   -Renally dose medications
   - If creatinine worsens, consider renal consult
   .
   * Leukopenia:  Presented with leukopenia which resolved after stopping
   meropenem. ANC 3950.
   -trend CBC
   -holding Meropenem
   .
   * Anemia:
   Hct trending down slowly, worsened yesterday in the setting of IVF.
   Likely due to chronic inflammation, though possibly some bone marrow
   suppression from ABX use.  Transfused two units yesterday and bumped
   appropriately. DIC also possible given sepsis.
   -transfuse for HCT <25
   -DIC labs
   .
   * CAD: Hypotension is unlikely cardiogenic, but patient does have CAD
   history.
   No symptoms currently suggestive of acute cardiac ischemia. Cardiac
   enzymes stable (Trop 0.05)
   -ECHO
   -hold BB, ASA, statin in setting of sepsis and LFT abnormalities

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma who has been hospitalized for cholelithiasis following gallbladder removal. He developed biliary sepsis and was transferred to the US but subsequently developed fever, hypotension, and a hepatobiliary abscess with pseudomonas and yeast growth in the biliary fluids. Additionally, there is an undrained fluid collection seen on CT.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient has fever, rising WBC count, hypotension, and a hepatobiliary abscess growing pseudomonas. Blood cultures from yesterday morning showed GNR. The patient is already receiving fluids and blood transfusions, and antibiotics have been started for GPCs, pseudomonas, and yeast.

2. Liver Abscess: The patient has a liver abscess that needs to be addressed through interventional radiology drainage.

3. LFT Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, possibly due to an obstructive process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, and it is possible that the patient may require a biopsy of the mass seen on CT.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and required hemodialysis in the previous location. His creatinine levels are currently elevated at 1.6, but they have improved"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old man with severe sepsis, presumed to be from a biliary source. The patient underwent interventional radiology (IR) procedures for drainage and appears to have improved hemodynamics. He is currently on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, tobramycin, fluconazole, and Flagyl as per ID recommendations. There is a discussion about potentially changing the antibiotic due to tinnitus, which is a side effect of aminoglycosides.

The patient also has acute renal failure, likely related to hemodynamic/sepsis, but improving. He has anemia, leukopenia, known coronary artery disease (CAD) with a reversible defect, and new-onset tinnitus. There is a concern for a possible pseudoaneurysm due to prior internal jugular (IJ) cannulation, and a carotid ultrasound is planned to exclude it. The murmur, which was previously present, has resolved.

There is a mention of a possible tumor near the hepatic arteries, but further imaging is needed when the patient is more stable. The family wishes to be present for any discussion regarding this issue. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis is being held temporarily, and the patient's disposition is to the SICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, further deterioration of renal function, development of new infections due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 11054**] is a 77M with h/o gastric adenocarcinoma who presents after
   a long hospitalization in [**Location (un) 11050**] for cholelithiasis s/p GB removal
   complicated by biliary sepsis, initially improved enough for transfer
   to the US but developed fever and hypotension and has pseudomonas and
   yeast growing out of his biliary fluids as well as a non-draining fluid
   collection seen on CT.
   .
   #Septic Shock: Given fever, rising WBC count, hypotension and
   hepatobiliary abscess growing psuedomonas and [**Female First Name (un) 444**] and undrained
   (possibly infected) fluid collection presumed [**2-6**] infection. Blood
   cultures from yesterday morning GNR. 2 units pRBC and fluid boluses.
   -Currently on Levophed, will try to wean; will trend CVPs
   -Vanco for GPCs, Start metronidazole, Ceftaz +Gent for pseudomonas
   (will load with Gent tonight then continue daily with Tobramycin per ID
   recs)
   -renally dose all meds, discuss ABx choices with ID
   -Carotid U/A re: ear sounds corresponding to pulse, given frequent
   central line cannulations
   -Fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) **] (renally dosed for Cr. 1.6 =GFR 36)
   -follow CVP
   -IR drainage of fluid collection for source control
   -ECHO to eval cardiac function and for endocarditis (audible murmur)
   -f/u final sensitivities of pseudomonas, [**Female First Name (un) **]
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: Patient has remote history of moderate
   transaminitis [**2-12**], thought possibly to to NASH, but no known
   cirrhosis. Patient's LFTs consistent with obstrutive process and though
   one drain appears to be draining, it is possible he has another
   biliious collection that is not bring drained.  Also the patient had a
   question of Klatskins tumor and per liver, cholangiocarcinoma cannot be
   ruled out.  MELD score currently 26. IR placed 2 PTCs and changed over
   original PTC
   -trend LFTs
   -f/u liver recs
   -patient may require biopsy of mass seen on CT, but patient is not
   aware of this and his family has asked us not to tell him in the short
   term and they would like to be part of the discussion.
   - biliary drains to gravity and will monitor output
   .
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Patient required HD x3-4 sessions in
   [**Location (un) 11050**], his kidneys recovered to creatinine of 1.4. Now 1.6 in the
   setting of hypotension, likely due to poor blood flow to kidneys/ATN.
   Significantly improved this morning at 1.2
   -Continue managing sepsis per above
   -Renally dose medications
   -If creatinine worsens, consider renal consult
   -Check PM lytes
   .
   * Leukopenia:  Presented with leukopenia which resolved after stopping
   meropenem. ANC 3950.
   -trend CBC
   -holding Meropenem
   .
   * Anemia:
   Hct trending down slowly, worsened yesterday in the setting of IVF.
   Likely due to chronic inflammation, though possibly some bone marrow
   suppression from ABX use.  Transfused two units yesterday and bumped
   appropriately. DIC also possible given sepsis.
   -transfuse for HCT <25
   -DIC labs
   .
   * CAD: Hypotension is unlikely cardiogenic, but patient does have CAD
   history.
   No symptoms currently suggestive of acute cardiac ischemia. Cardiac
   enzymes stable (Trop 0.05)
   -ECHO
   -hold BB, ASA, statin in setting of sepsis and LFT abnormalities

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma who has been hospitalized for cholelithiasis and subsequent gallbladder removal. He developed biliary sepsis and was transferred to the ICU for management. The patient's condition worsened, leading to septic shock, and he was found to have a hepatobiliary abscess with growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and yeast.

The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin for gram-positive cocci, metronidazole, ceftazidime, and tobramycin for Pseudomonas coverage. Fluid resuscitation has been initiated with two units of packed red blood cells and fluid boluses. Levophed has been started to support blood pressure, and the patient's central venous pressure (CVP) will be monitored.

Other assessments and plans include:
1. Left femoral arterial line placed on [**2103-2-22**] 04:07 PM
2. Multi-lumen central venous line placed on [**2103-2-22**] 04:25 PM
3. Arterial line placed on [**2103-2-23**] 05:39 AM
4. Prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being administered.
5. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, likely due to an obstructive process. Further evaluation and management are required.
6. The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.6. Renal dosing of medications is necessary, and the patient's renal function will be closely monitored.
7. Anemia is present, and the patient has received two units of packed red blood cells. Transfusion will be considered if the hemoglobin level drops below 25.
8. The patient's leukopenia has resolved after discontinuing meropenem.
9. The patient is scheduled for an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function and assess for endocarditis.
10. A cholangiogram is pending to further evaluate the biliary tree and drainage options.
11. The patient's family has requested not to disclose information about a possible liver biopsy to the patient at this time.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is currently dealing with septic shock and has positive cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and yeast. There is a risk of ongoing infection, and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be continued.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential renal impairment. Close monitoring and management of fluid balance and renal function are essential.
3. Liver failure: The patient's L"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 11054**] is a 77M with h/o gastric adenocarcinoma who presents after
   a long hospitalization in [**Location (un) 11050**] for cholelithiasis s/p GB removal
   complicated by biliary sepsis, initially improved enough for transfer
   to the US but developed fever and hypotension and has pseudomonas and
   yeast growing out of his biliary fluids as well as a non-draining fluid
   collection seen on CT.
   .
   #Septic Shock: Given fever, rising WBC count, hypotension and
   hepatobiliary abscess growing psuedomonas and [**Female First Name (un) 444**] and undrained
   (possibly infected) fluid collection presumed [**2-6**] infection.S/p IR
   guided drainage of biliary fluid. 2 units pRBC and fluid boluses. Off
   pressors since yesterday. Micro as above. Currently on cipro,
   ceftazidime, flagyl, fluconazole. TTE negative for valvular pathology
   -Appreciate ID recs for antibiotic/antifungal regimen
   -renally dose all meds
   -Follow up Carotid U/S (? AV malformation, given frequent central
   venous lines)
   -follow CVP
   -IR drainage of fluid collection for source control
   -f/u final sensitivities of pseudomonas, [**Female First Name (un) **]
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: Patient has remote history of moderate
   transaminitis [**2-12**], thought possibly to to NASH, but no known
   cirrhosis. LFTs c/w obstructive process, now s/p drainage.  LFT
   improving today. Also the patient had a question of Klatskins tumor and
   per liver, cholangiocarcinoma cannot be ruled out.
   -trend LFTs
   -f/u liver recs
   -patient may require biopsy of mass seen on CT, but patient is not
   aware of this and his family has asked us not to tell him in the short
   term and they would like to be part of the discussion.
   - biliary drains to gravity and will monitor output
   .
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Patient required HD x3-4 sessions in
   [**Location (un) 11050**], his kidneys recovered to creatinine of 1.4. Nadir at 1.2, but
   increased back to 1.6 today.
   -Urine lytes, creatinine
   -Continue managing sepsis per above
   -Renally dose medications
   -Low threshold for renal consult given recent HD
   -Check PM lytes
   .
   * Anemia:
   Hct trending down slowly, worsened yesterday in the setting of IVF.
   Likely due to chronic inflammation, though possibly some bone marrow
   suppression from ABX use.  Transfused two units yesterday and bumped
   appropriately. DIC also possible given sepsis.
   -transfuse for HCT <25
   -DIC labs
   .
   * CAD: Hypotension is unlikely cardiogenic, but patient does have CAD
   history. Echo showing normal ventricular function.
   No symptoms currently suggestive of acute cardiac ischemia. Cardiac
   enzymes stable negative.
   -can restart BB, ASA,
   -holding statin in setting of sepsis and LFT abnormalities

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma who has been hospitalized for cholelithiasis after gallbladder removal.
- He developed biliary sepsis and was transferred to the US but later developed fever and hypotension.
- The patient has pseudomonas and yeast growing out of his biliary fluids, as well as a non-draining fluid collection seen on CT.
- He is currently being treated for septic shock with antibiotics and antifungal medications.
- The patient also has LFT abnormalities, likely due to an obstructive process, which is improving after drainage.
- There is a question of Klatskin tumor and possible cholangiocarcinoma.
- He has acute on chronic renal failure, requiring dialysis sessions.
- The patient's Hct is trending down, possibly due to chronic inflammation or bone marrow suppression from antibiotic use.
- He has a history of CAD but no current symptoms suggestive of acute cardiac ischemia.
- The patient is NPO and has multiple IV lines, including a CVL, PIV, and arterial line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state, presence of central venous lines, and recent antibiotic use.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, especially if not properly managed with fluid and electrolyte balance.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible liver damage or obstruction. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Cardiovascular Issues: Although the patient's current cardiac enzymes are stable, his history of CAD increases the risk of cardiovascular events.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is decreasing, indicating a need for transfusion support. Monitoring for signs of bone marrow suppression and DIC is important.
6. Pseudomonas Infection: The presence of pseudomonas in the biliary fluids increases the risk of systemic infection and sepsis.
7. Yeast Infection: The growth of yeast in the biliary fluids may indicate an opportunistic fungal infection, which can be challenging to treat.
8. Fluid Collection: The non-draining fluid collection seen on CT could potentially lead to abscess formation or further complications if not managed appropriately.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."
