","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hemoptysis and respiratory failure. The patient initially presented with fever and shortness of breath, diagnosed as a COPD exacerbation. He was intubated and started on antibiotics and steroids. However, he experienced a re-intubation on the same day due to ongoing hemoptysis, and a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed on August 22nd. The patient also developed Clostridium difficile infection and was treated with vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of bilateral hazy infiltrates in the lower lung fields on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness increase the risk of stress ulcer formation.
5. ventilator-associated events: The patient's ventilator settings indicate the use of assist/control mode ventilation, which carries its own set of complications.
6. Fluid imbalance: The fluid balance chart shows a positive balance, indicating fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or cardiac complications.
7. Hypoxemia:"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 1108**] is a 68 year-old woman with history of PAF, COPD, and
   hypercapneic respiratory failure s/p trach/peg who is transferred from
   [**Hospital1 183**] for management of hemoptysis.
   #  Hemoptysis:  Likely related to mucosal/soft tissue injury from ETT
   in setting of an elevated INR but could also be secondary to pulmonary
   source, given previously visualized bloody secretions in airway.
   However, chest CT is negative for evidence of hemorrhage and no clear
   source seen on bronch.  Differential also includes infection, TB,
   vascular injury and less likely DAH, vasculitities, neoplasm.
   - would suggest repeating bronch
   - will attempt to obtain chest CT images
   - BAL with gm stain/culture, AFB
   - low suspicion for TB so will defer respiratory precautions
   - hold on antibx for now
   - no role for IR/angio at this time but would consult if bleeding
   increases
   - daily hct
   - f/u anca, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-gbm studies at [**Hospital1 183**]
   # Hypercapneic respiratory failure/COPD:  Secondary to COPD
   exacerbation.  She is s/p trach/peg.  Was started on vanc on
   admission/other antibiotics (not listed in records) and completed 7 day
   course of zosyn on [**8-28**].  On steroid taper and last received solumedrol
   40 mg iv daily on [**8-28**].
   - continue prednisone taper
   - albuterol and ipatroprium MBIs
   - cont AC for now
   - no antibiotics
   # PAF: on verapamil and warfarin as an outpatient.
   - continue verapamil
   - will hold on warfarin/aspirin for now
   # C. diff colitis:  Started on po vanc while hospitalized; likely
   secondary to antibiotics.  On day 8 on day of transfer.
   - would hold on po vanc and cont flagyl
   - check c. diff
   FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   Access: Right subclavian vein for access.
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

   #  Hemoptysis:  Likely related to mucosal/soft tissue injury from ETT
   in setting of an elevated INR but could also be secondary to pulmonary
   source, given previously visualized bloody secretions in airway.  Other
   possibilities include bronchiectasis v. DAH, infection, neoplasm,
   though no acute process seen on chest CT at OSH
   - Increase size of trach tube for bronchoscopy
   - Repeat bronch this afternoon
   - Obtain CT images from OSH
   - Low suspicion for TB so will defer respiratory precautions
   - Hold on antibx for now
   - no role for IR/angio at this time but would consult if bleeding
   increases
   - daily hct
   - F/U anca, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-gbm studies at [**Hospital1 183**]
   # Hypercapneic respiratory failure/COPD:  Patient has been on AC and
   was not able to be sustained on PS.  Secondary to COPD exacerbation.
   She is s/p trach/peg.  Was started on vanc on admission/other
   antibiotics (not listed in records) and completed 7 day course of zosyn
   on [**8-28**].  On steroid taper and last received solumedrol 40 mg iv daily
   on [**8-28**].
   - Continue prednisone taper (Continue 20 [**Hospital1 **] now and start taper
   tomorrow)
   - Albuterol and ipatroprium MDIs
   - Cont AC for now
   - Continue to hold antibiotics
   # PAF: On Verapamil and Amiodarone and Warfarin as an outpatient.
   - Continue verapamil and Amiodarone
   - Will hold on warfarin/aspirin for now
   # C. diff colitis:  Started on po vanc while hospitalized; likely
   secondary to antibiotics.  On day 8 on day of transfer.
   - Continue Flagyl 500 mg TID.  (Now day [**8-18**])

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with severe COPD and a history of pulmonary embolism on coumadin. She was admitted to the hospital with a COPD exacerbation and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient failed extubation due to hemoptysis and was reintubated and tracheostomized. She is currently being transferred for work-up of recurrent hemoptysis, as previous bronchoscopies did not identify any focal sources of bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), blood pressure ranging from 146/56-153/71 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen, and receiving tube feeds. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 255 mL since midnight.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 170 K/uL, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows increased lower lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray, which could be due to blood, pulmonary edema, or atelectasis. Microbiology results are pending.

   sources of bleeding.
   Hemoptysis etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] obtain CT from OSH on CD for
   review. To perform an adequate bronch will change the trach to 8.0 with
   same outer diameter and bronch in PM. If bleeding worsens will give
   DDAVP.
   She has many barriers to extubation, likely including fluid overload,
   COPD, and muscle weakness. Will address these after work-up of

   Ms. [**Known lastname 1108**] is a 68 year-old woman with history of PAF, COPD, and
   hypercapneic respiratory failure s/p trach/peg who is transferred from
   [**Hospital1 183**] for management of hemoptysis.
   #  Hemoptysis:  Likely related to underlying pulmonary disease
   (emphysematous changes) vs mucosal/soft tissue injury from ETT in
   setting of an elevated INR; could also be secondary to pulmonary
   source, given previously visualized bloody secretions in airway.  Other
   possibilities include bronchiectasis v. DAH, infection, neoplasm,
   though no acute process seen on chest CT.  Hct stable.
   - s/p increased size of trach tube for bronchoscopy
   - continue to follow for evidence of bleeding
   - F/U anca, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-gbm studies. RF neg.
   - no role for antibx
   - no role for IR/angio at this time but would consult if bleeding
   increases
   - consider serial lavages  to eval for DAH
   - daily hct
   # Hypercapneic respiratory failure/COPD:  Patient has been on AC and
   was not able to be sustained on PS.  Secondary to COPD exacerbation.
   She is s/p trach/peg.  Was started on vanc on admission/other
   antibiotics (not listed in records) and completed 7 day course of zosyn
   on [**8-28**].  On steroid taper and last received solumedrol 40 mg iv daily
   on [**8-28**].
   - Continue prednisone taper (today is day 21 of steroids)
   - Albuterol and ipatroprium MDIs
   - will attempt trial of PS
   - Continue to hold antibiotics
   # PAF: On Verapamil and Amiodarone and Warfarin as an outpatient.
   - Continue verapamil and Amiodarone
   - Will hold on warfarin/aspirin for now
   # C. diff colitis:  Started on po vanc while hospitalized; likely
   secondary to antibiotics.
   - Continue Flagyl 500 mg TID.  (Now day [**9-18**])

- The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary embolism and atrial fibrillation (PAF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypercapneic respiratory failure post tracheostomy/peg tube placement. She was transferred from another hospital for the management of hemoptysis.
- The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid culture. The bronchoscopy revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), but no obvious source of bleeding. BALs were sent for further analysis.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/48 to 158/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 255 mL over the past 24 hours, with an output of 2,725 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,470 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1108**] is a 68 year-old woman with history of PAF, COPD, and
   hypercapneic respiratory failure s/p trach/peg who is transferred from
   [**Hospital1 183**] for management of hemoptysis.
   #  Hemoptysis:  Likely related to underlying pulmonary disease
   (emphysematous changes) vs mucosal/soft tissue injury from ETT in
   setting of an elevated INR; could also be secondary to pulmonary
   source, given previously visualized bloody secretions in airway.  Other
   possibilities include bronchiectasis v. DAH, infection, neoplasm,
   though no acute process seen on chest CT.  Hct stable.
   - s/p increased size of trach tube for bronchoscopy
   - continue to follow for evidence of bleeding
   - F/U anca, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-gbm studies. RF neg.
   - no role for antibx
   - no role for IR/angio at this time but would consult if bleeding
   increases
   - upload CT images from OSH
   - daily hct
   # Hypercapneic respiratory failure/COPD:  Patient has been on AC and
   was not able to be sustained on PS.  Secondary to COPD exacerbation.
   She is s/p trach/peg.  Was started on vanc on admission/other
   antibiotics (not listed in records) and completed 7 day course of zosyn
   on [**8-28**].  On steroid taper and last received solumedrol 40 mg iv daily
   on [**8-28**].
   - Continue prednisone taper (today is day 21 of steroids)
   - Albuterol and ipatroprium MDIs
   - will attempt trial of PS
   - Continue to hold antibiotics
   # PAF: On Verapamil and Amiodarone and Warfarin as an outpatient.
   - Continue verapamil and Amiodarone
   - Will hold on warfarin/aspirin for now
   # C. diff colitis:  Started on po vanc while hospitalized; likely
   secondary to antibiotics.
   - Continue Flagyl 500 mg TID.  (Now day [**9-18**])

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of PAF (pulmonary arterial fibrillation), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and hypercapneic respiratory failure who was transferred from another hospital for management of hemoptysis (coughing up blood).

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and had a multi-lumen stop at 07:51 PM on 08/29/2113. The physical examination revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, no obvious source of bleeding, and a possible small tear. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were sent for analysis.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including lorazepam, morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/48 to 158/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 255-258 mL and output of 570 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,470 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 45%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI)"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC

   resp failure requiring trach and peg, now with persistent hemoptysis of
   unclear etiology. The hemoptysis appears to be slowing down though has
   not resolved completely. The most likely explanation remains
   non-specific inflammation of airways from copd exacerbation, although
   it did seem to develop in the middle of her hospitalization. DAH seems
   very unlikely given CT findings, but will follow-up rheumatological
   serologies. Will still consider changing trach to one with bigger inner
   cannula size to be able to perform adequate BAL.
   Assuming hemoptysis will subside, with continue weaning from the
   ventilatory support and begin screening for LTAC.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the hospital with a COPD exacerbation and respiratory failure, requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy.
- She has been experiencing persistent hemoptysis, which has not completely resolved.
- The most likely explanation for the hemoptysis is non-specific inflammation of the airways due to COPD exacerbation, but other possibilities such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) are being considered and ruled out.
- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 143/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 45%.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count.
- The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but there is evidence of hyperglycemia.
- The patient's imaging and microbiology reports are pending.
- The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently receiving"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of PAF (pulmonary arterial hypertension), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and hypercapneic respiratory failure who was admitted to the ICU for management of hemoptysis (coughing up blood). The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions for her conditions, including tracheostomy and peg tube placement, antibiotics, bronchial washings, and respiratory support.

From the assessment and plan section of the note, it appears that the patient's hemoptysis is likely related to her underlying pulmonary disease or mucosal/soft tissue injury from the endotracheal tube (ETT) in the setting of an elevated INR. The healthcare team is monitoring for any signs of bleeding and plans to follow up with anti-GBM (anti-glomerular basement membrane) studies, rule out bronchiectasis or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and consider serial lavages to evaluate for DAH.

The patient's hypercapneic respiratory failure/COPD is attributed to a COPD exacerbation. She has been on bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium) and inhaled corticosteroids (prednisone taper). The team is attempting a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) and plans to continue the prednisone taper, albuterol, and ipratropium MD"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1108**] is a 68-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypercapnic respiratory failure who was admitted to the ICU for management of hemoptysis. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has undergone a tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG). The patient has shown stability in her vital signs, with no fever or increased heart rate. Her respiratory status has improved, but she still requires supplemental oxygen. There are no new findings on physical examination. Laboratory results show stable kidney function, slightly elevated liver enzymes, and normal electrolyte levels. Blood cultures have been negative. The patient continues to be on various medications, including antibiotics for a suspected Clostridium difficile infection, bronchodilators for COPD, and anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation.

Potential Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis is likely related to her underlying pulmonary disease, such as emphysematous changes or mucosal/soft tissue injury from the endotracheal tube. Other possibilities include bronchiectasis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DAH), infection, or neoplasm. The chest CT did not reveal any acute processes, and her hematocrit levels are stable. Monitoring for evidence of bleeding and following up with anti-GBM studies would be appropriate. Serial"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEMOPTYSIS
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   68F with severe COPD, s/p trach and peg, txr from OSH for hemoptysis,
   still no clear aetiology but several reassuring bronchoscopies, now
   with decreased hemoptysis. Although hemoptysis continues, Hct remains
   stable and it seems to be improving. There is no evidence of infection
   based on BAL, but viral cultures are pending. Suspicion for infection
   is low.
   Pt is ready for discharge to rehab to continue liberation from
   ventilator support. Future trach changes will be done at the rehab.
   Steroid taper should be slow, probably by 10 mg weekly, to be finalized
   by pulmonologists at rehab. She will finish her course of flagyl for
   c.diff infection in several days. Although she has afib, will hold off
   continuing warfarin given hemoptysis, but should be restarted soon.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and hemoptysis, which is the coughing up of blood.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission, except for the noted improvement in hemoptysis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support in the form of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 45%.

The physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, except for right lower extremity edema, which is absent. The vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, blood pressure within normal limits, heart rate within normal limits, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

Laboratory results indicate stable levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. Imaging shows improved bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray. Microbiology tests reveal negative results for bacterial culture from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), with viral cultures pending.

The assessment and plan state that the patient is ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility to"
