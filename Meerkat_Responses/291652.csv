   7.42/44/58/30.  Pt unable to clear secreations in the setting of
   lethargy from prior valium. He was given Flumazenil and mental status
   improved and able to clear secreations without many extra flumazenil
   doses. Pt secreations likely from aspiration pna and sinusitis. No
   evidence of volume overload on exam.  Pt with rising WBC and fever to
   102. He is being treated with Zosyn. CT head negative for acute
   process.
   - plan to cont Zosyn for aspiration pna
   - keep patient NPO given aspiration risk
   - Flumazenil 0.2mg prn for lethargy and inability to clear secreations,
   if refractory will need intubation.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - monitor mental status closely

   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - cont dilt 10mg IV q6 to maintain HR <100 and can titrate up freq.
   Will hold off on dilt drip for now. Avoiding BB given h/o cocaine abuse
   in the past, not the best long term medication
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   - transition to po when mental status improves.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, and a risk for aspiration.

Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress, as indicated by the ABG results showing a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 116 and an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's inability to clear secretions may be due to lethargy from prior Valium use. Flumazenil administration improved mental status and allowed for better airway clearance.

Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, which was previously controlled with oral diltiazem. However, the patient is now NPO (nothing by mouth), and his CHADS-2 score is zero. ASA for long-term thromboembolic prophylaxis is recommended, but it is being withheld in the acute setting.

Altered Mental Status: The patient has been somnolent for the last three days and received a large dose of Valium in the ICU. Mental status improvement was observed with flumazenil administration, suggesting benzodiazepine-induced lethargy. No evidence of meningitis is present.

Risk for Aspiration: The patient has an increased risk of aspiration due to altered mental status and inability to protect the airway. Measures such"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. They have altered mental status, aspiration pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation (afib). The patient's heart rate is high, ranging from 115-120 bpm, and they have a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). They are receiving IV diltiazem every four hours and antibiotics. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but they have an increased respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute. Their blood pressure is elevated at 147/100 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 93% on aerosol-cool delivery. They are receiving fluids through a PICC line and have received a total of 1,978 mL of fluids, with an output of 950 mL. The patient's urine output is 700 mL. They are on respiratory support and have an endotracheal tube in place. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. Their eyes are PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), and their cardiovascular examination shows a normal PMI (point of maximal impulse) with no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. Their peripheral vascular examination shows no edema in the extremities. The respiratory examination shows symmetric chest expansion with coarse crackles in the upper airway, and their abdomen is soft and non-tender.

   #. Respiratory Distress: Hypoxemic respiratory distress with ABG
   7.42/44/58/30.  Pt unable to clear secreations in the setting of
   lethargy from prior valium. He was given Flumazenil and mental status
   improved somewhat. NSG able to clear secreations without flumazenil
   doses. Pt secreations likely from aspiration pna and sinusitis. No
   evidence of volume overload on exam.  Pt with fever to 102. He is being
   treated with Zosyn. CT head negative for acute process.
   - serum and urine tox positive for benzos
   - cont Zosyn for aspiration PNA
   - keep patient NPO given aspiration risk, nutrition through tube feeds
   - Flumazenil 0.2mg prn for lethargy and inability to clear secreations
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - monitor mental status closely
   - cont to trend WBC and fever curve

   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO with good control. CHADS-2 score of
   zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term thromboembolic ppx, but
   will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue dilt given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: [**Name (NI) 8198**] pt has been somnolent for the last
   3 days on the floors. He did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during
   his stay. CT-head was negative. His mental status improves with
   flumazenil so likely BZD is causing his lethargy. No evidence of
   menengitis.
   - U tox as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, respiratory failure, and an inability to protect the airway. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Key findings from the note include:
- The patient's mental status improved after administration of flumazenil, indicating possible benzodiazepine overdose.
- The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to aspiration pneumonia and sinusitis, with no evidence of volume overload.
- The patient has a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit and is being treated with Zosyn.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol.
- The patient's CHADS-2 score is zero, and ASA for long-term thromboembolic prevention is planned but will be held off in the acute setting.
- The patient's mental status has been somnolent for the last three days, possibly due to a large valium dose, but improves with flumazenil.
- The patient is past the withdrawal window for alcohol detoxification.
- The patient has been started on tube feeding due to the inability to protect the airway.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and inability to clear secretions increase the risk of further respiratory failure.
2. Aspiration pneumonia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, altered mental status, inability to protect airway, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation due to desaturation, lack of gag reflex, and copious secretions. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia and possible pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to the likely PE or other causes such as being intubated with PEEP, aggressive bagging prior to intubation, or sedation.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has thick secretions and loss of gag and cough reflex, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics are being continued, and measures are being taken to suction secretions and prevent further aspiration.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It is being managed with diltiazem and metoprolol. Long-term thromboembolic prophylaxis with ASA is being considered, but held off in the acute setting.
5. Change in Mental Status: The patient has been somnolent for the last three days, possibly"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Heart rate better controlled after initiation of diltiazem via NG tube.
   Continued to have problems managing secretions during the night and
   became increasingly hypoxemic which led to intubation. Patient's
   hypoxemia persisted despite intubation and he became hypotensive (had
   received propofol for intubation). We did an emergent bronchoscopy and
   aspirated small amounts of moderately thick secretions from the RLL and
   LLL; no discrete mucus plugs. Oxygenation has slowly improved since
   bronchoscopy. Central line placed following bronchoscopy.

   HYPOTENSION
   ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA
   ======================
   Patient continues to have tachypnea that cannot be alleviated despite
   multiple different ventilatory strategies. Needs at least 60% oxygen
   and seems to have considerable dead space with high ventilation
   requirements. With a CXR that shows relatively little parenchymal
   change, our biggest concern is acute pulmonary embolism.
   Anticoagulation is being started and we will obtain an emergent CTA.
   Hypotension likely related to reduced intravascular volume (CVP is low
   and there are significant swings in CVP with respiration) and possible
   contribution of autoPEEP (rapid respiratory rate; difficult to measure
   because he is recruiting expiratory muscles). Obstruction from PE also
   may be contributing to this problem.  Giving fluids. Started on low
   dose Propofol to try to reduce resp rate.
   On antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.
   Mental status has remained altered; benzos still present in serum.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's heart rate has been better controlled after the initiation of diltiazem via NG tube. However, the patient continued to have problems managing secretions during the night and became increasingly hypoxemic, leading to intubation. Despite intubation, the patient's hypoxemia persisted and they became hypotensive after receiving propofol for intubation. An emergent bronchoscopy was performed, and small amounts of moderately thick secretions were aspirated from the right lower lobe and left lower lobe. Oxygenation has slowly improved since the bronchoscopy. A central line was placed following the bronchoscopy.

The patient is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 06:00 AM on 09/17/2164. The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications, including diltiazem, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), propofol, fentanyl, and others.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 145 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/86 mmHg to 167/120"

   not help.  Currently on AC, Vt 550, RR 15, PEEP 10.  Pt secreations
   likely from aspiration pna and sinusitis. No evidence of volume
   overload on exam.  Serum and urine tox positive for benzos.  Patient is
   drawing large minute ventilation but not saturating well, very
   concerned for PE
   - cont Zosyn for aspiration PNA
   - CTA to assess for PE

   # Hypotension
 likely in setting of likely PE.  Other possible causes
   can be due to being intubated with a PEEP of 10, being aggressively
   bagged prior to intubation, sedation

   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue dilt given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's current conditions include acute respiratory failure, inability to protect airway, pulmonary embolism, altered mental status, and hypotension.

The patient was intubated this morning for desaturation, lack of gag reflex, and copious secretions that could not be cleared. He is currently on assisted control ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. The patient's secretions are likely due to aspiration pneumonia and sinusitis. There is no evidence of volume overload on examination. Serum and urine toxicology tests are positive for benzodiazepines. The patient is drawing large minute ventilation but not saturating well, and there is concern for a pulmonary embolism.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to the pulmonary embolism. Other possible causes include being intubated with PEEP, aggressive bagging prior to intubation, and sedation. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been ordered to assess for pulmonary embolism.

The patient also has aspiration pneumonia, which is likely caused by the inability to clear secretions and loss of gag and cough reflexes. Zosyn (p"

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Found to have b/l PE, s/p tPa treatment, now on
   heparin drip.  Currently intubated and sedated.  Will try pt on trial
   of PS at 15/5 as patient saturated well on AC.  Pt
s secretions likely
   from aspiration pna and sinusitis. CXR showed b/l pleural effusions,
   likely due to large volumes of fluids pt received yesterday.
   - cont Zosyn for aspiration PNA
   - heparin drip
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - propofol and fentanyl for sedation, avoid benzos
   - VAP bundle
   - cont to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Hypotension
 likely in setting of likely PE.  SBPs have been stable
   overnight in 100-110s.  Other possible causes can be due to being
   intubated with a PEEP of 10, being aggressively bagged prior to
   intubation, sedation
   - continue to monitor BP
   .
   # Bleeding
 pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during tPa
   treatment.  Bleeding likely secondary to trauma sustained during
   aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.  ENT was consulted to help
   control bleed since patient would likely need heparin drip after the
   tPa for the PE.  ENT packed patient
s nose, said would follow up in 2
   days to reassess.  In the meantime patient is safe to receive heparin.
   - packing is considered foreign object, need to cover for staph and
   strep.  Pt is already on zosyn which should provide adequate coverage.
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonia
 patient had thick secretions that were unable
   to be suctioned and loss of gag and cough reflex prior to intubation,
   aspiration pneumonia is a consideration.
   - continue zosyn
   - CXR
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue dilt given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Unable to assess right now as patient is
   sedated.  [**Name (NI) 8198**] pt has been somnolent for the last 3 days on the
   floors. He did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay.
   CT-head was negative.
   - will taper down sedation in order to assess mental status time to
   time
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Currently
   lethargic from large valium dose.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient developed bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and received thrombolytic therapy (tPa). He is currently on a heparin drip and is intubated and sedated. The patient's secretions are likely from aspiration pneumonia and sinusitis. His chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions, which are likely due to large volumes of fluids he received yesterday.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and bleeding. The respiratory failure is due to bilateral PE and the patient is on heparin drip. He is intubated and sedated. The altered mental status may be related to ethanol withdrawal or aspiration pneumonia. The atrial fibrillation is new-onset and the patient has a CHADS-2 score of zero. The hypotension is likely due to the PE and aggressive bagging prior to intubation. The bleeding is from the anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment and is secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.

The patient is already on zosyn for aspiration pneumonia. The packing in the patient's nose is considered a foreign object, and coverage for staph and strep should be provided. The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, hypotension, pulmonary embolism, hypernatremia, and acidosis. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with an acute PE, which is a blockage in one or more arteries in the lungs. This can lead to impaired blood flow and oxygenation.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to encephalopathy or other factors. This could be a result of the PE or another underlying condition.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has developed AFib, an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications.

4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is suffering from acute respiratory failure, which means their lungs are not providing enough oxygen to the body. This may be a direct consequence of the PE and could lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.

5. Risk for Aspiration: Due to the patient's inability to protect their airway, there is a risk of aspiration, where food, liquid, or stomach contents are inhaled into the lungs. This can cause infections and other respiratory problems.

6. Acidosis: The patient has nongap metabolic acidosis, which is likely related to"

   .
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Found to have b/l PE, s/p tPa treatment, now on
   heparin drip.  Currently intubated and sedated.  Pt
s secretions likely
   from aspiration PNA and sinusitis.  Pt may be fluid overloaded
 no CXR
   today for comparison but pressure dropped with Lasix.
   - Attempt diuresis with lower Lasix dose.
   - cont Zosyn for aspiration PNA
   - heparin drip for PE
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - propofol and fentanyl for sedation, avoid benzos
   - VAP bundle
   - cont to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Hypotension
 likely in setting of likely PE. Pt had episodes of
   Hypotension following Lasix and received back fluid with subsequent
   stable SBPs.  Pt with GPC positive BCx so may be element of sepsis.
   Other possible causes can be due to being intubated with a PEEP of 10,
   being aggressively bagged prior to intubation, sedation
   - continue vanco for GPC bacteremia pending speciation
   - continue to monitor BP
   -?gently diurese with Lasix 10mg IV
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable with no new episodes of bleeding. pt had
   bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment.  Bleeding
   likely secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior
   to intubation.  Patient is safe to receive heparin.
   -ENT to evaluate packing in nose today
 will f/u with them.
   - packing is considered foreign object, need to cover for staph and
   strep.  Pt is already on zosyn which should provide adequate coverage.
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonia
 patient had thick secretions that were unable
   to be suctioned and loss of gag and cough reflex prior to intubation,
   aspiration pneumonia is a consideration.
   - continue zosyn
   - CXR
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Unable to assess right now as patient is
   sedated.  [**Name (NI) 8198**] pt has been somnolent for the last 3 days on the
   floors. He did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay.
   CT-head was negative.
   - will taper down sedation in order to assess mental status time to
   time
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Currently
   lethargic from large valium dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification.
- The patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- The patient presented with respiratory failure due to bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), which was treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) and is currently on a heparin drip.
- The patient is intubated and sedated, with likely secretions from aspiration pneumonia and sinusitis.
- The patient may be fluid overloaded, as indicated by decreased pressures after administering Lasix.
- The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, with speciation pending.
- The patient has altered mental status, which cannot be assessed at the moment due to sedation.
- The patient is past the withdrawal window for alcohol detoxification but is lethargic from a large valium dose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, with a goal oxygen saturation >93%. Frequent suctioning and pulmonary toilet should be performed. VAP bundle should be continued.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension following Lasix administration. There may be an element of sepsis due to GPC bacteremia. Other possible causes include being intubated with PEEP of 10 and aggressive bagging prior to intubation. Monitoring of blood"

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and sedated. Found to have
   b/l PE, s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt currently being
   treated for suspected aspiration PNA. [**Month (only) 8**] also be fluid overloaded but
   given PE
s, pt is preload dependent and blood pressure dropped with
   Lasix
   - Hold diuresis for today
   - cont Zosyn for aspiration PNA
   - heparin drip for PE
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean propofol to better assess pt
s mental status and avoid
   over sedation; avoid versed as pt may still have benzo overdose
   although last valium dose was [**9-10**].
   - sputum cx
   - cont to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Hypotension
 likely in setting of likely PE. Pt had episodes of
   Hypotension following Lasix and received fluid with subsequent stable
   SBPs.  Pt with GPC positive BCx so may be element of sepsis. Other
   possible causes can be due to being intubated with a PEEP of 10.
   -assess BP on PEEP 5
   - continue vanco for GPC bacteremia pending speciation
   - continue to monitor BP
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable with no new episodes of bleeding. Pt had
   bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment.  Bleeding
   likely secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior
   to intubation.  Patient is safe to receive heparin.
   -ENT to re-evaluate pt today
 will f/u with them.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Unable to assess right now as patient is
   sedated.  Reportedly pt has been somnolent throughout floor stay. He
   did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose
   [**9-10**]. CT-head was negative.
   - wean propofol as tolerated to try to assess mental status time to
   time
   -Blood tox to evaluate if benzo
s are still present in blood
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Currently
   lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
 change to PO as pt has OG tube
   - Social work following

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, currently admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is intubated and sedated, and found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) and is now on a heparin drip. The patient is also being treated for suspected aspiration pneumonia (PNA). He is preload dependent and has experienced hypotension after Lasix administration, which was treated with fluid resuscitation. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to sedation from propofol and a possible benzodiazepine overdose. The patient has positive gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the blood culture, indicating possible sepsis. Other possible causes of hypotension include the setting of likely PE, being intubated with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10, and potential septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and has bilateral PE. He is being treated for suspected aspiration PNA and fluid overload. Close monitoring of respiratory status with a goal oxygen saturation (O2) >93% is essential. Frequent suctioning and pulmonary toileting should be continued, along with weaning off propofol to better assess mental"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage in one or more arteries in the lungs. This condition can lead to difficulty breathing, chest pain, and low oxygen levels.

2. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to encephalopathy or sedation. This can cause confusion, disorientation, and difficulty in following commands.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder characterized by irregular and often rapid heart rate. This can lead to palpitations, dizziness, and an increased risk of blood clots.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is suffering from acute respiratory failure, which means the lungs are not providing enough oxygen to the body or removing enough carbon dioxide. This can result in shortness of breath, bluish discoloration of the skin, and fatigue.

5. Inability to protect airway: The patient has an inability to protect their airway, putting them at risk for aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration occurs when foreign material enters the lungs, leading to infection and potential respiratory complications.

6. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which is low blood pressure. This can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs and"

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and sedated. Found to have
   b/l PE, s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt currently being
   treated for suspected aspiration PNA. [**Month (only) 8**] also be fluid overloaded but
   given PE
s, pt is preload dependent and blood pressure dropped with
   Lasix
   - Hold diuresis for today
   - cont Zosyn for aspiration PNA
   - heparin drip for PE
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean propofol to better assess pt
s mental status and avoid
   over sedation; avoid versed as pt may still have benzo overdose
   although last valium dose was [**9-10**].
   - sputum cx
   - cont to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Hypotension
 likely in setting of likely PE. Pt had episodes of
   Hypotension following Lasix and received fluid with subsequent stable
   SBPs.  Pt with GPC positive BCx so may be element of sepsis. Other
   possible causes can be due to being intubated with a PEEP of 10.
   -assess BP on PEEP 5
   - continue vanco for GPC bacteremia pending speciation
   - continue to monitor BP
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable with no new episodes of bleeding. Pt had
   bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment.  Bleeding
   likely secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior
   to intubation.  Patient is safe to receive heparin.
   -ENT to re-evaluate pt today
 will f/u with them.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Unable to assess right now as patient is
   sedated.  Reportedly pt has been somnolent throughout floor stay. He
   did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose
   [**9-10**]. CT-head was negative.
   - wean propofol as tolerated to try to assess mental status time to
   time
   -Blood tox to evaluate if benzo
s are still present in blood
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Currently
   lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
 change to PO as pt has OG tube
   - Social work following

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and later diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism, for which he received tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) treatment and is now on a heparin drip. The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to respiratory failure caused by a suspected aspiration pneumonia. He also has altered mental status, possibly due to benzodiazepine overdose, and is being treated for aspiration pneumonia with Zosyn.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Bleeding: The patient has received tPa treatment, which carries a risk of bleeding. However, no new episodes of bleeding have been reported since the treatment.

3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension following Lasix administration and received fluids to maintain stable blood pressure. There is a risk of recurrent hypotension, especially in the setting of likely pulmonary embolism.

4. Infection: The patient has suspected aspiration pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of new infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history"

   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and sedated, maintained on
   AC.  Found to have b/l PE on CTA, s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin
   drip.  Pt is also currently being treated for suspected aspiration
   PNA.  Also on the differential is volume overload.   Yesterday patient
   would derecruit and desaturated with small decreases of PEEP.  If
   patient had more PE
s, would not see this pattern of derecruitment
   following decreasing PEEP.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate lung parenchyma for reasons why patient
   derecruits when PEEP is decreased
   - Possible bronchoscopy today pending chest CT findings
   - Hold diuresis today  for hypotension
   - cont Zosyn for aspiration PNA
   - heparin drip for PE
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean sedation to better assess pt
s mental status and avoid
   over sedation; avoid versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even
   though last valium dose was [**9-10**].
   - f/u sputum cx
   - cont to trend WBC and fever curve

   # Hypotension
 likely in setting of PE. Pt had episodes of Hypotension
   following Lasix and received fluid with subsequent stable SBPs.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   have element of sepsis since GPC
s found on BCx. Other possible causes
   can be due to being intubated with a PEEP of 10.
   - continue vanco for GPC bacteremia pending speciation
   - continue to monitor BP

   # Bleeding
 Hct stable with no new episodes of bleeding. Pt had
   bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment.  Bleeding
   likely secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior
   to intubation.  Patient is safe to receive heparin.

   #. Change in Mental Status: Unable to assess right now as patient is
   sedated.  Reportedly pt has been somnolent throughout floor stay. He
   did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose
   [**9-10**]. CT-head was negative.
   - try to wean sedation to better assess pt

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism on CT angiography, for which he received tissue plasminogen activator treatment and is now on heparin drip. The patient also has respiratory failure, currently intubated and sedated, and is being treated for suspected aspiration pneumonia. There is evidence of volume overload, as shown by the presence of bibasilar crackles on lung examination and a high fluid balance.

The patient's mental status has been altered throughout the hospital stay, possibly due to benzodiazepine overdose, as evidenced by positive urine and blood tests for benzodiazepines. The patient has also had episodes of hypotension following diuretic administration, which were managed with fluid resuscitation. There is ongoing concern for bleeding complications, especially given the recent use of tissue plasminogen activator, but the patient's hematocrit levels have remained stable with no new episodes of bleeding.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with diltiazem and metoprolol, and it is noted that he would benefit from long-term anticoagulation therapy, but this will be delayed until the acute setting is resolved. The patient's recent change in mental status cannot be fully assessed due to sedation, but there is a plan to wean"

   ====================
   Patient continues to have episodes of hypoxemia, temporally associated
   with drops in PEEP. Not clear why he should be PEEP sensitive at this
   point. His CXR has not been impressive for parenchymal abnormalities.
   We will obtain a Chest CT today to assess the parenchyma more closely.
   If there is not a significant alveolar process, will consider a bronch
   to remove mucus plugs. If bronch is unimpressive for secretions,
   consider repeat LENI's; he may be throwing additional emboli if clot
   still present.
   Hct stable. No evidence of significant bleeding. Continues on heparin.
   Heart rate reasonably controlled on heparin.
   Mental status may be a bit better today; opens his eyes to command. Try
   to wean sedation today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, and altered mental status. The patient's oxygenation has been intermittent, with a fever of 101.4 last night. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood pressure is 131/88 mmHg, heart rate is 116 beats per minute, and temperature is 38.4°C (101.1°F). The patient has right and left lower extremity edema, and their mental status has shown some improvement today, with the patient opening their eyes to command. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not properly managed.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a confirmed pulmonary embolism, which can lead to further complications such as right ventricular strain, hypotension, and even sudden cardiac arrest.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and there is a need for ongoing neurological assessment. The cause of the altered mental status could be due to various factors including hypoxemia, sepsis, or the effects of sedation.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia"

   .
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and sedated, maintained on
   AC with no changes to vent last night.  Found to have b/l PE on CTA,
   s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt is also currently being
   treated for suspected aspiration PNA.  Also on the differential is
   volume overload.
   -
   - Hold diuresis today  for hypotension
   - cont Zosyn for aspiration PNA
   - heparin drip for PE
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean sedation to better assess pt
s mental status and avoid
   over sedation; avoid versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even
   though last valium dose was [**9-10**].
   - f/u sputum cx
   - cont to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Fever
 pt with continued fever despite negative cultures. [**Month (only) 8**] be due
   to aspiration PNA.
   -continue zosyn
   -LFTs to evaluate for possible ICU cholecystits
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol
   .
   # Hypotension
 BP stable 100s-140s overnight. Likely in setting of PE.
   Pt had episodes of Hypotension following Lasix and received fluid with
   subsequent stable SBPs.  GPCs in [**9-17**] culture most likely contamination
   so sepsis unlikely.  Other possible causes can be due to being
   intubated with a PEEP of 10.
   - d/c vanco
   - continue to monitor BP
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable slightly decreased and 100cc blood suctuned
   yesterday. Had scant amount of bleeding from nose last night per NSG
   notes. ENT re-consulted but did not hear back. Pt had bleeding from
   anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation.  Patient is safe to receive heparin.
   -continue to monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Unable to assess right now as patient is
   sedated.  Reportedly pt has been somnolent throughout floor stay. He
   did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose
   [**9-10**]. CT-head was negative.
   - try to wean sedation to better assess pt
s mental status, hopefully
   decrease agitation
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Currently
   lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification.
- He has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation (AF), altered mental status, and potential aspiration pneumonia (PNA).
- The patient is currently intubated and sedated, receiving mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O.
- He is on a heparin drip for treatment of PE and is also being treated for suspected aspiration PNA.
- The patient has ongoing fever despite negative cultures, which may be due to aspiration PNA.
- His blood pressure is stable in the 100s-140s range, likely due to PE.
- The patient has a history of bleeding from the nose and anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment.
- He has new-onset atrial fibrillation on admission, controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol.
- The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to benzodiazepine overdose.
- He is being weaned off sedation to assess mental status.
- The patient is past the withdrawal window for alcohol detoxification.
- His nutritional support includes receiving Nutren Pulmonary at 60 mL/hour.

   =====================
   Oxygenation a bit worse following BAL/bronchoscopy. FIO2 now down to
   40% today; PEEP reduced to 8. Propofol turned off to reassess his
   mental status and his ability provide his own respiratory needs.
   Clinically, it appears that the clot has been very slow to clear
   despite TPA. Would consider checking anti-thrombin III level.
   Hct is drifing down. Not at transfusion threshold.
   Continues to be febrile. Recheck LFTs for possible acalculous
   cholecystitis. Awaiting PCP results from BAL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, altered mental status, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypotension. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and is experiencing moderate bleeding from the nose. They have been hemodynamically stable and have developed fever. The patient is unable to provide their own medical history due to encephalopathy and intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and worsening respiratory status could indicate the development of pneumonia, which is a common complication in critically ill patients, especially those with mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure and diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. ARDS is a severe lung condition characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs.
3. Sepsis: The presence of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and altered mental status may suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening complication of infection that can lead to multiple organ dysfunction.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient already has a confirmed diagnosis of PE, which is a blockage of an artery in the lungs usually caused by a blood clot. This condition can worsen over time and potentially lead to further complications.
5. Bleeding: The patient's moderate bleeding from the nose after bronchoscopy needs to be monitored closely"

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and sedated, maintained on
   AC with no changes to vent last night.  Found to have b/l PE on CTA,
   s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt is also currently being
   treated for suspected aspiration PNA.  Also on the differential is
   volume overload.   FiO2 decreased today to 40% and PEEP to 8.
   - Hold diuresis today  for hypotension
   - cont Zosyn for aspiration PNA
   - heparin drip for PE
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean sedation to better assess pt
s mental status and avoid
   over sedation; avoid versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even
   though last valium dose was [**9-10**].

   # Hypotension
BP stable 100s-140s. Likely in setting of PE. Pt had
   episodes of hypotension following Lasix and received fluid with
   subsequent stable SBPs.  GPCs in [**9-17**] culture most likely contamination
   so sepsis less likely. Other possible causes can be due to being
   intubated with a PEEP of 10.
   - d/c vancomycin
   - continue to monitor BP
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct slightly decreased and 100cc blood suctioned
   yesterday. Continues to have oozing from nose. Pt had bleeding from
   anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation.  Patient is safe to receive heparin. Clot has been slow to
   clear
   -Anti-thrombin III sent
   -ENT re-consulted
   -Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Unable to assess right now as patient is
   sedated.  Reportedly pt has been somnolent throughout floor stay. He
   did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose
   [**9-10**]. CT-head was negative.
   - try to wean sedation to better assess pt
s mental status, hopefully
   decrease agitation
   - benzos still positive in blood and urine
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Currently
   lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He has several ongoing medical complications and conditions, including respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and epistaxis (nosebleed). 

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with mechanical ventilation support. He has been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) followed by heparin drip. There are suspicions of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and possible PCP infection. 

His vital signs indicate an elevated temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 81 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 111/61 mmHg to 159/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 24 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Other"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, currently in the ICU for ethanol detoxification. He has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, bilateral pulmonary embolism (s/p tPA treatment), and suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient is intubated and sedated, maintained on assisted controlled ventilation with FiO2 decreased to 40% and PEEP to 8. He is also being treated for volume overload. The patient's recent events include a middle turbinate bleed, bloody urine episode, and episodes of hypotension. His vital signs show a fever, elevated heart rate, and blood pressure in the 100s-140s. His laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and prolonged partial thromboplastin time. The patient has several pending cultures and is receiving multiple medications, including heparin, propofol, furosemide, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and sedated, indicating respiratory failure. The goal is to maintain an oxygen saturation of >93% and wean sedation to better assess mental status.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has bilateral pulmonary embolism, which is being treated with heparin. Close monitoring for respiratory status is necessary.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was intubated due to hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypoxia, and delirium. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/81 mmHg to 159/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and slightly low platelet count of 354 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's urine culture showed the presence of staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and gram-negative bacteria, both of which are covered with antibiotics. However, the patient's fever curve is not trending down, indicating ongoing infection.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible propofol infusion syndrome. The plan is to lighten sedation and transition to pressure support ventilation with a PEEP of 10.

The patient has been experiencing various medical complications including fever, acute hypoxia during movement, thick secretions, atrial fibrillation, epistaxis, hematuria, and delirium. He has received multiple medications and interventions to manage these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for pressure support and adjusting PEEP levels to optimize oxygenation.
2. Fever: Despite negative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and coverage for suspected infections, the patient's fever curve is not trending down. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the fever.
3. Propofol Infusion Syndrome: The patient's long-term sedation with propofol raises the risk of propofol infusion syndrome. Checking CK levels is recommended to evaluate for this condition.
4. Hematuria: Ongoing heparin infusion may be causing hematuria. Urine sediment should be evaluated for evidence of embolic disease.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: Rate control is necessary for the patient's atrial fibrillation, and its relationship to PE or alcohol withdrawal needs to be assessed.
6. Delirium: The patient had"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted with ethanol withdrawal and subsequently developed bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) leading to hemodynamic compromise. The patient underwent thrombolysis and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's recent events include the development of acute hypoxia during movement, which responded to increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2). The patient also has a fever and thick secretions. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.9°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/81 to 159/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has atrial fibrillation and an elevated central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a total intake of 3,801 mL and a total output of 2,050 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,751 mL. The patient is receiving heparin sodium, propofol, and furosemide infusions. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin at 10.5 g/dL, elevated potassium levels of 3.7 mEq/L, and decreased bicarbonate levels"

   Pt had episodes of hypotension following Lasix and received fluid with
   subsequent stable SBPs.  GPCs in [**9-17**] culture most likely contamination

   # Bleeding
 Hct slightly decreased likely secondary to hematuria and
   nose bleeds. Continues to have oozing from nose. Pt had bleeding from
   anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation. Clot has been slow to clear.  Now with hematuria.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has been treated for suspected aspiration pneumonia, sparse growth MSSA and Klebsiella in sputum cultures, and pulmonary embolism with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) treatment. He also has ongoing issues with fever, hypotension, bleeding, atrial fibrillation, change in mental status, and alcohol detoxification.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and sedated, maintained on assisted controlled ventilation (AC) after experiencing tachypnea on CPAP trial. He has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and is on heparin drip. There is also a suspicion of aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring for respiratory status with a goal oxygen saturation >93% is planned.
2. Bleeding: The patient has ongoing oozing from the nose and had an episode of bloody urine. His Hct is slightly decreased, indicating potential blood loss. Anti-thrombin III levels are pending.
3. Fever: The patient continues to have a fever despite negative cultures except for sparse growth MSSA and Klebsiella in sputum. Aspiration pneumonia or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) are considered possibilities."

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, suspected aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, altered mental status, and electrolyte/fluid disorder.

The patient is intubated and sedated, maintained on assisted control ventilation after experiencing tachypnea in the 40s on CPAP. He has bilateral pulmonary embolism, which was treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) and is currently on heparin drip. The patient also has suspected aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by sparse growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Klebsiella in the sputum culture.

The patient's fever persists despite negative cultures except for MSSA and Klebsiella. There are no signs of acalculous cholecystitis on liver function tests. Propofol infusion syndrome is also on the differential, and the patient's creatine kinase (CK) level should be evaluated for this condition.

The patient's blood pressure has improved and is now stable in the 100s-140s. Hypotension may be related to pulmonary embolism. Vancomycin was discontinued due to possible contamination in the blood culture.

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and sedated, maintained on
   AC after tachypnea to 40s on CPAP 12/5 trial yesterday.  Found to have
   b/l PE on CTA, s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt is also
   currently being treated for suspected aspiration PNA with sputum cx
   showing sparse MSSA and Klebsiella.  Also on the differential is volume
   overload.   Plan to wean to CPAP/PS 15/10 today to see how he does.
   - cont Zosyn for aspiration PNA
   - heparin drip for PE
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean sedation to better assess pt
s mental status and avoid
   over sedation; avoid versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even
   though last valium dose was [**9-10**].
   - cont to trend WBC and fever curve
   -HIV status: PCP emailed to determine if it has been discussed
   .
   # Fever
 Pt with continued fever despite negative cultures except
   sparse growth MSSA and Klebsiella in sputum. No signs of acalculous
   chole on LFTs.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to aspiration PNA or PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] on the
   differential is propofol infusion syndrome.
   -continue zosyn
   -f/u cultures
   -check CK to eval for propofol infusion syndrome
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Hypotension
Improved.  BP stable 100s-140s. Likely in setting of PE.
   Pt had episodes of hypotension following Lasix and received fluid with
   subsequent stable SBPs.  GPCs in [**9-17**] culture most likely contamination
   so sepsis less likely. Other possible causes can be due to being
   intubated with a PEEP of 10.
   - d/c vancomycin
   - continue to monitor BP
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct slightly decreased likely secondary to hematuria and
   nose bleeds. Continues to have oozing from nose. Pt had bleeding from
   anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation. Clot has been slow to clear.  Now with hematuria.
   -ENT saw L middle turbinate bleed - they packed it. If rebleeds, give 3
   sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If continues to bleed, call
   ENT.
   - check U/A for sediment to eval for kidney thrombi
   -Monitor Hct
   -f/u Anti thrombin III (ordered given pt slow to clear clot)
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Unable to assess right now as patient is
   sedated.  Reportedly pt has been somnolent throughout floor stay. He
   did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose
   [**9-10**]. CT-head was negative.
   - try to wean sedation to better assess pt
s mental status, hopefully
   decrease agitation
   - benzos still positive in blood and urine
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
 change to PO as pt has OG tube
   - Social work following
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU for now.  Will wake up and perform neuro exam today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography (CTA), which was treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa). He is currently intubated and sedated on mechanical ventilation (MV) due to respiratory failure. The patient also has a suspected aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with sparse growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Klebsiella in sputum cultures. He has been on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for aspiration PNA and heparin drip for pulmonary embolism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and sedated on MV due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status with the goal of maintaining oxygen saturation >93% is necessary. Weaning to CPAP/PS 15/10 should be attempted to assess his progress. Frequent suctioning and pulmonary toilets should be performed, and volume overload should be closely monitored.

2. Fever: The patient has a continued fever despite negative cultures except for sparse growth MSSA and Klebsiella in sputum. No signs of acalculous cholecystitis are observed on liver function tests."

   -ENT saw L middle turbinate bleed - they packed it. If rebleeds, give 3
   sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If continues to bleed, call
   ENT.
   - check U/A for sediment to eval for kidney thrombi
   -Monitor Hct
   -f/u Anti thrombin III
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Unable to assess right now as patient is
   sedated.  Reportedly pt has been somnolent throughout floor stay. He
   did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose
   [**9-10**]. CT-head was negative.
   - try to wean propofol to better assess pt
s mental status, hopefully
   decrease agitation
   - benzos still positive in blood and urine
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
 change to PO as pt has OG tube
   - Social work following

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, aspiration pneumonia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, and nosebleeds. He is currently intubated and sedated, receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. His temperature is 101.4°F, blood pressure is 134/79 mmHg, heart rate is 104 bpm, and oxygen saturation is 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has bilateral pulmonary embolism as seen on CT angiography. There is a risk of recurrent embolism or development of further complications such as pulmonary hypertension.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has suspected aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening lung infection and respiratory distress.
4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance and fluid disorder, which can affect various organ functions and contribute to complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure
 didn
t tolerate pressure support last night but
   extremely PEEP sensitive by history.  Plan to wake up today.  Now on
   slightly higher PEEP of 12 which we will try to decrease 10.    Cont
   diuresis.
   Fever- BAL negative from [**9-20**].  Sputum staph aureus (MSSA) and gram neg
   but both covered.  Continues to be febrile but without clear source.
   Bili nl so acalculous cholecystitis less likely.  CKs neg, bp stable,
   nl renal fxn so propofol infusion syndrome unlikely.    Completed 8
   days for presumed VAP.  Will d/c antibiotics.
   Epistaxis- Appreciate ENT input.  Now w/ posterior nasal packing
   Hematuria- Likely [**3-12**] ongoing heparin infusion.  Check urine sediment
   to eval for evidence of embolic dz.
   Atrial fibrillation - ? if related to PE given present on admission
   (vs. alcohol).  Rate control.
   Delerium-  Previously had been delirious on floor, plan to awake and
   evaluate today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male admitted with alcohol withdrawal and subsequently developed bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) after fibrinolysis. The patient's current condition includes fever, inability to tolerate pressure support due to tachypnea, and ongoing heparin infusion. The patient has also been diagnosed with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there are further issues with oxygenation or ventilation.
2. PE complications: The presence of bilateral PE increases the risk of further embolic events, which may lead to organ damage or failure.
3. Heparin infusion complications: The ongoing heparin infusion increases the risk of bleeding, such as epistaxis (nosebleed), and the patient already has hematuria, which could be related to the heparin infusion.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, leading to increased confusion and agitation.
5. Fever of unknown origin: The persistent fever without a clear source requires further investigation to identify the underlying cause.

Overall, the patient's ICU stay is complicated by various conditions and potential complications. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential to prevent further deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol withdrawal, who was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) following fibrinolysis. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachypnea, and is intubated due to respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 550 mL, RR set at 20, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and spontaneous ventilation rate of 3 breaths per minute. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but he has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.1 K/uL. His platelet count is slightly low at 354 K/uL. The patient has elevated lactate levels and low albumin levels. He has been febrile with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, and has not tolerated pressure support due to tachypnea. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is minimally responsive off sedation. He also has atrial fibrillation, which is being rate-controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as he is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. Given"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted with alcohol withdrawal symptoms and subsequently diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) following fibrinolysis therapy. The patient developed a fever, which is currently ongoing, and did not tolerate pressure support due to tachypnea. He is intubated and currently on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 550 mL. His oxygen saturation is 95% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient has been on lasix and heparin infusions, as well as propofol for sedation. He has a history of alcohol abuse and previous episodes of atrial fibrillation. The patient's blood cultures were negative, ruling out bacterial infection as the cause of fever. There is no evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Other medical issues include epistaxis, hematuria, altered mental status, and electrolyte imbalance. The patient's family has been updated on his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to bilateral PE and mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and there is a risk of developing further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin: The persistent fever without a clear source could indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying condition."

   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
   right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
   with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid
   regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is a small
   pericardial effusion. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
   absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures. There is
   significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid
   valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
   .
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-17**], a small
   pericardial effusion is now seen. This is located anterior to the right
   ventricle. There is respiratory variation in the mitral inflow,
   suggesting impaired LV filling. However, this could be due to the
   dilated, hypokinetic RV. There is no evidence of RA or RV collapse,
   however echo signs of tamponade may be absent when the RA and RV
   pressures are elevated.

   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and slightly sedated.  Did
   well on CPAP/PS [**1-17**]
 decreased to [**11-12**] today during rounds.  Found
   to have b/l PE on CTA, s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt
   completed vanc/zosyn abx course for aspiration PNA.  Also on the
   differential is volume overload.
   - wean PEEP as tolerated with SBT
 barriers to weaning include
   muscle weakness from prolonged period on vent (may need spring/rest SBT
   trials prior to extubation), inability to clear secretions depending on
   mental status, fluid overload.
   - heparin drip for PE
   -diurese 1L negative; do not diurese too much as pt has limited RV
   function
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean propofol  to better assess pt
s mental status; avoid
   versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even though last valium dose
   was [**9-10**].
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis.
   -If BP decreases, do not give fluids as this can cause RV to dilate
   further and impair what function is there.
   -If BP decreases, will need to start dobuatine or milronone.
   -Cardiology consulted
   -Gently diurese
 no more than 1L negative today
   .
   # Fever
 Pt with continued fever despite negative cultures except
   sparse growth MSSA and Klebsiella in sputum. No signs of acalculous
   chole on LFTs.  Antibiotics course for aspiration PNA completed. Also
   on the differential is propofol infusion syndrome.
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable although pt has hematuria and nose bleeds. Nose
   now packed. Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during tPa
   treatment.  Bleeding likely secondary to trauma sustained during
   aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.  Hematuria persists
   attributed to trauma from prior foley administration. Clot has been
   slow to clear.
   -ENT saw L middle turbinate bleed - they packed it. If rebleeds, give 3
   sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If continues to bleed, call
   ENT.
   - check U/A for sediment to eval for kidney thrombi
   -Monitor Hct
   -f/u Anti thrombin III
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control
   was in NSR overnight, with A-flutter on telemetry this AM. CHADS-2
   score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term thromboembolic
   ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation. Unable to
   assess right now as patient is sedated.  He did receive >400mg valium
   in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head was negative.
   - try to wean propofol to better assess pt
s mental status, hopefully
   decrease agitation
   - U-tox today to determine if benzos still present.
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
 change to PO as pt has OG tube
   - Social work following

   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and sedated.  Failed trial
   of PS at 15/10, PEEP was increased to 12.  Found to have b/l PE on CTA,
   s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt is also currently being
   treated for suspected aspiration PNA with sputum cx showing sparse MSSA
   and Klebsiella.  Also on the differential is volume overload.   Plan to
   wean to CPAP/PS 15/10 today to see how he does.
   - wean PEEP as tolerated down to 10
   - discontinue zosyn
   - heparin drip for PE
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean propofol  to better assess pt
s mental status; avoid
   versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even though last valium dose
   was [**9-10**].
   - cont to trend WBC and fever curve
   - diurese as tolerated

   # Fever
 Pt with continued fever despite negative cultures except
   sparse growth MSSA and Klebsiella in sputum. No signs of acalculous
   chole on LFTs.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to aspiration PNA or PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] on the
   differential is propofol infusion syndrome.
   -d/c zosyn
 has been adequately treated, continued use of medications
   could be a possible source of fever.
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Hypotension
 Resolved.  BP stable 100s-140s. Likely in setting of
   PE. Pt had episodes of hypotension following Lasix and received fluid
   with subsequent stable SBPs.  GPCs in [**9-17**] culture most likely
   contamination so sepsis less likely. Other possible causes can be due
   to being intubated with a PEEP of 10.
   - continue to monitor BP
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct slightly decreased likely secondary to hematuria and
   nose bleeds. Continues to have oozing from nose. Pt had bleeding from
   anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation. Clot has been slow to clear.  Now with hematuria.
   -ENT saw L middle turbinate bleed - they packed it. If rebleeds, give 3
   sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If continues to bleed, call
   ENT.
   - check U/A for sediment to eval for kidney thrombi
   -Monitor Hct
   -f/u Anti thrombin III
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Unable to assess right now as patient is
   sedated.  Reportedly pt has been somnolent throughout floor stay. He
   did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose
   [**9-10**]. CT-head was negative.
   - try to wean propofol to better assess pt
s mental status, hopefully
   decrease agitation
   - benzos still positive in blood and urine
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
 change to PO as pt has OG tube
   - Social work following

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to acute respiratory failure. He has been treated for suspected aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with sputum cultures showing sparse MSSA and Klebsiella. The patient also has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), which was treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa). He is on a heparin drip for PE and being weaned to CPAP/PS 15/10 to assess his respiratory status.

2. Fever: The patient continues to have a fever despite negative cultures except for sparse growth MSSA and Klebsiella in the sputum. Possible causes of fever include aspiration PNA, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), or propofol infusion syndrome. Cultures will be followed up, and Tylenol will be given for fever.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, with stable blood pressures in the 100s-140s. It is likely due to PE. The patient had episodes of hypotension following Lasix administration but received fluids with subsequent stable systolic blood pressures. GPCs in the culture on 9/17"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including sedation,
   volume-overload, perhaps component of pulmonary embolism/atalectasis.
   Somewhat PEEP sensitive,may be related to volume expansion.  Plan to
   wake up today, continue diuresis (gently given prior RV dysfxn before
   lysis).  Trial of pressure support.
   FEVER -- improved.  Completed iv antibiotics for pneumonia (MSSA and
   GNR).  Continues to be febrile but without clear source.    Bili nl so
   acalculous cholecystitis less likely.  CKs neg, bp stable, nl renal fxn
   so propofol infusion syndrome unlikely.    Completed 8 days for
   presumed VAP.  Will d/c antibiotics.
   EPISTAXIS -- Appreciate ENT input.  Now w/ posterior nasal packing
   maintain.
   HEMATURIA -- likely Foley trauma in setting of heparin infusion.
   A-FIB -- possibly related to PE given present on admission (vs.
   alcohol).  Rate currently controlled.
   ALETERED MENTAL STATUS --   Attributable to slow clearance of
   benzodiazepienes.  Will plan to use propofol and continue daily wake
   up.  Monitor benzidiazepine periodically to monitor  clearance.
   ETOH AbUSE -- now out of risk for acute withdrawal.  Social service.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient has been intubated and sedated. The vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), blood pressure of 108/73 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's medical history includes ethanol abuse, but it is currently being managed. The patient's mental status is altered due to slow clearance of benzodiazepines, and they will be monitored periodically for clearance. The patient also has atrial flutter, which may be related to pulmonary embolism or alcohol use.

The patient has several other conditions, including fever that has improved after completing IV antibiotics for pneumonia, epistaxis (nosebleed) with posterior nasal packing maintained, hematuria likely due to Foley trauma while on heparin infusion, and altered mental status attributable to slow clearance of benzodiazepines.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The plan for the patient includes continuing diuresis, a trial of pressure support, discontinuing antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and daily wake-up calls. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is to remain in the ICU"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including sedation,
   volume-overload, perhaps component of pulmonary embolism/atalectasis.
   Somewhat PEEP sensitive,may be related to volume expansion.  Plan to
   wake up today, continue diuresis (gently given prior RV dysfxn before
   lysis).  Trial of pressure support.
   FEVER -- improved.  Completed iv antibiotics for pneumonia (MSSA and
   GNR).  Continues to be febrile but without clear source.    Bili nl so
   acalculous cholecystitis less likely.  CKs neg, bp stable, nl renal fxn
   so propofol infusion syndrome unlikely.    Completed 8 days for
   presumed VAP.  Will d/c antibiotics.
   EPISTAXIS -- Appreciate ENT input.  Now w/ posterior nasal packing
   HEMATURIA -- likely Foley trauma in setting of heparin infusion.
   A-FIB -- possibly related to PE given present on admission (vs.
   alcohol).  Rate currently controlled.
   ALETERED MENTAL STATUS --   Attributable to slow clearance of
   benzodiazepienes.  Will plan to use propofol and continue daily wake
   up.  Monitor benzidiazepine periodically to monitor  clearance.
   ETOH AbUSE -- now out of risk for acute withdrawal.  Social service.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 108/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter. The patient is receiving multiple infusions including furosemide, propofol, and heparin.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and no signs of overweight or obesity. The patient has an endotracheal tube in place and no NG or OG tubes. The cardiovascular examination shows normal PMI, S1, S2 sounds, and no murmurs. The respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. The extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination shows the patient attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 369 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, total CO2 of 28 mEq/L, glucose of 122 mg/dL, and sodium of 134 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The assessment and plan include persistent respiratory failure, improved fever, completion of antibiotics for pneumonia, consideration for pressure support, likely Foley trauma causing hematuria, controlled atrial fibrillation rate, altered mental status due to benzodiazepine clearance, and ongoing monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing persistent respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient has completed antibiotics, there is still a risk of pneumonia due to the invasive nature of mechanical ventilation.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's symptoms could be related to a pulmonary embolism, especially given the presence of atrial fibrillation.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates potential kidney dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by hypoperfusion or medication toxicity.
5. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin, an anticoagulant, which increases the risk of bleeding. The presence of hematuria suggests possible Foley catheter trauma.
6. Withdrawal syndrome: The patient is critically ill and may be at risk for benzodiazepine or ethanol withdrawal.
7. Infection: Despite completing antibiotics, the patient is still febrile without a clear source, suggesting a possible ongoing infection.
8. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed"

   -Echo shows pericardial effusion, severe RV dilatation and hypokinesis.
   Cards consulted.
   -CARDS: Goal would be to redistribute tissue fluid overload with
   ongoing diuresis without significantly decreasing his CVP, as he
   likely needs high-normal right-sided filling pressures to
   maintain his cardiac output in face of submassive pulmonary
   emboli.  If hypotensive and CVP in a reasonable range, DO NOT GIVE
   FLUIDS. Would repeat ECHO (to rule out tamponade given small effusion)
   and (assuming negative) consider positive inotropes (dobutamine
   or dopamine would be reasonable choices) in hopes of augmenting
   RV contractility.

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and more alert. Pt did well
   on CPAP/PS yesterday but then became suddenly hypoxic and was noted to
   have increased secretions yesterday. He still has difficultly clearing
   secretions and tends to derecruit. This may be due to fluid,
   atelectasis or secretions.  Found to have b/l PE on CTA, s/p tPa
   treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt completed vanc/zosyn abx course for
   aspiration PNA but may have new VAP (see below). Also pt is still
   volume overloaded on exam.
   - wean PEEP as tolerated with SBT
 barriers to weaning include
   muscle weakness from prolonged period on vent (may need spring/rest SBT
   trials prior to extubation), inability to clear secretions depending on
   mental status, fluid overload.
   - heparin drip for PE
   -diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP 5-9. Do not diurese too
   much as pt has limited RV function. Goal -1L today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean propofol  to better assess pt
s mental status; avoid
   versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even though last valium dose
   was [**9-10**].
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis.
   -If BP decreases, call Cardiology for stat ECHO to evaluate for
   potential tamponade. Do not give fluids as this can cause RV to dilate
   further and impair what function is there.  Will need to start
   dobuatine or milronone.
   -Appreciate cardiology recs
 will follow up
   -Gently diurese
 keep CVP 5-9.
   .
   # Fever
 Pt with continued fever. Last sputum cultures demonstrated
   MSSA and pan sensitive Klebsiella in sputum. No signs of acalculous
   chole on LFTs.  Antibiotics course for aspiration PNA completed, but pt
   may have developed new VAP given prolonged period on ventilator. Also
   on the differential is propofol infusion syndrome.
   -Will hold on abx pending culture results
   -Send new sputum cx
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable although pt has hematuria and nose bleeds. Nose
   now packed. Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during tPa
   treatment.  Bleeding likely secondary to trauma sustained during
   aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.  Hematuria persists
   attributed to trauma from prior foley administration. Clot has been
   slow to clear.
   -ENT saw L middle turbinate bleed - they packed it. If rebleeds, give 3
   sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If continues to bleed, call
   ENT.
   - check U/A for sediment to eval for kidney thrombi
 if unable to add
   on to yesterday
s urine, resend urine with override.
   -Monitor Hct
   -f/u Anti thrombin III
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on
   admission. Placed back on dilt PO and metoprolol with good control
   was in NSR overnight, with A-flutter with HR to 140s on telemetry this
   AM. HR decreased after diltiazem dose. CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would
   benefit from ASA for long-term thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in
   acute setting.
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation. Unable to
   assess right now as patient is sedated.  He did receive >400mg valium
   in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head was negative.
   - try to wean propofol to better assess pt
s mental status
   - U-tox in a few days to determine if benzos still in system.
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
 change to PO as pt has OG tube
   - Social work following

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions including respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PS mode, but had to be switched back to assist-control (AC) mode due to hypoxia and inability to clear secretions. 

The patient's vital signs show a fever, with a maximum temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F) recorded today at 08:51 AM. Blood pressure readings are fluctuating, ranging from 103/62 mmHg to 96/58 mmHg. Heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 93 to 138 beats per minute. Respiratory rate is elevated at 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained above 99% on AC with FiO2 40% and PEEP 5.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL. Hemoglobin is 10.3 g/dL, and platelet count is 427 K/uL. Blood cultures have shown growth of MSSA and pan-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient's electrolytes and renal function tests are within normal limits.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2164-9-24**] 08:51 AM
 EKG - At [**2164-9-24**] 05:09 PM
   .
   -Echo shows pericardial effusion, severe RV dilatation and hypokinesis.
   Cards consulted.
   -CARDS: Goal would be to redistribute tissue fluid overload with
   ongoing diuresis without significantly decreasing his CVP, as he
   likely needs high-normal right-sided filling pressures to
   maintain his cardiac output in face of submassive pulmonary
   emboli.  If hypotensive and CVP in a reasonable range, DO NOT GIVE
   FLUIDS. Would repeat ECHO (to rule out tamponade given small effusion)
   and (assuming negative) consider positive inotropes (dobutamine
   or dopamine would be reasonable choices) in hopes of augmenting
   RV contractility.
   .
   -Vent: CPAP/PS: [**1-12**] with FiO2 40% at 2200. --> 15/5 b/c he was
   tachypneic on [**1-12**] --> switched to AC (550 x 16 at 50% and PEEP 10) and
   suctioned off lots of secretions (AC 7.50/41/66/33) --> Pt more

","Summary:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification.
- He presented with atrial fibrillation and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction.
- The patient has been intubated and sedated, and has developed fever, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.
- He also has evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), electrolyte and fluid disorder, and nosebleeds.
- The patient's current goals include weaning off sedation, reducing propofol, and assessing mental status.
- There are several potential medical complications that can arise, including respiratory failure due to muscle weakness and inability to clear secretions, RV dysfunction leading to decreased cardiac output, and bleeding due to trauma or coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient is currently intubated and sedated, which makes it difficult to assess his ability to protect his own airway.
   - He has muscle weakness from prolonged ventilation and inability to clear secretions.
   - Weaning off sedation and assessing his respiratory status will be crucial.

2. RV Dysfunction:
   - The patient has severe RV dilation with global free wall hypokinesis.
   - He has limited RV function, so diuresis should be carefully managed to avoid further RV dilation and impairment of cardiac output.
   - If the patient's blood pressure decreases, it is important not to give fluids as this can worsen"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2164-9-24**] 08:51 AM
 EKG - At [**2164-9-24**] 05:09 PM
   .
   -Echo shows pericardial effusion, severe RV dilatation and hypokinesis.
   Cards consulted.
   -CARDS: Goal would be to redistribute tissue fluid overload with
   ongoing diuresis without significantly decreasing his CVP, as he
   likely needs high-normal right-sided filling pressures to
   maintain his cardiac output in face of submassive pulmonary
   emboli.  If hypotensive and CVP in a reasonable range, DO NOT GIVE
   FLUIDS. Would repeat ECHO (to rule out tamponade given small effusion)
   and (assuming negative) consider positive inotropes (dobutamine
   or dopamine would be reasonable choices) in hopes of augmenting
   RV contractility.
   .
   -Vent: CPAP/PS: [**1-12**] with FiO2 40% at 2200. --> 15/5 b/c he was
   tachypneic on [**1-12**] --> switched to AC (550 x 16 at 50% and PEEP 10) and
   suctioned off lots of secretions (AC 7.50/41/66/33) --> Pt more
   comfortable.
   .
   -Currently on AC 550x 14 at 40% and PEEP 5. RR this AM was 40. RSBI not
   tried.
 Pt did not tolerate CPAP/PS [**11-17**] and is now back on AC.

   -Goal diuresis: -1L. At 2300, he was -1.5L. Lasix drip decreased to
   1mg/hr to maintain normal UOP but not dry him out given need to
   maintain adequate preload. CVP this AM around 5 (goal [**6-16**]) --> lasix
   stopped.

   on CPAP/PS yesterday but then became suddenly hypoxic and was noted to
   have increased secretions yesterday. He still has difficultly clearing
   secretions and tends to derecruit. This may be due to fluid,
   atelectasis or secretions.  Found to have b/l PE on CTA, s/p tPa

   aspiration PNA but may have new VAP (see below). Also pt is still
   volume overloaded on exam.
   - wean PEEP as tolerated with SBT
 barriers to weaning include
   muscle weakness from prolonged period on vent (may need spring/rest SBT
   trials prior to extubation), inability to clear secretions depending on
   mental status, fluid overload.
   - heparin drip for PE
   -diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP 5-9. Do not diurese too
   much as pt has limited RV function. Goal -1L today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean propofol  to better assess pt
s mental status; avoid

   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis.
   -If BP decreases, call Cardiology for stat ECHO to evaluate for
   potential tamponade. Do not give fluids as this can cause RV to dilate
   further and impair what function is there.  Will need to start
   dobuatine or milronone.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with right ventricular overload (RVO) on admission. The patient is currently intubated and more alert. He did well on CPAP/PS yesterday but then became suddenly hypoxic and was noted to have increased secretions yesterday. He still has difficulty clearing secretions and tends to derecruit. This may be due to fluid, atelectasis, or secretions. He has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA), and he received tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) treatment. He is now on a heparin drip.

The patient completed a vancomycin (VAN)/piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) antibiotic course for aspiration pneumonia but may have developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is still volume overloaded on examination. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated, and there are barriers to weaning due to muscle weakness, inability to clear secretions, and fluid overload.
2. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction: The patient has RV dilation with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is a need to monitor blood pressure, start dobutamine or milrinone if the blood pressure decreases, and avoid fluid administration.
3. Fever: The patient continues to have a fever, and the last sputum cultures demonstrated methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and pan-sensitive Klebsiella in the sputum. Antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia have been completed, but the patient may have developed new VAP. Propofol infusion syndrome should also be considered.
4. Bleeding: The patient has hematuria and nosebleeds, which are likely secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to intubation. The nosebleed has been packed, and the hematuria persists.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation on admission. He has been placed back on diltiazem PO and metoprolol with good control overnight. He was in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) but is now in atrial flutter on telemetry this morning. The CHADS-2 score is zero, and he would benefit from aspirin for long-term thromboembolic prophylaxis, but it will be held off in the acute setting.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including sedation,
   volume-overload, perhaps component of pulmonary embolism/atalectasis.
   Somewhat PEEP sensitive,may be related to volume expansion.  Plan to
   wake up today, continue diuresis (gently given prior RV dysfxn before
   lysis).  Trial of pressure support, hope to work towards extubation.
   THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE
 s/p lysis for severe clot burden, with some
   response.  Unclear as to whether there is component of chronicity to to
   pulmonary emboli.
   RV DYSFUNCTION
 Severe; attributed to pulmonary emboli, right outflow
   obstruction.  Severe dysfunction.  No echo evidence for resolution or
   recovery of RV function.  Uncertain as to nature of chronicity (ex.
   Chronic thromboembolic disease, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
   hypertension).
   FEVER -- improved.  Completed iv antibiotics for pneumonia (MSSA and
   GNR) --> completed 8 days for presumed VAP.  Monitor off antibiotics.
   EPISTAXIS -- Appreciate ENT input.  Now w/ posterior nasal packing
   maintain.
   HEMATURIA -- likely Foley trauma in setting of heparin infusion.
   A-FIB -- possibly related to PE given present on admission (vs.
   alcohol).  Rate currently controlled.
   ALETERED MENTAL STATUS --   Improved today, suspect slow clearance of
   benzodiazepines.  Monitor benzidiazepine periodically to monitor
   clearance.
   ETOH AbUSE -- now out of risk for acute withdrawal.  Social service.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, marked right ventricular (RV) dilation and dysfunction, and evidence of thromboembolic disease. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. The plan is to continue diuresis in an effort to offload the RV and wake up the patient today for a trial of pressure support, aiming towards extubation.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, altered mental status likely due to benzodiazepine use, and epistaxis. The patient's fever has improved after completing IV antibiotics for pneumonia and presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Hematuria is suspected to be caused by Foley trauma during heparin infusion. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which may be related to pulmonary embolism or alcohol use.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of RV function, recurrent VAP, and thromboembolic events. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including sedation,
   volume-overload, perhaps component of pulmonary embolism/atalectasis.
   Somewhat PEEP sensitive,may be related to volume expansion.  Plan to
   wake up today, continue diuresis (gently given prior RV dysfxn before
   lysis).  Trial of pressure support, hope to work towards extubation.
   THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE
 s/p lysis for severe clot burden, with some
   response.  Unclear as to whether there is component of chronicity to to
   pulmonary emboli.
   RV DYSFUNCTION
 Severe; attributed to pulmonary emboli, right outflow
   obstruction.  Severe dysfunction.  No echo evidence for resolution or
   recovery of RV function.  Uncertain as to nature of chronicity (ex.
   Chronic thromboembolic disease, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
   hypertension).
   FEVER -- improved.  Completed iv antibiotics for pneumonia (MSSA and
   GNR) --> completed 8 days for presumed VAP.  Monitor off antibiotics.
   EPISTAXIS -- Appreciate ENT input.  Now w/ posterior nasal packing
   maintain.
   HEMATURIA -- likely Foley trauma in setting of heparin infusion.
   A-FIB -- possibly related to PE given present on admission (vs.
   alcohol).  Rate currently controlled.
   ALETERED MENTAL STATUS --   Improved today, suspect slow clearance of
   benzodiazepines.  Monitor benzidiazepine periodically to monitor
   clearance.
   ETOH AbUSE -- now out of risk for acute withdrawal.  Social service.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. They have a history of severe right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and thromboembolic disease, for which they underwent lysis. The patient also has a fever that has improved, epistaxis, hematuria, atrial flutter, altered mental status, and a history of ethanol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may continue to be a concern. The cause is multifactorial and includes sedation, volume overload, and possibly pulmonary embolism/atalectasis.

2. Thromboembolic Disease: The patient has severe clot burden with some response to lysis. It is unclear whether there is a component of chronicity to the pulmonary emboli. This indicates the possibility of ongoing or recurrent thromboembolic events.

3. RV Dysfunction: The patient has severe right ventricular dysfunction, likely due to pulmonary emboli and right outflow obstruction. There is no evidence of resolution or recovery of RV function on echo.

4. Fever: Although the patient's fever has improved, it may indicate an ongoing infection or other underlying condition. Monitoring off antibiotics is recommended.

5. Epistaxis: The patient is experiencing epistaxis, which requires further evaluation and management. ENT input is appreciated, and the patient now has posterior nasal packing in place.

6. Hematuria: The patient likely"

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and more alert. Pt changed
   to CPAP/PS [**11-17**] yesterday and continued on this overnight. Found to
   have b/l PE on CTA, s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt
   completed vanc/zosyn abx course for aspiration PNA but may have new VAP
   (see below). Also pt is still volume overloaded on exam.
   - wean to PEEP 5- in past, pt has not been able to tolerate this and
   becomes tachypneic, most likely due to increased
   secretions/intermittent plugging. Barriers to weaning include muscle
   weakness from prolonged period on vent (may need spring/rest SBT trials
   prior to extubation), inability to clear secretions, fluid overload.
   - Consult IP regarding tracheostomy given prolonged ventilator course.
   Have discussed this with patient
   - heparin drip for PE
 PTT continues to be therapeutic
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP 5-9. Do not diurese too
   much as pt has limited RV function. Goal negative 500cc -1L today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   -If pt becomes tachypneic, suction secretions and increase PEEP instead
   of increasing sedation as pt does not appear to be agitated on vent.
   - attempt to keep propofol off and control pain with fentanyl; avoiding
   versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even though last valium dose
   was [**9-10**].
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis due to Right heart strain due to PE.
   -If BP decreases (MAP<60), call Cardiology for stat ECHO to evaluate
   for potential tamponade. Do not give fluids as this can cause RV to
   dilate further and impair what function is there.  Will need to start
   dobuatine or milronone.
   -Appreciate cardiology recs
 will follow up
   -Gently diurese
 keep CVP 5-9.
   .
   # Fever and [**Name (NI) 8344**] Pt now afebrile and Leukocytosis resolved.
   Sputum cultures 8/12 demonstrated MSSA and pan sensitive Klebsiella. UA
   suggested UTI but Ucx demonstrated no growth. PICC and A-line tips sent
   for culture and vanco empirically started. Antibiotics course for
   aspiration PNA completed, but pt may have developed new VAP given
   prolonged period on ventilator. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR
   which may be residual from prior infection or new VAP.
   -D/c cipro as Ucx negative
   -Continue vancomycin pending PICC and A-line cultures and speciation of
   sputum cultures
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Alkalosis:  Pt with metabolic alkalosis and with resolving
   respiratory alkalosis, although he does become tachypneic when PEEP
   decreased to 5, perhaps due to intermitting mucous plugging as above.
   Metabolic alkalosis most likely due to contraction alkalosis as we are
   actively diuresing him, and he is not vomiting, not receiving bicarb,
   and is receiving TFs so OG not to suction.
   -Give KCl as we will continue diuresis
   -Follow ABGs
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct slowly decreasing although nose now packed and
   hematuria resolving. Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area
   during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely secondary to trauma sustained
   during aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.  Hematuria improving
 attributed to trauma from prior foley administration. UA negative for
   red cell casts suggestive of kidney emboli. Clot has been slow to
   clear.
   -ENT saw L middle turbinate bleed - they packed it. If rebleeds, give 3
   sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If continues to bleed, call
   ENT.
   -Monitor Hct
   -f/u Anti thrombin III
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 75-114. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol although heart rate still increases to 120s-140s.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better rate
   control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation. Unable to
   assess right now as patient is sedated.  He did receive >400mg valium
   in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head was negative.
   - Attempt to turn off propofol and use fentanyl boluses
   - U-tox in [**3-13**] days to determine if benzos still in system.
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and has been on mechanical ventilation. He has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) for which he has received thrombolytic therapy (tPa) and is now on a heparin drip. The patient may also have developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction: The patient has RV dilation with severe global free wall hypokinesis due to right heart strain caused by PE. There is concern for potential cardiac tamponade, and the patient should be monitored for decreased blood pressure (MAP < 60) and referred to cardiology for an echocardiogram. If necessary, dobutamine or milrinone may be initiated.
3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient initially had a fever and leukocytosis. Sputum cultures demonstrated methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and pan-sensitive Klebsiella. Urine culture showed no growth, and the tip of the arterial line is pending culture. Vancomycin was started empirically, and ciprofloxacin was discontinued as the urine culture was negative."

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and more alert. Pt changed
   to CPAP/PS [**11-17**] yesterday and continued on this overnight. Found to
   have b/l PE on CTA, s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt
   completed vanc/zosyn abx course for aspiration PNA but may have new VAP
   (see below). Also pt is still volume overloaded on exam.
   - wean to PEEP 5- in past, pt has not been able to tolerate this and
   becomes tachypneic, most likely due to increased
   secretions/intermittent plugging. Barriers to weaning include muscle
   weakness from prolonged period on vent (may need spring/rest SBT trials
   prior to extubation), inability to clear secretions, fluid overload.
   - Consult IP regarding tracheostomy given prolonged ventilator course.
   Have discussed this with patient
   - heparin drip for PE
 PTT continues to be therapeutic
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP 5-9. Do not diurese too
   much as pt has limited RV function. Goal negative 500cc -1L today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   -If pt becomes tachypneic, suction secretions and increase PEEP instead
   of increasing sedation as pt does not appear to be agitated on vent.
   - attempt to keep propofol off and control pain with fentanyl; avoiding
   versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even though last valium dose
   was [**9-10**].
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis due to Right heart strain due to PE.
   -If BP decreases (MAP<60), call Cardiology for stat ECHO to evaluate
   for potential tamponade. Do not give fluids as this can cause RV to
   dilate further and impair what function is there.  Will need to start
   dobuatine or milronone.
   -Appreciate cardiology recs
 will follow up
   -Gently diurese
 keep CVP 5-9.
   .
   # Fever and [**Name (NI) 8344**] Pt now afebrile and Leukocytosis resolved.
   Sputum cultures 8/12 demonstrated MSSA and pan sensitive Klebsiella. UA
   suggested UTI but Ucx demonstrated no growth. PICC and A-line tips sent
   for culture and vanco empirically started. Antibiotics course for
   aspiration PNA completed, but pt may have developed new VAP given
   prolonged period on ventilator. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR
   which may be residual from prior infection or new VAP.
   -D/c cipro as Ucx negative
   -Continue vancomycin pending PICC and A-line cultures and speciation of
   sputum cultures
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Alkalosis:  Pt with metabolic alkalosis and with resolving
   respiratory alkalosis, although he does become tachypneic when PEEP
   decreased to 5, perhaps due to intermitting mucous plugging as above.
   Metabolic alkalosis most likely due to contraction alkalosis as we are
   actively diuresing him, and he is not vomiting, not receiving bicarb,
   and is receiving TFs so OG not to suction.
   -Give KCl as we will continue diuresis
   -Follow ABGs
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct slowly decreasing although nose now packed and
   hematuria resolving. Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area
   during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely secondary to trauma sustained
   during aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.  Hematuria improving
 attributed to trauma from prior foley administration. UA negative for
   red cell casts suggestive of kidney emboli. Clot has been slow to
   clear.
   -ENT saw L middle turbinate bleed - they packed it. If rebleeds, give 3
   sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If continues to bleed, call
   ENT.
   -Monitor Hct
   -f/u Anti thrombin III
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 75-114. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol although heart rate still increases to 120s-140s.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better rate
   control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation. Unable to
   assess right now as patient is sedated.  He did receive >400mg valium
   in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head was negative.
   - Attempt to turn off propofol and use fentanyl boluses
   - U-tox in [**3-13**] days to determine if benzos still in system.
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He is currently in the ICU due to various complications. 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and is intubated. His recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.51, indicating metabolic alkalosis. The patient also has an altered mental status, which is likely due to benzodiazepine overdose, as evidenced by the high dose of valium received in the ICU. 

The patient's cardiovascular system is compromised, with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and dilation. This is likely secondary to a pulmonary embolism (PE), as confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient has been treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) and is now on a heparin drip.

Furthermore, the patient has atrial fibrillation (AF), which has been present since admission. His chest X-ray reveals bibasilar opacification consistent with atelectasis and layering small pleural effusions, but no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, but the urine culture was negative. Sputum cultures demonstrated methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and pan-sensitive Klebsiella, but the urine culture did not grow any organisms. The patient has completed"

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and more alert. Pt changed
   to CPAP/PS yesterday and continued on this overnight. Found to have b/l
   PE on CTA, s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt completed
   vanc/zosyn abx course for aspiration PNA but may have new VAP (see
   below). Also pt is still volume overloaded on exam.
   - wean PEEP as tolerated with SBT
 barriers to weaning include
   muscle weakness from prolonged period on vent (may need spring/rest SBT
   trials prior to extubation), inability to clear secretions depending on
   mental status, fluid overload.
   - heparin drip for PE
 PTT continues to be therapeutic
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP 5-9. Do not diurese too
   much as pt has limited RV function. Goal -1L today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - close monitoring for respiratory status with goal O2 >93%.
   - try to wean propofol  to better assess pt
s mental status; avoid
   versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even though last valium dose
   was [**9-10**].
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis.
   -If BP decreases, call Cardiology for stat ECHO to evaluate for
   potential tamponade. Do not give fluids as this can cause RV to dilate
   further and impair what function is there.  Will need to start
   dobuatine or milronone.
   -Appreciate cardiology recs
 will follow up
   -Gently diurese
 keep CVP 5-9.
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Pt with continued fever although improving.
   Leukocytosis resolved. Sputum cultures 8/12 demonstrated MSSA and pan
   sensitive Klebsiella. UA suggested UTI but Ucx demonstrated no growth.
   PICC and A-line tips sent for culture and vanco empirically started.
   Antibiotics course for aspiration PNA completed, but pt may have
   developed new VAP given prolonged period on ventilator. Also on the
   differential is propofol infusion syndrome.
   -D/c cipro
   -Continue vancomycin pending PICC and A-line cultures
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct slowly decreasing and pt has hematuria and nose
   bleeds. Nose now packed. Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area
   during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely secondary to trauma sustained
   during aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.  Hematuria persists
   attributed to trauma from prior foley administration. UA negative for
   red cell casts suggestive of kidney emboli. Clot has been slow to
   clear.
   -ENT saw L middle turbinate bleed - they packed it. If rebleeds, give 3
   sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If continues to bleed, call
   ENT.
   -Monitor Hct
   -f/u Anti thrombin III
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 75-114. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol with good control. CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit
   from ASA for long-term thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute
   setting.
   - If A-flutter not controlled, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN (per cards)
   - continue diltiazem given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 tid
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation. Unable to
   assess right now as patient is sedated.  He did receive >400mg valium
   in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head was negative.
   - try to wean propofol to better assess pt
s mental status
   - U-tox in [**3-13**] days to determine if benzos still in system.
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
 change to PO as pt has OG tube
   - Social work following

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, right ventricular dysfunction, fever and leukocytosis, bleeding, and altered mental status.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and more alert. He was changed to CPAP/PSV yesterday and continued overnight. The patient has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA), which was treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). He is now on a heparin drip. The patient completed a course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia but may have developed new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Barriers to weaning from mechanical ventilation include muscle weakness, inability to clear secretions, fluid overload, and limited right ventricular function. The plan is to wean PEEP as tolerated with spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), monitor respiratory status with goal oxygen saturation >93%, provide frequent suctioning and pulmonary toilet, and titrate furosemide (Lasix) to goal central venous pressure (CVP) of 5-9. 

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is currently on"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including sedation,
   volume-overload, right heart failure, perhaps component of pulmonary
   embolism/atalectasis.   Remains PEEP sensitive, may be related to
   volume expansion.  Continuye to allow to wake up, continue diuresis
   (gently given prior RV dysfxn before lysis).  Trial of pressure
   support, hope to work towards extubation.  Consider tracheotomy tube if
   progress limited.
   THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE
 s/p lysis for severe clot burden, with some
   response.  Unclear as to whether there is component of chronicity to to
   pulmonary emboli.
   RV DYSFUNCTION
 Severe; attributed to pulmonary emboli, right outflow
   obstruction.  Severe dysfunction.  No echo evidence for recovery of RV
   function.  Uncertain as to nature of chronicity (ex. Chronic
   thromboembolic disease, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
   hypertension).
   ALETERED MENTAL STATUS --   Improved today, suspect slow clearance of
   benzodiazepines.  Monitor benzidiazepine periodically to monitor
   clearance.
   FEVER -- improved.  Completed iv antibiotics for pneumonia (MSSA and
   GNR) --> completed 8 days for presumed VAP.  Emirically started
   Ciprofloxicin
 plan to d/c as evidence for acitive pneumonia limited.
   Concern for line-related infection (a-line dc
 vanco.  Await line
   tip cultures.
   EPISTAXIS -- Appreciate ENT input.  Now w/ posterior nasal packing
   maintain.
   HEMATURIA -- likely Foley trauma in setting of heparin infusion.
   Improving.
   A-FIB -- possibly related to PE given present on admission (vs.
   alcohol).  Rate currently controlled.   Diltiazem standing dose and
   prn.
   ETOH AbUSE -- now beyond risk for acute withdrawal.  Social service.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including sedation,
   volume-overload, right heart failure, perhaps component of pulmonary
   embolism/atalectasis.   Remains PEEP sensitive, may be related to
   volume expansion.  Continuye to allow to wake up, continue diuresis
   (gently given prior RV dysfxn before lysis).  Trial of pressure
   support, hope to work towards extubation.  Consider tracheotomy tube if
   progress limited.
   THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE
 s/p lysis for severe clot burden, with some
   response.  Unclear as to whether there is component of chronicity to to
   pulmonary emboli.
   RV DYSFUNCTION
 Severe; attributed to pulmonary emboli, right outflow
   obstruction.  Severe dysfunction.  No echo evidence for recovery of RV
   function.  Uncertain as to nature of chronicity (ex. Chronic
   thromboembolic disease, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
   hypertension).
   ALETERED MENTAL STATUS --   Improved today, suspect slow clearance of
   benzodiazepines.  Monitor benzidiazepine periodically to monitor
   clearance.
   FEVER -- improved.  Completed iv antibiotics for pneumonia (MSSA and
   GNR) --> completed 8 days for presumed VAP.  Emirically started
   Ciprofloxicin
 plan to d/c as evidence for acitive pneumonia limited.
   Concern for line-related infection (a-line dc
 vanco.  Await line
   tip cultures.
   EPISTAXIS -- Appreciate ENT input.  Now w/ posterior nasal packing
   maintain.
   HEMATURIA -- likely Foley trauma in setting of heparin infusion.
   Improving.
   A-FIB -- possibly related to PE given present on admission (vs.
   alcohol).  Rate currently controlled.   Diltiazem standing dose and
   prn.
   ETOH AbUSE -- now beyond risk for acute withdrawal.  Social service.

- Physical examination reveals no acute distress, warm skin, and trace lower extremity edema.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), and other abnormalities.
- The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, thromboembolic disease, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, altered mental status, fever, epistaxis, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, and ethanol abuse.
- The patient's current care plan includes allowing gradual wake-up trials, continuing diuretics, trial of pressure support, and consideration for tracheotomy tube if progress is limited.
- The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes sedation, volume overload, right heart failure, and possibly pulmonary embolism/atalectasis. The patient remains PEEP sensitive and may be related to volume expansion. There is a plan to continue diuretics and allow wake-up trials, with the goal of working towards extubation.

2. Thromboembolic Disease: The patient had severe clot burden and underwent lysis with some response. It is unclear if there is a chronic component to the pulmonary emboli. The patient has RV dysfunction attributed to pulmonary emboli and right outflow obstruction. There is no echo evidence for recovery of"

 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   remains on heparin drip therapeutic PTT
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   PS [**11-17**] intermittently tachypneic in the mid 40's, started on
   vancomcyin [**9-25**] for gram negative rods ? VAP, diuresed with lasix,
   patient is 10L positive for LOS
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   patient intubated [**9-17**] - unresposive and no gag
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and more alert.  Became
   tachypneic to 40s on CPAP/PS of [**11-12**] yesterday despite aggressive
   suctioning, was increased to CPAP/PS of [**1-17**] and sedation increased.
   Respiratory failure due to bilateral PEs, patient is s/p tPa treatment,
   now on heparin drip.  He has completed vanc/zosyn abx course for
   aspiration PNA but may have new VAP (see below). Also pt is still
   volume overloaded on exam.
   - get patient out of bed to chair
   - wean down PEEP as tolerated.  Patient was able to tolerate PEEP of 5
   for most of yesterday, but became tachypneic overnight despite
   suctioning.  Likely due to increased secretions/intermittent plugging
   and muscle weakness.
   - IP consulted, scheduled for tracheostomy on [**Last Name (LF) 1786**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] likely have
   to be performed in OR
   - continue heparin drip for PE, patient has been therapeutic
   - continue to monitor PTT
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Do not
   overdiurese as pt has limited RV function. Goal negative 500cc -1L
   today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - will attempt to suction and increase PEEP before increasing
   sedation.  Try and wean off sedation as much as possible.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis due to Right heart strain due to PE.
   -If BP decreases (MAP<60), call Cardiology for stat ECHO to evaluate
   for potential tamponade. Do not give fluids as this can cause RV to
   dilate further and impair what function is there.  Will need to start
   dobuatine or milronone.
   -Appreciate cardiology recs
 will follow up
   -Gently diurese
 keep CVP 5-9.
   .
   # Fever and [**Name (NI) 8344**] Pt now afebrile and Leukocytosis resolved.
   Sputum cultures 8/12 demonstrated MSSA and pan sensitive Klebsiella. UA
   suggested UTI but Ucx demonstrated no growth. PICC and A-line tips sent
   for culture and vanco empirically started. Antibiotics course for
   aspiration PNA completed, but pt may have developed new VAP given
   prolonged period on ventilator. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR
   which may be residual from prior infection or new VAP.
   -D/c cipro as Ucx negative
   -Continue vancomycin pending PICC and A-line cultures and speciation of
   sputum cultures
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Alkalosis:  Pt with metabolic alkalosis and with resolving
   respiratory alkalosis, although he does become tachypneic when PEEP
   decreased to 5, perhaps due to intermitting mucous plugging as above.
   Metabolic alkalosis most likely due to contraction alkalosis as we are
   actively diuresing him, and he is not vomiting, not receiving bicarb,
   and is receiving TFs so OG not to suction.
   -Give KCl as we will continue diuresis
   -Follow ABGs
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct slowly decreasing although nose now packed and
   hematuria resolving. Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area
   during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely secondary to trauma sustained
   during aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.  Hematuria improving
 attributed to trauma from prior foley administration. UA negative for
   red cell casts suggestive of kidney emboli. Clot has been slow to
   clear.
   -ENT saw L middle turbinate bleed - they packed it. If rebleeds, give 3
   sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If continues to bleed, call
   ENT.
   -Monitor Hct
   -f/u Anti thrombin III
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 75-114. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol although heart rate still increases to 120s-140s.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better rate
   control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation.  He did receive
   >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head
   was negative.
   - Attempt to turn off propofol and use fentanyl boluses
   - U-tox in [**3-13**] days to determine if benzos still in system.
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, inability to protect the airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), pulmonary embolism (PE), right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, fever, metabolic alkalosis, bleeding, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and more alert. He became tachypneic to 40s on CPAP/PS of 11-12 yesterday despite aggressive suctioning. The respiratory failure is due to bilateral PEs, and the patient has been treated with tPA. He is now on a heparin drip. The patient may have new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and there are concerns about increased secretions and intermittent plugging.

2. Inability to Protect the Airway: The patient is intubated and unresponsive with no gag reflex. This puts him at risk for aspiration, altered airway clearance, and cough. 

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has had bilateral PEs, and the right ventricular strain is causing RV dysfunction. He is on a heparin drip for treatment and monitoring of PTT levels.

4. Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction:"

   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and more alert. Pt changed
   to CPAP/PS [**11-17**] yesterday and continued on this overnight. Found to
   have b/l PE on CTA, s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.  Pt
   completed vanc/zosyn abx course for aspiration PNA but may have new VAP
   (see below). Also pt is still volume overloaded on exam.
   - wean to PEEP 5- in past, pt has not been able to tolerate this and
   becomes tachypneic, most likely due to increased
   secretions/intermittent plugging. Barriers to weaning include muscle
   weakness from prolonged period on vent (may need spring/rest SBT trials
   prior to extubation), inability to clear secretions, fluid overload.
   - Consult IP regarding tracheostomy given prolonged ventilator course.
   Have discussed this with patient
   - heparin drip for PE
 PTT continues to be therapeutic
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP 5-9. Do not diurese too
   much as pt has limited RV function. Goal negative 500cc -1L today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   -If pt becomes tachypneic, suction secretions and increase PEEP instead
   of increasing sedation as pt does not appear to be agitated on vent.
   - attempt to keep propofol off and control pain with fentanyl; avoiding
   versed as pt may still have benzo overdose even though last valium dose
   was [**9-10**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient is currently intubated and more alert, changing to CPAP/PSV yesterday and continuing overnight. He was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA), treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa), and now on a heparin drip. 

The patient completed a course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia but may have developed new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is still volume overloaded on examination. 

Barriers to weaning from mechanical ventilation include muscle weakness from prolonged ventilation, inability to clear secretions, and fluid overload. A tracheostomy has been consulted due to the prolonged ventilator course. 

The patient is on a heparin drip for PE, with PTT continuing to be therapeutic. He is being diuresed with Lasix to achieve a goal negative fluid balance of 500cc-1L today. 

The patient has respiratory failure due to inability to protect his airway, which may lead to aspiration and altered gag reflex. 

He also has right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with severe global free wall hypokinesis due to right heart strain caused by PE"

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   remains on heparin drip therapeutic PTT
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   PS [**11-17**] intermittently tachypneic in the mid 40's, started on
   vancomcyin [**9-25**] for gram negative rods ? VAP, diuresed with lasix,
   patient is 10L positive for LOS
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   patient intubated [**9-17**] - unresposive and no gag
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and more alert.  Became
   tachypneic to 40s on CPAP/PS of [**11-12**] yesterday despite aggressive
   suctioning, was increased to CPAP/PS of [**1-17**] and sedation increased.
   Will give pt some diaphragmatic rest today on AC and attempt CPAP/PS
   again in short trials to strengthen diaphragm.  Respiratory failure
   likely due to bilateral PEs, patient is s/p tPa treatment, now on
   heparin drip.  He has completed vanc/zosyn abx course for aspiration
   PNA but may have new VAP (see below). Also pt is still +11 L
   overloaded on this admission.
   - get patient out of bed to chair
   - wean down PEEP as tolerated.  Patient was able to tolerate PEEP of 5
   for most of yesterday, but became tachypneic overnight despite
   suctioning.  Likely due to increased secretions/intermittent plugging
   and muscle weakness.
   - IP consulted, scheduled for tracheostomy on [**Last Name (LF) 1786**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] likely have
   to be performed in OR
   - continue heparin drip for PE
   - continue to monitor PTT
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Do not
   overdiurese as pt has limited RV function. Goal negative 500cc -1L
   today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - will attempt to suction and increase PEEP before increasing sedation.
    Try and wean off sedation as much as possible.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - hold tube feeds and heparin drip at midnight for planned trach
   tomorrow
   - contact IP about PEG placement along with trach
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis due to Right heart strain due to PE.
   -If BP decreases (MAP<60), call Cardiology for stat ECHO to evaluate
   for potential tamponade. Do not give fluids as this can cause RV to
   dilate further and impair what function is there.  Will need to start
   dobuatine or milronone.
   -Appreciate cardiology recs
 will follow up
   -Gently diurese
 keep CVP 5-9.
   - consider IVC filter placement to prevent further PEs, RV cannot incur
   any further insults
   .
   # Fever and [**Name (NI) 8344**] Pt now afebrile and Leukocytosis resolved.
   Sputum cultures 8/12 demonstrated MSSA and pan sensitive Klebsiella. UA
   suggested UTI but Ucx demonstrated no growth. PICC and A-line tips sent
   for culture and vanco empirically started. Antibiotics course for
   aspiration PNA completed, but pt may have developed new VAP given
   prolonged period on ventilator. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR
   which may be residual from prior infection or new VAP.
   -D/c cipro as Ucx negative
   -Continue vancomycin pending PICC and A-line cultures and speciation of
   sputum cultures
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Alkalosis:  Pt with metabolic alkalosis and with resolving
   respiratory alkalosis, although he does become tachypneic when PEEP
   decreased to 5, perhaps due to intermitting mucous plugging as above.
   Metabolic alkalosis most likely due to contraction alkalosis as we are
   actively diuresing him, and he is not vomiting, not receiving bicarb,
   and is receiving TFs so OG not to suction.
   -Give KCl as we will continue diuresis
   -Follow ABGs
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct slowly decreasing although nose now packed and
   hematuria resolving. Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area
   during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely secondary to trauma sustained
   during aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.  Hematuria improving
 attributed to trauma from prior foley administration. UA negative for
   red cell casts suggestive of kidney emboli. Clot has been slow to
   clear.  Antithrombin is normal
   - reconsult ENT about nasal packing.
   - If rebleeds, give 3 sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If
   continues to bleed, call ENT.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 75-114. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol although heart rate still increases to 120s-140s.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better rate
   control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation.  He did receive
   >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head
   was negative.
   - Attempt to turn off propofol and use fentanyl boluses
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including sedation,
   volume-overload, right heart failure, perhaps component of pulmonary
   embolism/atalectasis, and generalized weakness.   Remains PEEP
   sensitive, may be related to volume expansion.  Continue to allow to
   wake up, continue diuresis (gently given prior RV dysfxn before
   lysis).  Very limited progress with SBT.  Plan to move to tracheotomy
   tube (scheduled for tomorrow).
   THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE
 s/p lysis for severe clot burden, with some
   response.  Unclear as to whether there is component of chronicity to to
   pulmonary emboli.  Will need follow-up to assess for development of
   chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.  Would recommend
   placement IVC filter.
   RV DYSFUNCTION
 Severe; attributed to pulmonary emboli, right outflow
   obstruction.  Severe dysfunction.  No echo evidence for recovery of RV
   function since thrombectomy.  Uncertain as to nature of chronicity (ex.
   Chronic thromboembolic disease, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
   hypertension).
   WEAKNESS, GENERALIZED -- deconditioning, ICU polyneuropathy.  No
   steroid or paralytic use in early portion of hospitalization.  Splints,
   consider specialized mattress.  Would proceed with PT consult.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS --   Improved today, suspect slow clearance of
   benzodiazepines.  Monitor benzidiazepine periodically to monitor
   clearance.  Hope to d/c propofol once tracheostomy tube placed.
   FEVER -- improved.  Completed iv antibiotics for pneumonia (MSSA and
   GNR) --> completed 8 days for presumed VAP.  Emirically started
   Ciprofloxicin
 plan to d/c as evidence for acitive pneumonia limited.
   Concern for line-related infection (a-line dc
 vanco.  Await line
   tip cultures.
   EPISTAXIS -- Appreciate ENT input.  Now w/ posterior nasal packing
   maintain.  Hope to discontinue nasal packing soon.
   HEMATURIA -- likely Foley trauma in setting of heparin infusion.
   Improving.
   A-FIB -- possibly related to PE given present on admission (vs.
   alcohol).  Rate currently controlled.   Diltiazem standing dose and
   prn.
   ETOH ABUSE -- now beyond risk for acute withdrawal.  Social service
   consult.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a history of atrial fibrillation. His blood work shows elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactic acid. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including thromboembolic disease, right ventricular dysfunction, generalized weakness, altered mental status, fever, epistaxis, hematuria, and alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thromboembolic Disease: The patient has had severe clot burden and response to lysis, indicating the presence of thromboembolic disease. This may have resulted in pulmonary emboli, which can lead to further complications such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.
2. Right Ventricular Dysfunction: The patient's right ventricular dysfunction is severe and attributed to pulmonary emboli causing right outflow obstruction. This can result in reduced cardiac output and organ perfusion.
3. Generalized Weakness: The patient is experiencing generalized weakness, which can be attributed to deconditioning and ICU polyneuropathy. This can impact his ability to wean off mechanical ventilation and increase the risk of complications.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has improved mental status today, but previously had altered mental status that was suspected to be related to slow clearance of benzodiazepines. Monitoring benzodiazep"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, thromboembolic disease, right ventricular dysfunction, generalized weakness, altered mental status, fever, epistaxis, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, ethanol abuse, and requires nutritional support. The patient's condition is multifactorial, including sedation, volume overload, right heart failure, and possibly a component of pulmonary embolism/atalectasis. The patient is PEEP sensitive and may be related to volume expansion. The patient's respiratory failure persists, and there has been limited progress with spontaneous breathing trials. The plan is to move to a tracheotomy tube. The patient underwent lysis for severe clot burden with some response, but it is unclear whether there is a chronic component to the pulmonary emboli. The patient will need follow-up to assess for the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and placement of an inferior vena cava filter is recommended. The patient has severe right ventricular dysfunction attributed to pulmonary emboli, right outflow obstruction, and no echo evidence for recovery of RV function since thrombectomy. The patient's generalized weakness is attributed to deconditioning and ICU polyneuropathy. There are no steroids or paralytic use in the early portion of hospitalization, and splints and specialized mattress are being considered. A physical therapy consult has been planned. The patient's altered mental status is improving and is suspected to be due to slow clearance of benzod"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including sedation,
   volume-overload, right heart failure, perhaps component of pulmonary
   embolism/atalectasis, and generalized weakness.   Remains PEEP
   sensitive, may be related to volume expansion.  Continue to allow to
   wake up, continue diuresis (gently given prior RV dysfxn before
   lysis).  Very limited progress with SBT.  Plan to move to tracheotomy
   tube (scheduled for tomorrow).
   THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE
 s/p lysis for severe clot burden, with some
   response.  Unclear as to whether there is component of chronicity to to
   pulmonary emboli.  Will need follow-up to assess for development of
   chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.  Would recommend
   placement IVC filter.
   RV DYSFUNCTION
 Severe; attributed to pulmonary emboli, right outflow
   obstruction.  Severe dysfunction.  No echo evidence for recovery of RV
   function since thrombectomy.  Uncertain as to nature of chronicity (ex.
   Chronic thromboembolic disease, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
   hypertension).
   WEAKNESS, GENERALIZED -- deconditioning, ICU polyneuropathy.  No
   steroid or paralytic use in early portion of hospitalization.  Splints,
   consider specialized mattress.  Would proceed with PT consult.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS --   Improved today, suspect slow clearance of
   benzodiazepines.  Monitor benzidiazepine periodically to monitor
   clearance.  Hope to d/c propofol once tracheostomy tube placed.
   FEVER -- improved.  Completed iv antibiotics for pneumonia (MSSA and

   patient is 10L positive for LOS
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,

   patient intubated [**9-17**] - unresposive and no gag
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and more alert.  Became
   tachypneic to 40s on CPAP/PS of [**11-12**] yesterday despite aggressive
   suctioning, was increased to CPAP/PS of [**1-17**] and sedation increased.
   Will give pt some diaphragmatic rest today on AC and attempt CPAP/PS
   again in short trials to strengthen diaphragm.  Respiratory failure
   likely due to bilateral PEs, patient is s/p tPa treatment, now on
   heparin drip.  He has completed vanc/zosyn abx course for aspiration
   PNA but may have new VAP (see below). Also pt is still +11 L
   overloaded on this admission.
   - get patient out of bed to chair
   - wean down PEEP as tolerated.  Patient was able to tolerate PEEP of 5
   for most of yesterday, but became tachypneic overnight despite
   suctioning.  Likely due to increased secretions/intermittent plugging
   and muscle weakness.
   - IP consulted, scheduled for tracheostomy on [**Last Name (LF) 1786**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] likely have
   to be performed in OR
   - continue heparin drip for PE
   - continue to monitor PTT
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Do not
   overdiurese as pt has limited RV function. Goal negative 500cc -1L
   today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - will attempt to suction and increase PEEP before increasing
   sedation.  Try and wean off sedation as much as possible.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - hold tube feeds and heparin drip at midnight for planned trach
   tomorrow
   - contact IP about PEG placement along with trach
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis due to Right heart strain due to PE.
   -If BP decreases (MAP<60), call Cardiology for stat ECHO to evaluate
   for potential tamponade. Do not give fluids as this can cause RV to
   dilate further and impair what function is there.  Will need to start
   dobuatine or milronone.
   -Appreciate cardiology recs
 will follow up
   -Gently diurese
 keep CVP 5-9.
   - consider IVC filter placement to prevent further PEs, RV cannot incur
   any further insults
   .
   # Fever and [**Name (NI) 8344**] Pt now afebrile and Leukocytosis resolved.
   Sputum cultures 8/12 demonstrated MSSA and pan sensitive Klebsiella. UA
   suggested UTI but Ucx demonstrated no growth. PICC and A-line tips sent
   for culture and vanco empirically started. Antibiotics course for
   aspiration PNA completed, but pt may have developed new VAP given
   prolonged period on ventilator. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR
   which may be residual from prior infection or new VAP.
   -D/c cipro as Ucx negative
   -Continue vancomycin pending PICC and A-line cultures and speciation of
   sputum cultures
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Alkalosis:  Pt with metabolic alkalosis and with resolving
   respiratory alkalosis, although he does become tachypneic when PEEP
   decreased to 5, perhaps due to intermitting mucous plugging as above.
   Metabolic alkalosis most likely due to contraction alkalosis as we are
   actively diuresing him, and he is not vomiting, not receiving bicarb,
   and is receiving TFs so OG not to suction.
   -Give KCl as we will continue diuresis
   -Follow ABGs
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct slowly decreasing although nose now packed and
   hematuria resolving. Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area
   during tPa treatment.  Bleeding likely secondary to trauma sustained
   during aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.  Hematuria improving
 attributed to trauma from prior foley administration. UA negative for
   red cell casts suggestive of kidney emboli. Clot has been slow to
   clear.  Antithrombin is normal
   - reconsult ENT about nasal packing.
   - If rebleeds, give 3 sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If
   continues to bleed, call ENT.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 75-114. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol although heart rate still increases to 120s-140s.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better rate
   control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation.  He did receive
   >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head
   was negative.
   - Attempt to turn off propofol and use fentanyl boluses
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Social work following
   .
   # Weakness
 patient has had prolonged stay in hospital
   - PT consult

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and has been experiencing tachypnea in the mid-40s. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged ventilation.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has had multiple PEs, for which they have received treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and are now on a heparin drip.

3. Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction: The patient's right ventricle is affected due to severe global free wall hypokinesis as a result of the PE. There is a risk of further RV insult, and consideration should be given to placing an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.

4. Fever and Infection: The patient has had fever and leukocytosis, which may be due to an infection. Previous sputum cultures showed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and pan-sensitive Klebsiella. New sputum cultures show growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR), which could indicate a new VAP.

5. Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction alkalosis from aggressive diuresis.

6. Bleeding: The patient experienced bleeding from the anterior pharyngeal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), fever and leukocytosis, metabolic alkalosis, bleeding, atrial fibrillation, change in mental status, and weakness.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and alert. He became tachypneic to 40s on CPAP/PS on 11-22-2021 despite aggressive suctioning, and was placed back on assisted control ventilation (AC) for diaphragmatic rest. He is currently on AC with a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.4. The respiratory failure is likely due to bilateral Pes. The patient has received thrombolytic therapy (tPa) for PE and is now on a heparin drip. The patient may have developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as indicated by new sputum culture results showing Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient's fluid balance is still positive 10 liters over the course of admission.

   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   patient intubated [**9-17**] - unresposive and no gag
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated and alert.  Became
   tachypneic to 40s on CPAP/PS of [**11-22**] yesterday despite aggressive
   suctioning, was placed back on AC for diaphragmatic rest.  Currently on
   AC: Vt 550, RR 14, PEEP 12, FiO2 0.4.  Respiratory failure likely due
   to bilateral Pes.  Patient is s/p tPa treatment, now on heparin drip.
   Pt may have new VAP (see below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is still +10
   L  over course of admission.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - wean down PEEP as tolerated.  Tracheostomy requires PEEP of < 8
   - Trach and PEG scheduled for today
   - continue heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Do not
   overdiurese as pt has limited RV function. Goal negative 500cc -1L
   today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets
   - will attempt to suction and increase PEEP before increasing
   sedation.  Try and wean off sedation as much as possible.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis due to Right heart strain due to PE.
   - Cardiology signing off - if hypotensive, stop diuresis, do ECHO; if
   Echo negative, THEN start ionotropic [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Gently diurese
 keep CVP 5-9.
   - IVC filter today to prevent any further PEs until RV improved
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Febrile overnight to 102.2.  Pan-cultured.
   Antibiotics course for aspiration PNA completed, but pt may have
   developed new VAP given prolonged period on ventilator, currently on
   vancomycin. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR which may be
   residual from prior infection or new VAP.
   -D/c cipro as Ucx negative
   -Continue vancomycin pending PICC and A-line cultures and speciation of
   sputum cultures
   -f/u cultures
   -tylenol for fever
   .
   # Alkalosis:  Pt with metabolic alkalosis and with resolving
   respiratory alkalosis.  Metabolic alkalosis most likely due to
   contraction alkalosis as we are actively diuresing him, and he is not
   vomiting, not receiving bicarb, and is receiving TFs so OG not to
   suction.
   -Give KCl as we will continue diuresis
   -Follow ABGs
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct slowly decreasing although nose now packed and
   hematuria resolving. Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area
   during tPa treatment, packed with absorbable packing by ENT.  Bleeding
   likely secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior
   to intubation.  Hematuria improving
 attributed to trauma from prior
   foley administration. UA negative for red cell casts suggestive of
   kidney emboli. Clot has been slow to clear.  Antithrombin is normal.
   - If rebleeds, give 3 sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If
   continues to bleed, call ENT.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 75-114. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol although heart rate still increases to 120s-140s.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better rate
   control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation.  He did receive
   >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head
   was negative.
   - Attempt to turn off propofol and use fentanyl boluses
   -Triglycerides sent as hypertriglyceridemia with subsequent
   pancreatitis is a side effect of propofol.
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Social work following
   .
   # Weakness
 patient has had prolonged stay in hospital
   - PT recommendations
 out of bed to chair > 1 hr a day
   - OT consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently intubated and alert, with ongoing respiratory failure due to bilateral Pes. He is being treated for pulmonary embolism (PE) with heparin drip and has received tissue plasminogen activator (tPa). The patient's fluid balance is still positive by 10 liters over the course of admission. 

The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix) at 2 mg/hour, propofol at 10 mcg/kg/min, and vancomycin. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL and elevated lactate acid levels at 1.6 mmol/L. His renal function is compromised with an elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL and a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 29.1 mL/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles in the lungs, warm and well-perfused extremities with 2+ pulses, and no leg edema. Neurological examination shows normal motor function with the ability to follow commands, squeeze fingers, plantar"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Multifactorial, including sedation,
   volume-overload, right heart failure, perhaps component of pulmonary
   embolism/atalectasis, and generalized weakness.   Remains PEEP
   sensitive, may be related to volume expansion.  Continue to allow to
   wake up, continue diuresis (gently given prior RV dysfxn before
   lysis).  Very limited progress with SBT.  Plan to move to tracheotomy
   tube (scheduled for today).
   THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE
 s/p lysis for severe clot burden, with some
   response.  Unclear as to whether there is component of chronicity to to
   pulmonary emboli.  Will need follow-up to assess for development of
   chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.  Would recommend
   placement IVC filter to protect from recurrent emoblism.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- with recurrent hypotension and more distant
   heart sounds, would repeat ECHO to assess for increased pericardial
   effusion and evideince for tamponade.
   RV DYSFUNCTION
 Severe; attributed to pulmonary emboli, right outflow
   obstruction.  Severe dysfunction.  No echo evidence for recovery of RV
   function since thrombectomy.  Uncertain as to nature of chronicity (ex.
   Chronic thromboembolic disease, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
   hypertension).
   WEAKNESS, GENERALIZED -- deconditioning, ICU polyneuropathy.  No
   steroid or paralytic use in early portion of hospitalization.  Splints,
   consider specialized mattress.  Would proceed with PT consult.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS --   Improved today, suspect slow clearance of
   benzodiazepines.  Monitor benzidiazepine periodically to monitor
   clearance.  Hope to d/c propofol once tracheostomy tube placed.
   FEVER -- Recurrent.  Concerns include evolving tracheobronchitis or
   pneumonia (VAP), line-related infection (+a-line culture), or sinusitis
   (nasal packing in place).  Check sputum culture, blood culture
   results.  Send stool for C. diff.  Plan emirical Ceftriaxone and
   Vanco.
   EPISTAXIS -- Appreciate ENT input.  Now w/ posterior nasal packing
   maintain.  Hope to discontinue nasal packing soon.
   HEMATURIA -- likely Foley trauma in setting of heparin infusion.
   Improving.
   A-FIB -- possibly related to PE given present on admission (vs.
   alcohol).  Rate currently controlled.   Diltiazem standing dose and
   prn.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. The note mentions several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Thromboembolic disease: The patient had undergone lysis for severe clot burden, indicating a history of thromboembolic events. There is a concern for recurrent embolism, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be recommended.

2. Pericardial effusion: The patient's recurrent hypotension and distant heart sounds suggest the possibility of pericardial effusion, which could potentially lead to cardiac tamponade. An echocardiogram is planned to assess for increased pericardial effusion.

3. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction: Severe RV dysfunction has been attributed to pulmonary emboli and right outflow obstruction. The patient's recovery of RV function is uncertain.

4. Generalized weakness: The patient is experiencing generalized weakness, which may be due to deconditioning, ICU polyneuropathy, or other factors. Physical therapy consultation is planned.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved, but benzodiazepine use may be contributing to the altered mental state. Monitoring benzodiazepine clearance and discontinuing propofol once a tracheostomy tube is placed is advised.

6. Fever: The patient has recurrent fevers, which could be due to evolving tracheobronchitis"

   Echo ([**9-28**]) - The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
   borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-24**], the right ventricle is no longer dilated, and contractile
   function is markedly improved. The pericardial effusion is smaller.

   tracheostomy [**9-27**]
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: s/p tracheostomy on [**9-27**].  Pt is alert and
   cooperative.  Became tachypneic to 40s on CPAP/PS of [**11-22**] yesterday
   despite aggressive suctioning, was placed back on AC for diaphragmatic
   rest.  Currently on AC: Vt 550, RR 14, PEEP 12, FiO2 0.4.  Respiratory
   failure likely due to bilateral Pes.  Patient is s/p tPa treatment,
   maintained on heparin drip which was held for tracheostomy yesterday.
   Pt may have new VAP (see below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is still +9
   L  over course of admission.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PEG tube placement to be scheduled once fevers and cultures resolve
   - restart heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Goal negative
   500cc -1L today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 Pt noted to have RV dilation with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis due to Right heart strain due to PE on initial echo.
   Repeat echo shows right ventricle is no longer dilated and contractile
   function is markedly improved.  Heart sounds sound distant but echo
   shows that pericardial effusion is also improved.
   - Cardiology signing off - if hypotensive, stop diuresis, do ECHO; if
   Echo negative, THEN start ionotropic [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Gently diurese
 keep CVP 5-9.
   - consider IVC filter placement, patient
s right RV function has
   recovered
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Afebrile overnight.  Was pan-cultured
   yesterday.  Antibiotics course for aspiration PNA completed, but pt may
   have developed new VAP given prolonged period on ventilator, currently
   on vancomycin. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR which may be
   residual from prior infection or new VAP.  Consider possibility of
   sinusitis because of gauze packing in nostril.
   - broaden coverage with ceftriaxone for positive sputum culture and
   spiking fever despite on vancomycin
   - Continue vancomycin pending PICC and A-line cultures and speciation
   of sputum cultures
   - f/u cultures
   - tylenol for fever
   .
   # Alkalosis:  Pt with metabolic alkalosis and with resolving
   respiratory alkalosis.  Metabolic alkalosis most likely due to
   contraction alkalosis as we are actively diuresing him, and he is not
   vomiting, not receiving bicarb, and is receiving TFs so OG not to
   suction.
   -Give KCl as we will continue diuresis
   -Follow ABGs
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable at 29.0 today.  Nose still packed, no signs of
   further bleeding.  Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during
   tPa treatment, packed with absorbable packing by ENT.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation.  Hematuria resolving, attributed to trauma from prior foley
   administration. UA negative for red cell casts suggestive of kidney
   emboli. Clot has been slow to clear.  Antithrombin is normal.
   - concerns for possible sinusitis given fever.  Packing appears to be
   gauze, but ENT assures us that it
s absorbable.
   - If rebleeds, give 3 sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If
   continues to bleed, call ENT.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 75-114. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol although heart rate still increases to 120s-140s.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better rate
   control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation.  He did receive
   >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head
   was negative.
   - Consider discontinuing propofol for fentanyl as pt will need pain
   control s/p trach/PEG
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Social work following
   .
   # Weakness
 patient has had prolonged stay in hospital
   - PT recommendations
 out of bed to chair > 1 hr a day
   - OT consult

- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, with recent worsening despite aggressive suctioning. He was placed back on assist-control ventilation for diaphragmatic rest.
- The patient underwent a tracheostomy on [**9-27**] and is now alert and cooperative.
- The patient's right ventricle was previously dilated, but the recent echo shows it is no longer dilated, and contractile function is markedly improved. The pericardial effusion is smaller.
- The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, with new sputum cultures demonstrating gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to contraction alkalosis from aggressive diuresis.
- The patient had bleeding from the anterior pharyngeal area during tPA treatment and was packed by ENT. The bleeding was likely secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being treated with diltiazem and metoprolol.
- The patient's mental status has improved off sedation.
- The patient is in alcohol detoxification and has completed the withdrawal window.

   Echo ([**9-28**]) - The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
   borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-24**], the right ventricle is no longer dilated, and contractile
   function is markedly improved. The pericardial effusion is smaller.

   #. Respiratory Failure: s/p tracheostomy on [**9-27**].  Pt is alert and
   cooperative.  Became tachypneic to 40s on CPAP/PS of [**11-22**] yesterday
   despite aggressive suctioning, was placed back on AC for diaphragmatic
   rest.  Currently on AC: Vt 550, RR 14, PEEP 12, FiO2 0.4.  Respiratory
   failure likely due to bilateral Pes.  Patient is s/p tPa treatment,
   maintained on heparin drip which was held for tracheostomy yesterday.
   Pt may have new VAP (see below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is still +9
   L  over course of admission.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PEG tube placement to be scheduled once fevers and cultures resolve
   - restart heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Goal negative
   500cc -1L today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - decrease pressure support and FiO2 as tolerated
   - diaphragmatic rest overnight on AC
   .
   # RV dysfunction
Repeat echo shows right ventricle is no longer
   dilated and contractile function is markedly improved.  Heart sounds
   sound distant but echo shows that pericardial effusion is also
   improved.
   - Cardiology signing off - if hypotensive, stop diuresis, do ECHO; if
   Echo negative, THEN start ionotropic [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Gently diurese
 keep CVP 5-9.
   - will still pursue IVC filter placement as RV has just started to
   recover.
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Afebrile overnight.  Was pan-cultured
   yesterday.  Antibiotics course for aspiration PNA completed, but pt may
   have developed new VAP given prolonged period on ventilator, currently
   on vancomycin. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR which may be
   residual from prior infection or new VAP.  Consider possibility of
   sinusitis because of gauze packing in nostril.
   - Continue ceftriaxone (day [**3-17**]) for positive sputum culture and
   spiking fever despite being on vancomycin
   - Continue vancomycin (day [**5-15**]) for staph in A-line cultures and MRSA
   in sputum
   - f/u cultures
   - tylenol for fever
   .
   # Alkalosis:  Pt with metabolic alkalosis and with resolving
   respiratory alkalosis.  Metabolic alkalosis most likely due to
   contraction alkalosis as we are actively diuresing him, and he is not
   vomiting, not receiving bicarb, and is receiving TFs so OG not to
   suction.
   -Give KCl as we will continue diuresis
   -Follow ABGs
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable at 29.0 today.  Nose still packed, no signs of
   further bleeding.  Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during
   tPa treatment, packed with absorbable packing by ENT.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation.  Hematuria resolving, attributed to trauma from prior foley
   administration. UA negative for red cell casts suggestive of kidney
   emboli. Clot has been slow to clear.  Antithrombin is normal.
   - concerns for possible sinusitis given fever.  Packing appears to be
   gauze, but ENT assures us that it
s absorbable.
   - If rebleeds, give 3 sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If
   continues to bleed, call ENT.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 75-114. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol although heart rate still increases to 120s-140s.
   CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for long-term
   thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better rate
   control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation.  He did receive
   >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head
   was negative.
   -          wean patient off propofol as tolerated
   -          avoid benzos
   -          start low dose seroquel
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Social work following

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments including tracheostomy, percutaneous tracheostomy, trans-thoracic echo, EKG, and antibiotic therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory Failure: The patient is on assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to bilateral Pes (positive end-expiratory pressure). He has been treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) for pulmonary embolism and is maintained on a heparin drip.
- Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient had a fever and leukocytosis, indicating an infection. He was pan-cultured yesterday and started on vancomycin for gram-negative rods. New sputum cultures demonstrate gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, which may be residual from a prior infection or new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to contraction alkalosis from aggressive diuresis. He is also experiencing respiratory alkalosis.
- Bleeding: The patient had bleeding from the anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment and had a Foley catheter-related hematuria. Both are attributed to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to intubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with right ventricular overload. The patient has been intubated and is currently alert. He experienced respiratory failure due to bilateral pulmonary edema, and was treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) for a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a history of RV dysfunction, fever, leukocytosis, metabolic alkalosis, and bleeding. He also has atrial fibrillation and a change in mental status. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, as well as an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to prevent further PEs. The patient's sputum cultures show gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, as well as gram-negative rods. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, furosemide, propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still dependent on mechanical ventilation. The patient's fluid balance is still positive, indicating ongoing fluid overload. The patient's respiratory status is improving with the use of non-invasive ventilation. The patient's bleeding has resolved, but he continues to have some hematuria. The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male admitted for ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine toxicity, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and large bilateral pulmonary embolisms with marked right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and has been on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress
- Eyes/Conjunctiva: PERRL
- Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, OG tube, tracheostomy
- Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, peripheral pulses present
- Respiratory/Chest: Symmetrical expansion, resonant percussion, clear breath sounds with bibasilar crackles
- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
- Extremities: No lower extremity edema
- Musculoskeletal: Mild proximal muscle weakness
- Skin: Warm
- Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, normal tone

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/71 mmHg to 135/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus bradycardia.

Laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 437 K/uL
- Sodium: 110 mg/dL
- Potassium: 0.5 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
- Glucose: 108 mg/dL

Imaging shows improvement in right ventricular function with minimal effusion.

The patient's medical complications include:
- Pulmonary embolism (PE)
- Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS)
- Possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Bacteremia
- Generalized weakness (ICU polyneuropathy)

The plan includes continuing therapeutic heparin drip, weaning off propofol, switching to fentanyl, and adding low-dose seroquel to avoid benzodiazepines for agitation. Diuresis is continued with an I/O goal of -1L today. The patient is also being treated for MRSA and coag-negative staph bacteremia with appropriate antibiotics.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition remains in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted for ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine toxicity, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and large bilateral pulmonary embolisms with marked right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, respiratory rate within the desired range, and oxygen saturation above 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and his weight has decreased from admission. His central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal limits.

The patient has received various medications including furosemide, heparin, propofol, midazolam, pantoprazole, fentanyl, and others. He has also received nutritional support through tube feeds.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. His kidney function is within normal limits, but his liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Imaging shows improvement in right ventricular function and minimal effusion.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient remains on a heparin drip to prevent further pulmonary embolisms, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been planned once the patient becomes afebrile. The patient's respiratory failure continues to be managed with mechanical ventilation, with plans to wean the positive end-expiratory pressure ("

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR,
   bilateral PEs, RV  dysfunction which has improved s/p trach for
   prolonged respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: s/p tracheostomy on [**9-27**].  Pt is alert and
   cooperative.  Was on PSV at 8/5 and was placed back on AC for
   diaphragmatic rest (Vt 550, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 0.4) overnight. Back on
   PSV 5/5 this morning. Respiratory failure likely due to bilateral Pes
   and fluid overload.  Also, as he has been on vent for prolonged period,
   he is most likely weak and will require prolonged weaning course. He
   has high minute ventilations but SaO2 is good, suggesting he has lots
   of dead space and has increased RR to ventilate alveoli that are
   perfused. Patient is s/p tPa treatment, maintained on heparin drip.
   [**Month (only) 8**] also have new VAP (see below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is still +9
   L  over course of admission.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PEG tube placement to be scheduled once fevers and cultures resolve
   - heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Goal negative 1L
   today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - decrease pressure support and FiO2 as tolerated with periods of AC to
   rest
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 due to R heart strain after bilateral PE
s. Repeat
   echo shows right ventricle is no longer dilated (? still dilated-
   discrepancy in Echo report) and contractile function is markedly
   improved.  Heart sounds sound distant but echo shows that pericardial
   effusion is also improved.
   - Cardiology signed off - if hypotensive, stop diuresis, do ECHO; if
   Echo negative, THEN start ionotropic [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Can diurese a bit more aggressively, but [**Male First Name (un) **]
t let CVP <5.
   - No IVC filter given RV function has improved.
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Afebrile overnight and leukocytosis
   resolved.  Was pan-cultured [**9-28**].  Antibiotics course for aspiration
   PNA completed. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR which may be
   residual from prior infection or new VAP.
   - Continue ceftriaxone (day [**4-14**]) for positive sputum culture and
   spiking fever despite being on vancomycin
   - Continue vancomycin (day [**6-14**]) for staph in A-line cultures and MRSA
   in sputum
   - f/u cultures
   - tylenol for fever
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable at 28.5 today.  Nose still packed, no signs of
   further bleeding.  Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during
   tPa treatment, packed with absorbable packing by ENT.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation.  Hematuria resolving, attributed to trauma from prior foley
   administration. UA negative for red cell casts suggestive of kidney
   emboli. Clot has been slow to clear.  Antithrombin is normal.
   - concerns for possible sinusitis given fever.  Packing appears to be
   gauze, but ENT assures us that it
s absorbable.
   - remove small amount of packing that is sticking out
 may not absorb
   - If rebleeds, give 3 sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If
   continues to bleed, call ENT.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 79-117. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol. CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for
   long-term thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-fib/flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better
   rate control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - d/c metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation.  He did receive
   >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head
   was negative. Pt received benzos for trach on [**9-28**] so no utility in
   checking urine benzos at this time.
   -          Keep propofol off
   -          avoid benzos
   -          increase seroquel to home dose 50 mg PO BID: PRN agitation
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Social work following
   .
   # Weakness
 patient has had prolonged stay in hospital
   - PT recommendations
 out of bed to chair > 1 hr a day
   - OT consult

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, bilateral pulmonary embolisms, and right ventricular dysfunction. The patient has had prolonged respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy placement. He is currently intubated and on assisted ventilation with pressure support.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation with weaning difficulties due to bilateral pulmonary embolisms and fluid overload.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with new sputum culture showing gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR).
3. Fever and leukocytosis resolved, but new sputum culture shows MRSA.
4. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction secondary to pulmonary embolism, now improved.
5. Distant heart sounds but echo shows improved pericardial effusion.
6. Bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) treatment, packed with absorbable packing by ENT.
7. Hematuria resolving, likely due to trauma from prior Foley administration.
8. Atrial fibrillation with CHADS-2 score of zero.
9. Change in mental status with alertness off sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation with weaning difficulties.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Bleeding due to trauma during suctioning and Foley administration.
4. Hemodynamic instability due to right ventricular dysfunction.
5. Thromboembolic events due to atrial fibrillation.
6. Infection control issues with MRSA and GNR in sputum cultures.
7. Fluid overload and impaired diuresis.
8. Impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's condition and potential complications based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and management plan."

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR,
   bilateral PEs, RV  dysfunction which has improved s/p trach for
   prolonged respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: s/p tracheostomy on [**9-27**].  Pt is alert and
   cooperative.  Was on PSV at 8/5 and was placed back on AC for
   diaphragmatic rest.  Currently on AC: Vt 550, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 0.4.
   Respiratory failure likely due to bilateral Pes and fluid overload.
   Also, as he has been on vent for prolonged period, he is most likely
   weak and will require prolonged weaning course. Patient is s/p tPa
   treatment, maintained on heparin drip.  Pt may have new VAP (see
   below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is still +9 L  over course of
   admission.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PEG tube placement to be scheduled once fevers and cultures resolve
   - restart heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
 begin bridge to coumadin
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Goal negative 1L
   today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - decrease pressure support and FiO2 as tolerated with periods of AC to
   rest vs diaphragmatic rest overnight on AC
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 due to R heart strain after bilateral PE
s. Repeat
   echo shows right ventricle is no longer dilated and contractile
   function is markedly improved.  Heart sounds sound distant but echo
   shows that pericardial effusion is also improved.
   - Cardiology signed off - if hypotensive, stop diuresis, do ECHO; if
   Echo negative, THEN start ionotropic [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Can diurese a bit more aggressively, but [**Male First Name (un) **]
t let CVP <5.
   - Cards unsure about utility of IVC filter placement but will still
   pursue filter as RV has just started to recover.
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Afebrile overnight and leukocytosis
   resolved.  Was pan-cultured [**9-28**].  Antibiotics course for aspiration
   PNA completed, but pt may have developed new VAP given prolonged period
   on ventilator, currently on vancomycin. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC
   and GNR which may be residual from prior infection or new VAP.
   Consider possibility of sinusitis because of gauze packing in nostril.
   - Continue ceftriaxone (day [**4-14**]) for positive sputum culture and
   spiking fever despite being on vancomycin
   - Continue vancomycin (day [**6-14**]) for staph in A-line cultures and MRSA
   in sputum
   - f/u cultures
   - tylenol for fever
   .
   # Alkalosis:  No new ABG. Pt with metabolic alkalosis and with
   resolving respiratory alkalosis.  Metabolic alkalosis most likely due
   to contraction alkalosis as we are actively diuresing him, and he is
   not vomiting, not receiving bicarb, and is receiving TFs so OG not to
   suction.
   -Give KCl as we will continue diuresis
   -Follow ABGs
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable at 28.5 today.  Nose still packed, no signs of
   further bleeding.  Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during
   tPa treatment, packed with absorbable packing by ENT.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation.  Hematuria resolving, attributed to trauma from prior foley
   administration. UA negative for red cell casts suggestive of kidney
   emboli. Clot has been slow to clear.  Antithrombin is normal.
   - concerns for possible sinusitis given fever.  Packing appears to be
   gauze, but ENT assures us that it
s absorbable.
   - If rebleeds, give 3 sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If
   continues to bleed, call ENT.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 79-117. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol. CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for
   long-term thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better rate
   control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation.  He did receive
   >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head
   was negative.
   -          wean patient off propofol as tolerated
   -          avoid benzos
   -          start low dose seroquel
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Social work following
   .
   # Weakness
 patient has had prolonged stay in hospital
   - PT recommendations
 out of bed to chair > 1 hr a day

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, bilateral pulmonary embolisms, and right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been on heparin drip for treatment of pulmonary embolism and is being bridged to coumadin. The patient's fluid balance is still positive, indicating ongoing fluid overload. The patient is also suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and may have developed new VAP given the prolonged period on ventilator. There are concerns about sinusitis due to gauze packing in the nostril. The patient has metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction alkalosis from active diuresis. He is receiving titrated lasix drip to achieve a goal central venous pressure (CVP) of 6-16 and negative fluid balance of 1 liter today. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, persistent fluid overload, development of new VAP, sinusitis, bleeding, and atrial fibrillation."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR,
   bilateral PEs, RV  dysfunction which has improved s/p trach for
   prolonged respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: s/p tracheostomy on [**9-27**].  Pt is alert and
   cooperative.  Was on PSV at 8/5 and was placed back on AC for
   diaphragmatic rest (Vt 550, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 0.4) overnight. Back on
   PSV 5/5 this morning. Respiratory failure likely due to bilateral Pes
   and fluid overload.  Also, as he has been on vent for prolonged period,
   he is most likely weak and will require prolonged weaning course. He
   has high minute ventilations but SaO2 is good, suggesting he has lots
   of dead space and has increased RR to ventilate alveoli that are
   perfused. Patient is s/p tPa treatment, maintained on heparin drip.
   [**Month (only) 8**] also have new VAP (see below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is still +9
   L  over course of admission.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PEG tube placement to be scheduled once fevers and cultures resolve
   - heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Goal negative 1L
   today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - decrease pressure support and FiO2 as tolerated with periods of AC to
   rest
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 due to R heart strain after bilateral PE
s. Repeat
   echo shows right ventricle is no longer dilated (? still dilated-
   discrepancy in Echo report) and contractile function is markedly
   improved.  Heart sounds sound distant but echo shows that pericardial
   effusion is also improved.
   - Cardiology signed off - if hypotensive, stop diuresis, do ECHO; if
   Echo negative, THEN start ionotropic [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Can diurese a bit more aggressively, but [**Male First Name (un) **]
t let CVP <5.
   - No IVC filter given RV function has improved.
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Afebrile overnight and leukocytosis
   resolved.  Was pan-cultured [**9-28**].  Antibiotics course for aspiration
   PNA completed. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR which may be
   residual from prior infection or new VAP.
   - Continue ceftriaxone (day [**4-14**]) for positive sputum culture and
   spiking fever despite being on vancomycin
   - Continue vancomycin (day [**6-14**]) for staph in A-line cultures and MRSA
   in sputum
   - f/u cultures
   - tylenol for fever
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable at 28.5 today.  Nose still packed, no signs of
   further bleeding.  Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during
   tPa treatment, packed with absorbable packing by ENT.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation.  Hematuria resolving, attributed to trauma from prior foley
   administration. UA negative for red cell casts suggestive of kidney
   emboli. Clot has been slow to clear.  Antithrombin is normal.
   - concerns for possible sinusitis given fever.  Packing appears to be
   gauze, but ENT assures us that it
s absorbable.
   - remove small amount of packing that is sticking out
 may not absorb
   - If rebleeds, give 3 sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If
   continues to bleed, call ENT.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter at night with HR 79-117. Pt on  diltizaem PO
   and metoprolol. CHADS-2 score of zero.  Would benefit from ASA for
   long-term thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute setting.
   - If in A-fib/flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better
   rate control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - d/c metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation.  He did receive
   >400mg valium in the ICU during his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head
   was negative. Pt received benzos for trach on [**9-28**] so no utility in
   checking urine benzos at this time.
   -          Keep propofol off
   -          avoid benzos
   -          increase seroquel to home dose 50 mg PO BID: PRN agitation
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Social work following
   .
   # Weakness
 patient has had prolonged stay in hospital
   - PT recommendations
 out of bed to chair > 1 hr a day
   - OT consult

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to prolonged respiratory failure. He was initially placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but required intubation and assisted control (AC) mode for diaphragmatic rest. The respiratory failure is likely due to bilateral pulmonary embolisms (Pes) and fluid overload. The patient may require a prolonged weaning course due to weakness from being on the ventilator for an extended period.

2. Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction: The patient had right ventricular strain after bilateral pulmonary embolisms. Repeat echocardiogram shows that the right ventricle is no longer dilated, and contractile function has markedly improved. However, there is a discrepancy in the echo report regarding the pericardial effusion, which appears to be improved. Cardiology has signed off, but if the patient becomes hypotensive, an echo should be done to assess for possible pericardial effusion. If the echo is negative, ionotropic support may be initiated.

3. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient was febrile overnight but afebrile in the morning. Leukocytosis has resolved, and new sputum culture shows gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR,
   bilateral PEs, RV  dysfunction which has improved s/p trach for
   prolonged respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: s/p tracheostomy on [**9-27**].  Pt is alert and
   cooperative.  Was on CPAP/PS at 10/5 and was placed back on AC for
   diaphragmatic rest (Vt 550, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 0.4) overnight.
   Respiratory failure likely due to bilateral Pes and fluid overload.
   Also, as he has been on vent for prolonged period, he is most likely
   weak and will require prolonged weaning course. He has high minute
   ventilations but SaO2 is good, suggesting he has lots of dead space and
   has increased RR to ventilate alveoli that are perfused. Patient is s/p
   tPa treatment, maintained on heparin drip.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have new VAP (see
   below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is still + over course of admission.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PEG tube placement to be scheduled once fevers and cultures resolve
   (earliest tomorrow)
   - heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Goal negative 1L
   today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - decrease pressure support and FiO2 as tolerated with periods of AC to
   rest- plan for 2 hours CPAP/PS then 1 hour AC with AC o/n
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 due to R heart strain after bilateral PE
s. Repeat
   echo shows right ventricle is no longer dilated (? still dilated-
   discrepancy in Echo report) and contractile function is markedly
   improved.  Heart sounds sound distant but echo shows that pericardial
   effusion is also improved.
   - if hypotensive, stop diuresis, do ECHO; if Echo negative, THEN start
   ionotropic [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Can diurese a bit more aggressively, but [**Male First Name (un) **]
t let CVP <5.
   - No IVC filter given RV function has improved.
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Afebrile overnight and leukocytosis
   resolved.  Was pan-cultured [**9-28**].  Antibiotics course for aspiration
   PNA completed. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR which may be
   residual from prior infection or new VAP.  Chronic level of back pain
   makes acute process such as osteo less likely.
   - s/p 4 days of ceftriaxone for positive sputum culture and spiking
   fever despite being on vancomycin
   - off ceftriaxone [**3-12**] concern for drug fever; started cipro
   - Continue vancomycin (day [**7-15**]) for staph in A-line cultures and MRSA
   in sputum
   - pan-culture today given recent T spikes
   - f/u cultures
   - tylenol for fever
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable today.  Nose still packed, no signs of further
   bleeding.  Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during tPa
   treatment, packed with absorbable packing by ENT.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation.  Hematuria resolved, attributed to trauma from prior foley
   administration. Antithrombin is normal.
   - concern for possible sinusitis given fever.  Packing appears to be
   gauze, but ENT assures us that it
s absorbable.
   - remove small amount of packing that is sticking out
 may not absorb
   - If rebleeds, give 3 sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If
   continues to bleed, call ENT.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter. Pt on diltizaem PO. CHADS-2 score of zero.
   Would benefit from ASA for long-term thromboembolic ppx, but will hold
   off in acute setting.
   - If in A-fib/flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better
   rate control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - d/c metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Agitation/Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation but
   getting more agitated.  He did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during
   his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head was negative. Pt received benzos
   for trach on [**9-28**] so no utility in checking urine benzos at this time.
   Agitated yesterday but pt still alert and responsive - states he feels
   agitated. Exam unchanged. Pt states he took ativan prior to coming to
   hospital (denied valium). ?[**Month (only) 8**] be withdrawing from benzo's. Given
   ativan x1 for agitation yesterday with some calming but quickly wore
   off. Received PM seroquel and fell asleep. D/w attending - perhaps
   standing ativan dose (0.5mg TID).
   -          Keep propofol off
   -          Valium 5mg IV BID PRN agitation assuming he is withdrawing
   from benzos
   -          increase seroquel to home dose 50 mg PO BID: PRN agitation
   .
   # Alcohol detoxification:  Pt past the withdrawal window. Prior to
   intubation was lethargic, presumably from large valium dose.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Social work following
   .
   # Weakness
 patient has had prolonged stay in hospital
   - PT recommendations
 out of bed to chair > 1 hr a day
   - OT consult

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He has multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, bilateral pulmonary embolism, and right ventricular dysfunction. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to prolonged respiratory failure. He has been treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) for pulmonary embolism and maintained on a heparin drip. The patient's recent progress includes improvement in right ventricular dysfunction and resolution of pericardial effusion. However, he continues to have episodes of agitation, fever, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for continued respiratory failure due to bilateral pulmonary embolism and fluid overload. He requires prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown new signs of infection in his sputum culture, indicating a possible new VAP. He will need to be monitored closely for worsening respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding from the anterior pharyngeal area during tPa treatment. Close monitoring for any signs of rebleeding is necessary.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Rate control measures should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted for alcohol withdrawal, benzodiazepine toxicity, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and large bilateral pulmonary embolisms with marked right ventricular dysfunction. The patient remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and continues to experience fevers. He has been on a heparin drip with therapeutic PTT and is hemodynamically stable. Repeat echocardiogram shows improvement in RV function, and IVC filter placement has been held off due to improving RV function. The patient also has respiratory failure, generalized weakness, bacteremia attributed to line-related infection, and epistaxis with absorbable packing in place. The patient is tolerating tube feeds and awaiting percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He has completed etoh withdrawal and is being monitored for benzodiazepine withdrawal due to large doses received at admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has massive acute PE with marked RV dysfunction. There is improvement in RV function, but chronic thromboembolic disease may still be a concern.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including s/p tracheostomy and treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted for ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine toxicity, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and large bilateral pulmonary embolisms with marked right ventricular dysfunction. He remains on a heparin drip with therapeutic PTT. The patient's condition is described as hemodynamically stable, with improvement in right ventricular function. An IVC filter placement has been held off due to improving RV function. The patient also has respiratory failure, fevers, generalized weakness, bacteremia, and fluid management issues. He is tolerating tube feeds and awaiting percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for nutritional support. The patient has a history of ethanol withdrawal and received large doses of benzodiazepines at the time of admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has massive acute PE, which is a life-threatening condition. There is a possibility of further PE events due to his underlying chronic thromboembolic disease.
2. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction: The patient has marked RV dysfunction due to the PE. There is a risk of worsening RV failure and potential cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including hypoxic respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Weaning off mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy collar may pose challenges.
4. Fevers: The patient continues to experience fevers, which"

   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR,
   bilateral PEs, RV  dysfunction which has improved s/p trach for
   prolonged respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: s/p tracheostomy on [**9-27**].  Pt is alert and
   cooperative.  Was on CPAP/PS at 10/5 and was placed back on AC for
   diaphragmatic rest (Vt 550, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 0.4) overnight.
   Respiratory failure likely due to bilateral Pes and fluid overload.
   Also, as he has been on vent for prolonged period, he is most likely
   weak and will require prolonged weaning course. He has high minute
   ventilations but SaO2 is good, suggesting he has lots of dead space and
   has increased RR to ventilate alveoli that are perfused. Patient is s/p
   tPa treatment, maintained on heparin drip.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have new VAP (see
   below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is still + over course of admission.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PEG tube placement to be scheduled once fevers and cultures resolve
   (earliest tomorrow)
   - heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to goal CVP of [**6-16**]. Goal negative 1L
   today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - decrease pressure support and FiO2 as tolerated with periods of AC to
   rest- plan for 2 hours CPAP/PS then 1 hour AC with AC o/n
   .
   # RV dysfunction
 due to R heart strain after bilateral PE
s. Repeat
   echo shows right ventricle is no longer dilated (? still dilated-
   discrepancy in Echo report) and contractile function is markedly
   improved.  Heart sounds sound distant but echo shows that pericardial
   effusion is also improved.
   - if hypotensive, stop diuresis, do ECHO; if Echo negative, THEN start
   ionotropic [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Can diurese a bit more aggressively, but [**Male First Name (un) **]
t let CVP <5.
   - No IVC filter given RV function has improved.
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Afebrile overnight and leukocytosis
   resolved.  Was pan-cultured [**9-28**].  Antibiotics course for aspiration
   PNA completed. New sputum cx demonstrates GPC and GNR which may be
   residual from prior infection or new VAP.  Chronic level of back pain
   makes acute process such as osteo less likely.
   - s/p 4 days of ceftriaxone for positive sputum culture and spiking
   fever despite being on vancomycin
   - off ceftriaxone [**3-12**] concern for drug fever; started cipro
   - Continue vancomycin (day [**7-15**]) for staph in A-line cultures and MRSA
   in sputum
   - pan-culture today given recent T spikes
   - f/u cultures
   - tylenol for fever
   .
   # Bleeding
 Hct stable today.  Nose still packed, no signs of further
   bleeding.  Pt had bleeding from anterior pharyngeal area during tPa
   treatment, packed with absorbable packing by ENT.  Bleeding likely
   secondary to trauma sustained during aggressive suctioning prior to
   intubation.  Hematuria resolved, attributed to trauma from prior foley
   administration. Antithrombin is normal.
   - concern for possible sinusitis given fever.  Packing appears to be
   gauze, but ENT assures us that it
s absorbable.
   - remove small amount of packing that is sticking out
 may not absorb
   - If rebleeds, give 3 sprays afrin b/l and hold pressure 15 min. If
   continues to bleed, call ENT.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter. Pt on diltizaem PO. CHADS-2 score of zero.
   Would benefit from ASA for long-term thromboembolic ppx, but will hold
   off in acute setting.
   - If in A-fib/flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better
   rate control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - continue diltiazem 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - d/c metoprolol 12.5 TID
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting
   .
   #. Agitation/Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation but
   getting more agitated.  He did receive >400mg valium in the ICU during
   his stay with last dose 8/3. CT-head was negative. Pt received benzos
   for trach on [**9-28**] so no utility in checking urine benzos at this time.
   Agitated yesterday but pt still alert and responsive - states he feels
   agitated. Exam unchanged. Pt states he took ativan prior to coming to
   hospital (denied valium). ?[**Month (only) 8**] be withdrawing from benzo's. Given
   ativan x1 for agitation yesterday with some calming but quickly wore
   off. Received PM seroquel and fell asleep. D/w attending - perhaps
   standing ativan dose (0.5mg TID).
   -          Keep propofol off
   -          Valium 5mg IV BID PRN agitation assuming he is withdrawing
   from benzos
   -          increase seroquel to home dose 50 mg PO BID: PRN agitation

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, bilateral pulmonary embolisms, and right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and is currently intubated. He is alert and cooperative but has impaired muscle performance, posture, respiration/gas exchange, transfers, and aerobic capacity/endurance. The patient is also at risk for aspiration due to an inability to protect his airway. He has a history of chronic pain and is experiencing acute pain as well. The patient's fever and leukocytosis have resolved, but he has developed a new sputum culture showing gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, which may indicate a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has also had bleeding from the anterior pharyngeal area and hematuria, both of which are likely due to trauma. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including heparin, furosemide, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, fentanyl, and diazepam. His recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and lactate levels, while his hemoglobin and platelet count are within normal limits. The patient's heart sounds are distant, and he has markedly improved right ventricular function. He is also experiencing agitation and is being evaluated for"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged weaning course due to weakness and respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as indicated by the new sputum culture showing GPC and GNR.
3. Potential sinusitis due to packing in the nose.
4. Possible osteomyelitis given the chronic back pain and fever.
5. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines, indicated by agitation and history of receiving a large dose of Valium.
6. Delirium due to alcohol withdrawal, although the patient is past the withdrawal window.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility.
8. Stress ulcer due to prolonged NPO status and ICU stay.
9. Impaired mobility and muscle performance.
10. Risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.

s with marked RV
   dysfunction, now with trach placed.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- massive.  Remains on heparin drip with
   therapeutic PTT.  Hemodynamically stable.  Repeat echo demonstrates
   improvement in RV function.  [**Month (only) 8**] hold on IVC filter placement as RV
   improving.
   RV DYSFUNCTION -- attributed primarily to pulmonary emboli, clot
   burden.  Unclear whether component of chronic thromboembolic disease.
   Some improvement in RV function.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Multifactorial.  s/p tracheostomy.  Continue to
   work towards gradual wean to trach collar.  Currently receivieng
   treatment for VAP.
   ACIDOSIS -- +AG.  Unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely related to reduced pulmonary vascular bed.
   FEVERS -- continue to monitor.  Stool for C. diff.  Consider drug
   fever.  No clinical signs, other than cough and back pain (chronic)
   repeat CXR and check spine MRI.  Unclear sinusitis as etiology.
   Consider echo to assess for vegetations.
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- slowly improving.  Attributed to ICU
   polyneuropathy.  Continue PT consult.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU for ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine toxicity, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and large bilateral pulmonary embolism with marked right ventricular dysfunction. The patient has undergone tracheostomy placement and remains mechanically ventilated. He continues to experience daily fevers and is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has acidosis, tachycardia, and generalized weakness, which is attributed to ICU polyneuropathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - The patient has massive acute PE with marked right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. There is some improvement in RV function, but the patient remains at risk for further complications related to PE, such as recurrent PE or chronic thromboembolic disease.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure due to the massive PE and reduced pulmonary vascular bed. The patient is receiving treatment for VAP and is being weaned off the tracheostomy collar gradually.
3. Acidosis - The patient has +AG acidosis with an unclear etiology. Evaluation is in progress to determine the cause of the acidosis.
4. Fever - The patient continues to experience daily fevers, which may be due to infection (such as C. diff) or drug fever. The source of the fever needs to be identified and managed appropriately.
5. Tachycardia - The patient has a likely related tachycardia due to reduced pulmonary vascular bed. This can lead to complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac strain.
6. Generalized Weakness - The patient has generalized weakness, which is slowly improving. This weakness is attributed to ICU polyneuropathy, and the patient is receiving physical therapy consultation.
7. Bacteremia - The patient had bacteremia, which was attributed to a line-related infection. The line has been removed, and the patient has completed a course of antibiotics.
8. Epistaxis - The patient had epistaxis, which was managed with absorbable packing. There is no evidence of further bleeding.
9. Nutritional Support - The patient is tolerating tube feeding and is awaiting percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) once fevers resolve.
10. EtOH Withdrawal - The patient has undergone ethanol withdrawal and is at risk for benzodiazepine withdrawal due to the large doses received at admission. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

   .
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR,
   bilateral PEs, RV  dysfunction which has improved s/p trach for
   prolonged respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: s/p tracheostomy on [**9-28**].  Pt is alert and
   cooperative. Pt remains on AC and no vent changes made overnight.
   Respiratory failure likely due to bilateral PE
s (RV dysfunction now
   improved) and fluid overload.  Also, as he has been on vent for
   prolonged period, he is most likely weak and will require prolonged
   weaning course. Patient is s/p tPa treatment, maintained on heparin
   drip.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have new VAP (see below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is
   still +9.6L over course of admission but given hypotension will be more
   gentle with diuresis today.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PEG tube tomorrow AM if pt does not spike fever (hold TFs at MN, hold
   heparin at 6AM).
   - heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
 transition to coumadin pending PEG
   placement
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to UOP>50-100cc/hr. Monitor BP
   closely as no Central line. Goal negative 500ccL today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - decrease pressure support and FiO2 as tolerated with periods of AC to
   rest- plan for 2 hours CPAP/PS then 1 hour AC with AC o/n
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Febrile yesterday AM to 102.9.  Pan-cultured
   again on [**10-2**].  Pt
s A-line and central line both grew Coag negative
   staph aureus. Antibiotics course for aspiration PNA completed.  Pt c/o
   cough yesterday and sputum cx ([**10-2**]) demonstrates GPC, GPR (most likely
   diptheria from oropharynx) and GNR which may be new VAP or pt may be
   colonized with these organisms now. Possible sinusitis as pt had
   packing in nose. Chronic level of back pain makes acute process such as
   osteo less likely but MRI ordered as no other source for fever. CTX
   discontinued in concern for drug fever and changed to cipro.
   - Continue vancomycin (day 8) to cover MRSA
   - Continue cipro (day 3 + 3 days of CTX) for Klebsiella coverage
   - f/u cultures;
   - stop pan-culturing every time he spikes
   - tylenol for fever
   .
   #. Agitation: Pt still agitated requiring extra doses of valium
   yesterday. Pt calms down with valium suggesting agitation may be due to
   benzo withdrawal.
   -Valium 5mg IV BID PRN agitation assuming he is withdrawing from
   benzos; will give extra doses PRN after evaluation
   -Continue seroquel at home dose 50 mg PO BID: PRN agitation
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter. Pt on diltizaem PO, increased yesterday but
   pt had episodes of hypotension when given in combination with morphine
   and seroquel. CHADS-2 score of zero.
   - If in A-fib/flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better
   rate control given that pt already has some heart strain.
   - Decrease diltiazem increased to 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - Will be coumadin for PE. [**Month (only) 8**] do Aspirin once coumadin course
   completed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient has several medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on assisted ventilation due to bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and fluid overload. He has been treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and maintained on a heparin drip. The patient is weak and will require a prolonged weaning course from the ventilator.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed new VAP, as indicated by the sputum culture showing Gram-positive cocci in clusters and Gram-negative rods. The antibiotics course for aspiration pneumonia has been completed.

3. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient had a fever of 102.9 degrees yesterday, and both arterial and central line cultures grew coag-negative staph aureus. Antibiotics were changed due to concerns for drug fever.

4. Agitation: The patient is still agitated and requires extra doses of valium. The agitation may be due to benzodiazepine withdrawal.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation and episodes of atrial flutter. He is on diltiazem, which has been increased but caused hypotension when combined with morphine and seroquel. CHADS-2"

   - s/p 4 days of ceftriaxone for positive sputum culture and spiking
   fever despite being on vancomycin
   - on cipro (Last dose 8/24
 not getting??)
   - Vancomycin for staph in A-line cultures and MRSA in sputum completed
   yesterday.

   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter. Pt on diltizaem PO. CHADS-2 score of zero.
   Would benefit from ASA for long-term thromboembolic ppx, but will hold
   off in acute setting.
   - If in A-fib/flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better
   rate control given that pt already has severe heart strain.
   - Diltiazem increased to 120 mg PO QID given through NG
   - hold on ASA for now given acute setting

   #. Agitation/Change in Mental Status: Pt more alert off sedation but
   still agitated requiring extra doses of valium yesterday. Pt calms down
   with valium suggesting agitation may be due to benzo withdrawal.
   - Keep propofol off
   -          Valium 5mg IV BID PRN agitation assuming he is withdrawing
   from benzos
   -          continue seroquel at home dose 50 mg PO BID: PRN agitation

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ETOH detoxification. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and fluid overload, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, fever, leukocytosis, bleeding, agitation/change in mental status, alcohol abuse, and weakness.

Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on assisted ventilation (AC) and is weak, requiring a prolonged weaning course. He has been treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) for PE and is maintained on a heparin drip.

RV Dysfunction: The patient's right ventricle is no longer dilated, and contractile function has markedly improved. Pericardial effusion is also improved.

Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient had a fever yesterday morning and is pan-cultured again. New sputum culture demonstrates gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-positive rods (GPR), and gram-negative rods (GNR), which may indicate a new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). An MRI has been ordered to investigate the source of fever.

Bleeding: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) remains stable, and there are no signs of further bleeding from the nose with packing removal or hematuria.

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   This is a 58 year old with a history of polysubstance abuse here for
   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR,
   bilateral PEs, RV  dysfunction which has improved s/p trach for
   prolonged respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: s/p tracheostomy on [**9-28**].  Pt is alert and
   cooperative. Pt remains on AC and no vent changes made overnight.
   Respiratory failure likely due to bilateral PE
s (RV dysfunction now
   improved) and fluid overload.  Also, as he has been on vent for
   prolonged period, he is most likely weak and will require prolonged
   weaning course. Patient is s/p tPa treatment, maintained on heparin
   drip.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have new VAP (see below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is
   still +9.6L over course of admission but given hypotension will be more
   gentle with diuresis today.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PEG tube tomorrow AM if pt does not spike fever (hold TFs at MN, hold
   heparin at 6AM).
   - heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
 transition to coumadin pending PEG
   placement
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to UOP>50-100cc/hr. Monitor BP
   closely as no Central line. Goal negative 500ccL today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - decrease pressure support and FiO2 as tolerated with periods of AC to
   rest- plan for 2 hours CPAP/PS then 1 hour AC with AC o/n
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Febrile yesterday AM to 102.9.  Pan-cultured
   again on [**10-2**].  Pt
s A-line and central line both grew Coag negative
   staph aureus. Antibiotics course for aspiration PNA completed.  Pt c/o
   cough yesterday and sputum cx ([**10-2**]) demonstrates GPC, GPR (most likely
   diptheria from oropharynx) and GNR which may be new VAP or pt may be
   colonized with these organisms now. Possible sinusitis as pt had
   packing in nose. Chronic level of back pain makes acute process such as
   osteo less likely but MRI ordered as no other source for fever. CTX
   discontinued in concern for drug fever and changed to cipro.
   - Continue vancomycin (day 8) to cover MRSA
   - Continue cipro (day 3 + 3 days of CTX) for Klebsiella coverage
   - f/u cultures;
   - stop pan-culturing every time he spikes
   - tylenol for fever
   .
   #. Agitation: Pt still agitated requiring extra doses of valium
   yesterday. Pt calms down with valium suggesting agitation may be due to
   benzo withdrawal.
   -Valium 5mg IV BID PRN agitation assuming he is withdrawing from
   benzos; will give extra doses PRN after evaluation
   -Continue seroquel at home dose 50 mg PO BID: PRN agitation
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter. Pt on diltizaem PO, increased yesterday but
   pt had episodes of hypotension when given in combination with morphine
   and seroquel. CHADS-2 score of zero.
   - If in A-fib/flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better
   rate control given that pt already has some heart strain.
   - Decrease diltiazem increased to 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - Will be coumadin for PE. [**Month (only) 8**] do Aspirin once coumadin course
   completed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), and right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent tracheostomy and has been on mechanical ventilation for a prolonged period. He has received tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment and is maintained on a heparin drip. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure due to bilateral PE and fluid overload, atrial fibrillation, agitation possibly due to benzodiazepine withdrawal, fever and leukocytosis, agitation, and weakness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for a prolonged period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. His sputum culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, which could indicate a possible VAP.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient's central line culture grew coag-negative staphylococci, suggesting a potential CLABSI.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobilization and history of PE, there is a risk of developing DVT. The patient is receiving heparin drip for PE treatment, which also helps prevent DVT.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a stable hematocrit level and no signs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted for ethanol withdrawal and benzodiazepine toxicity. He has been diagnosed with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and large bilateral pulmonary embolisms with marked right ventricular dysfunction. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. He experienced transient hypotension after receiving diltiazem and morphine, which was responded to with an IV fluid bolus. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 103/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on a heparin drip with therapeutic PTT, and his repeat echo shows improvement in RV function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with a massive acute pulmonary embolism, which can lead to right ventricular dysfunction. There is also uncertainty regarding the presence of chronic thromboembolic disease.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure, and efforts are being made to gradually wean him off the tracheostomy collar. He is currently receiving treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Acidosis: The patient has +AG acidosis with an unclear etiology, and evaluation is ongoing.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycard"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted for ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine toxicity, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and large bilateral pulmonary embolisms with marked right ventricular dysfunction. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's condition has been complex, with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) - The patient had a massive PE, which caused right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. He is currently on a heparin drip with therapeutic PTT. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement was considered but held as the patient's RV function is improving.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and is being treated with mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy has been performed, and the goal is to gradually wean the patient off the tracheostomy collar. The patient is also receiving treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Acidosis - The patient has metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap. The etiology is unclear, and evaluation is ongoing.
4. Tachycardia - The patient has tachycardia likely related to reduced pulmonary vascular bed.
5. FEVERS - The patient continues to have fevers, which may be related to line infections. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been started. Other potential causes, such as drug fever or sinusitis"

   ETOH detoxfication and found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR,
   bilateral PEs, RV  dysfunction which has improved s/p trach for
   prolonged respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: s/p tracheostomy on [**9-28**].  Pt is alert and
   cooperative. Pt remains on AC and no vent changes made overnight.
   Respiratory failure likely due to bilateral PE
s (RV dysfunction now
   improved) and fluid overload.  Also, as he has been on vent for
   prolonged period, he is most likely weak and will require prolonged
   weaning course. Patient is s/p tPa treatment, maintained on heparin
   drip.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have new VAP (see below).  Also pt
s fluid balance is
   still +9.6L over course of admission but given hypotension will be more
   gentle with diuresis today.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PEG tube tomorrow AM if pt does not spike fever (hold TFs at MN, hold
   heparin at 6AM).
   - heparin drip for PE, monitor PTT
 transition to coumadin pending PEG
   placement
   - diurese with lasix drip titrated to UOP>50-100cc/hr. Monitor BP
   closely as no Central line. Goal negative 500ccL today.
   - frequent suctioning and pulmonary toliets.
   - avoid versed for sedation
   - decrease pressure support and FiO2 as tolerated with periods of AC to
   rest- plan for 2 hours CPAP/PS then 1 hour AC with AC o/n
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 Febrile yesterday AM to 102.9.  Pan-cultured
   again on [**10-2**].  Pt
s A-line and central line both grew Coag negative
   staph aureus. Antibiotics course for aspiration PNA completed.  Pt c/o
   cough yesterday and sputum cx ([**10-2**]) demonstrates GPC, GPR (most likely
   diptheria from oropharynx) and GNR which may be new VAP or pt may be
   colonized with these organisms now. Possible sinusitis as pt had
   packing in nose. Chronic level of back pain makes acute process such as
   osteo less likely but MRI ordered as no other source for fever. CTX
   discontinued in concern for drug fever and changed to cipro.
   - Continue vancomycin (day 8) to cover MRSA
   - Continue cipro (day 3 + 3 days of CTX) for Klebsiella coverage
   - f/u cultures;
   - stop pan-culturing every time he spikes
   - tylenol for fever
   .
   #. Agitation: Pt still agitated requiring extra doses of valium
   yesterday. Pt calms down with valium suggesting agitation may be due to
   benzo withdrawal.
   -Valium 5mg IV BID PRN agitation assuming he is withdrawing from
   benzos; will give extra doses PRN after evaluation
   -Continue seroquel at home dose 50 mg PO BID: PRN agitation
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation on admission
   and episodes of A flutter. Pt on diltizaem PO, increased yesterday but
   pt had episodes of hypotension when given in combination with morphine
   and seroquel. CHADS-2 score of zero.
   - If in A-fib/flutter and HR>120, give diltiazem 5mg IV PRN for better
   rate control given that pt already has some heart strain.
   - Decrease diltiazem increased to 90 mg PO QID given through NG
   - Will be coumadin for PE. [**Month (only) 8**] do Aspirin once coumadin course
   completed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, bilateral pulmonary embolisms, and right ventricular dysfunction. He underwent a tracheostomy due to prolonged respiratory failure and is currently intubated.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on assisted ventilation and is likely weak, requiring a prolonged weaning course. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which has been identified with the presence of gram-positive cocci, gram-positive rods, and gram-negative rods in the sputum culture.

2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient had a fever yesterday and pan-cultured again. Both arterial and central lines grew coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotics have been completed for aspiration pneumonia, but the presence of GPC, GPR, and GNR may indicate a new VAP or colonization with these organisms.

3. Agitation: The patient is still agitated and requires extra doses of valium, suggesting potential benzodiazepine withdrawal.

s fluid balance is
   still +9L over course of admission but given hypotension will be more
   gentle with diuresis today.
   - Out of bed to chair
   - defer PEG tube placement as patient is able to take
   - continue heparin drip as [**Doctor First Name 8545**] to coumadin

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, currently admitted for alcohol detoxification. He has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, bilateral pulmonary embolisms, and right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement on 09/28 and has been experiencing episodes of apnea while awake without desaturation. He remains intubated and on pressure support. His fluid balance is still positive, and he is hypotensive, so diuresis will be managed cautiously. The patient is being considered for long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's prolonged respiratory failure and previous episodes of apnea while awake indicate a risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The presence of bilateral PEs suggests an increased risk for further embolic events.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requires careful management to prevent complications such as stroke.
4. Infection: The patient has shown signs of fever and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. Cultures have grown coag-negative staph aureus from both arterial and central lines, suggesting a risk for further infections.
5. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient's history of alcohol abuse puts him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and malnutrition.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage in one or more arteries in the lungs. This can lead to decreased oxygenation and impaired lung function.

2. Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction: The patient's right ventricular function is compromised due to the pulmonary embolism. This can result in reduced cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which means they have difficulty breathing and are not getting enough oxygen. This can be caused by the pulmonary embolism and may require mechanical ventilation support.

4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient had an infection in the lungs related to the mechanical ventilation. This has been treated, but monitoring for any recurrence is necessary.

5. Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by an imbalance in the body's acid-base balance. The cause of this acidosis is unclear and requires further evaluation.

6. Tachycardia: The patient has a rapid heart rate, likely due to reduced pulmonary vascular bed and right ventricular dysfunction.

7. Generalized Weakness: The patient is experiencing generalized weakness, which is attributed to ICU polyneuropathy. Physical therapy consultation has been ordered to address this issue.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M admitted for etoh withdrawal, course c/b benzo toxicity, acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure, large bilateral PE
s with marked RV
   dysfunction, now with trach placed.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- massive.  Remains on heparin drip with
   therapeutic PTT.  Hemodynamically stable.  Repeat echo demonstrates
   improvement in RV function.  [**Month (only) 8**] hold on IVC filter placement as RV
   improving.  Hope to transition to coumadin once PEG placed.
   RV DYSFUNCTION -- attributed primarily to pulmonary emboli, clot
   burden.  Unclear whether component of chronic thromboembolic disease.
   Some improvement in RV function.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Multifactorial.  s/p tracheostomy.  Continue to
   work towards gradual wean to trach collar.  Completed treatment for
   VAP.
   ACIDOSIS -- +AG.  Unclear etiology, but may be related to infection
   (i.e. line-related).  Evaluation in progress.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely related to reduced pulmonary vascular bed.
   FEVERS -- Resolved.  Attributed to line-related infection.  Continue
   Vanco to complete course.
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- continues to improve.  Attributed to ICU
   polyneuropathy.  Continue PT consult.
   LINE-RELATED INFECTION -- both a-line and central line tip demonstrate
   Staph Coag NEgative.  Lines d/c'd.  Complete course of Vanco.  Echo
   (TTE) suggests abnormality of tricuspid valve
 plan TEE to further
   define, as presence of vegetation will define longer course of
   antimicriobials.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative if possible, resume lasix drip.
   EPISTAXIS -- absorbable packing in place.  No evidence of further
   bleeding.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF.  Awaiting PEG.  [**Month (only) 8**] be able to
   avoid PEG if able to tolerate trach collar and passes speech and
   swallowing study.
   EtOH -- s/p withdrawal.  Monitor for benzodiazepine withdrawal
   (received large doses at time of admission)

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male admitted for ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine toxicity, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and large bilateral pulmonary embolism with marked right ventricular dysfunction. The patient remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and has been up in a chair today, tolerating the tracheal collar. A Passy-Muir valve is in place, allowing vocalization.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 96 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 117/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight is currently 81 kg.

The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments, including the placement of a tracheostomy tube, central line tip cultures showing Staph Coag Negative, and absorbable packing for epistaxis. The patient is also on various medications, including heparin, morphine sulfate, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and others.

The patient's lab results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and electrolyte levels. However, there are some abnormalities in liver enzymes, kidney function, lactate levels, and cardiac markers.

The assessment and plan include the following:

   colonized with these organisms now. Possible sinusitis as pt had
   packing in nose. Chronic level of back pain makes acute process such as
   osteo less likely but MRI ordered as no other source for fever. CTX
   discontinued in concern for drug fever and changed to cipro.
   - continue vancomycin for coag neg staph from central line culture on

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. He has several medical complications including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, bilateral pulmonary embolisms, and right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent a tracheostomy on [**9-28**] and is currently intubated. He has experienced episodes of apnea while awake but has not desaturated. The patient's fluid balance is still positive at +9L over the course of admission. 

The patient has been diagnosed with diarrhea, hypotension, pain control (acute and chronic), impaired balance, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, impaired posture, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired transfers, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). He also has acute respiratory failure (not ARDS) and an inability to protect his airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, cough). 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test, and growth of coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus in both arterial and central line cultures. He has completed a course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia but still has an infection with gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-positive rods (GPR), and gram-negative rods (GNR), which may be a new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or colonization."

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M admitted for etoh withdrawal, course c/b benzo toxicity, acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure, large bilateral PE
s with marked RV
   dysfunction, now with trach placed.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- massive.  Remains on heparin drip with
   therapeutic PTT.  Hemodynamically stable.  Repeat echo demonstrates
   improvement in RV function.  [**Month (only) 8**] hold on IVC filter placement as RV
   improving.  Hope to transition to coumadin once PEG placed.
   RV DYSFUNCTION -- attributed primarily to pulmonary emboli, clot
   burden.  Unclear whether component of chronic thromboembolic disease.
   Some improvement in RV function.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Multifactorial.  s/p tracheostomy.  Continue to
   work towards gradual wean to trach collar.  Completed treatment for
   VAP.
   ACIDOSIS -- +AG.  Unclear etiology, but may be related to infection
   (i.e. line-related).  Evaluation in progress.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely related to reduced pulmonary vascular bed.
   ENDOCARDITIS -- Fevers resolved.  Attributed to line-related infection,
   but now with evidence for endovascular infecton (vegetation on
   tricuspid valve).  Continue Vanco to complete course.
   C. Diff -- enterocolitis.  Vanco
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- continues to improve.  Attributed to ICU
   polyneuropathy.  Continue Physical therapy.
   LINE-RELATED INFECTION -- both a-line and central line tip demonstrate
   Staph Coag NEgative.  Lines d/c'd.  Complete course of Vanco.  Echo
   (TTE) suggests abnormality of tricuspid valve
 plan TEE to further
   define, as presence of vegetation will define longer course of
   antimicriobials.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative if possible, resume lasix drip.
   EPISTAXIS -- absorbable packing in place.  No evidence of further
   bleeding.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- PO.
   EtOH -- s/p withdrawal.  Monitor for benzodiazepine withdrawal
   (received large doses at time of admission)

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted for ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine toxicity, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and large bilateral pulmonary embolisms with marked right ventricular dysfunction. The patient has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, placement of a PICC line, and removal of arterial and central lines due to line-related infections. The patient's condition has improved with treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and endocarditis. However, the patient still faces challenges such as acidosis, tachycardia, generalized weakness, and a possible tricuspid valve abnormality. The patient's current plan includes continued physical therapy, nutritional support through oral intake, and consideration for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to further define any abnormalities. The patient's disposition is planned to be transferred to a rehabilitation facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has massive acute pulmonary embolism with marked right ventricular dysfunction. This condition can lead to further complications such as right ventricular failure, hypotension, and even death if not managed properly.
2. Tricuspid valve abnormality: The patient's recent echo suggests an abnormality of the tricuspid valve, possibly vegetation due to endocarditis. This could indicate a potential need for longer antimicrobial therapy and further evaluation with TEE.
3. Acidosis: The patient is experiencing acidosis, possibly related to"
