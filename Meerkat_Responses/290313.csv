","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient did not wear CPAP overnight and was more somnolent in the morning. An arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 64 mmHg, and PaO2 of 77 mmHg on 5 liters of oxygen. The patient felt better when sitting up in a chair. Troponin level was 0.03, indicating stability. Transthoracic echo showed mild pulmonary hypertension but no left ventricular dysfunction. Ultrasound at the bedside was negative for deep vein thrombosis. A PICC line was started in the basilic vein. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory insufficiency due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, likely exacerbated by obstructive sleep apnea. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be attempted.
2. Liver hemangioma, which is currently not requiring any acute intervention.
3. Potential complications related to atrial fibrillation, such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Possible infection or sepsis indicated by elevated white blood cell count and increased lactate levels.
5. Fluid overload suggested by the presence of edema and high fluid balance.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient did not wear CPAP overnight and was more somnolent in the morning. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.33, PaCO2 64 mmHg, and PaO2 77 mmHg on 5 liters of oxygen. The patient felt better when sat up in a chair. Troponin levels were stable at 0.03.

Medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has allergies to Ambien, unknown. The patient was started on heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and furosemide (Lasix) infusion.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the overnight events. Physical examination showed mild pulmonary hypertension, fair air movement, and 3+ edema. Laboratory results include elevated WBC, Hct, and Cr levels, with normal troponin T levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include diabetes mellitus type II, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, hypercarbic respiratory insufficiency, altered mental status, anemia, acute renal failure, and liver hemangioma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to hypercarbic respiratory insufficiency and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
2. Altered mental status due to hypercarbia or other causes, which may require further investigation such as checking finger stick glucose, bolus fluids, and obtaining a head CT if mental status remains altered after noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
3. Cardiovascular complications such as cerebrovascular accident (CVA) due to atrial fibrillation, especially considering the patient's low blood pressure and potential spurious cuff reading.
4. Anemia due to gyn bleeding.
5. Acute renal failure, which will be monitored with urine output and diuresis.
6. Liver hemangioma, which does not require acute intervention at this time.

ICU care includes nutrition (NPO), glycemic control, lines (PICC line and 18-gauge), prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), communication with family, code status (FULL), and disposition in the ICU until needs for NIPPV are sorted out."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient did not wear CPAP overnight and is more somnolent in the morning. The patient's blood gas showed a pH of 7.33, indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient felt better when sitting up in a chair. Trop T level is stable at 0.03. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory insufficiency: The patient's respiratory distress, known obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome may lead to hypercarbic respiratory insufficiency. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) will be tried during the day and ensured at night.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and reasonable rate control measures need to be taken. However, the blood pressure reading of 102/47 mmHg suggests low blood pressure, which may require further evaluation.
3. Anemia: The patient had gynecological bleeding, but the hematocrit (HCT) level is stable, indicating no overt anemia at this time.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is stable, as indicated by the normal urine output and absence of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 74 year-old woman with a history of CHF, COPD on home
   O2, transferred from [**Hospital6 **] for further management of a
   newly diagnosed, 20 cm hepatic lesion, and also found to be dyspneic.
   #. Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure:  Less concern for PE
   given LENIs negative for DVT and the patient
s initial pain resolved.
   Most likely chest pain secondary to some volume overload and pulmonary
   edema which has now improved.  Patient oxygenated well on 2 L
   yesterday.  No signs or symptoms of pneumonia.
   -bronchodilators PRN
   -no further diuresis but attempt to keep fluid balance equal
   -Patient likely with some element of diastolic dysfxn and does not
   tolerate tachycardia or HTN well from a pulmonary standpoint.
   #. Hepatic hemangioma:  The finding on CT was essentially an
   incidentiloma, as patient's symptoms were on left side of chest and
   abdomen.  No evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
   -          f/u surgery reccs
   -          Hct drop last night but stable this AM
   #. COPD:  Management of dyspnea as above.  ABG is consistent with
   chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.  Obtundation
   this AM most likely secondary to hypercarbia driven by OSA and
   depressed respiratory drive secondary to increased O2.
   - nebs PRN
   -O2 Sat goal of 90-92%
   -Trial of NPPV
   #. ?Congestive heart failure:  Echocardiogram more consistent with
   diastolic dysfxn than systolic dysfxn and patient improved w/ diuresis
   and rate control yesertday.
   -Aim for equal fluid balance today
   -optimize BP and rate
   .#A. fib with RVR:  Was in SVT on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] and ventricular rate
   slowed with metoprolol 5mg IV x 1 and diltiazem 10mg IV x 2.  Required
   dilt drip temporarily but then transitioned to PO.  Difficulty
   tolerating due to relative hypotension.
   - continue aspirin but CHADS score of [**3-18**] based on risk factors--may
   benefit incrementally from warfrain as an outpatient
   - PO dltiazem as tolerated by blood pressure
   #Hypotension: Asymptomatic, quite possibly her relative hypotension
   secondary to exquisite volume sensitivity due to RV dysfxn and
   pulmonary HTN.  Probably precipitated by rapid volume change and large
   diuresis.
   -attempt to maintain euvolemia today.
   #. Chronic kidney disease:  Etiology unknown but likely represents
   diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy.  Improving.
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   #. History of uterine bleeding:  Patient is s/p dilation and curettage
   and in the midst of an extensive post-menopausal bleeding w/u at
   Brown.  OB felt no indication to anticoagulation if otherwise
   intubated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Lastname 4886], a 74-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and on home oxygen, was admitted to the ICU for further management of a newly diagnosed hepatic lesion. She was also found to be dyspneic upon admission.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure, hepatic hemangioma, COPD, potential congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient underwent a transthoracic echo which showed suboptimal technical quality but indicated normal global left ventricular function with a possible focal wall motion abnormality, mild right ventricular dilation with normal systolic function, moderate mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and a small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.

The patient's chest pain, initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary embolism (PE), resolved and is likely due to volume overload and pulmonary edema. Her hepatic hemangioma is an incidental finding and does not appear to be causing hemodynamic compromise.

The patient's COPD management involves optimizing her dyspnea, maintaining oxygen saturation between 90-92%, and considering noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). Her recent laboratory results show mild elevations in white blood cell count and tropon"

   O2, transferred from [**Hospital6 **] for further management of a
   newly diagnosed, 20 cm hepatic lesion, and also found to be dyspneic.
   #. Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure:  Differential includes
   CHF exacerbation, pneumonia, PE, and COPD exacerbation, though patient
   has no wheezes on exam.  CXR shows possible LLL infiltrate but no
   fevers consistent with pneumonia.  High risk for PE and pleuretic chest
   discomfort concerning.
   - continue levofloxacin for possible LLL infiltrate
   - lasix diuresis
   - nebs
   - hold steroids
   - CXR in a.m.
   - LENIs to evaluate for DVTs
   - consider chest CTA if LENIs negative
   - ECHO
   #. Hepatic hemangioma:  The finding on CT was essentially an
   incidentiloma, as patient's symptoms were on left side of chest and
   abdomen.  No evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
   - f/u surgery reccs
   #. COPD:  Management of dyspnea as above.  ABG is consistent with
   chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.
   - nebs
   - hold steroids
   #. ?Congestive heart failure:  Unclear whether patient has systolic or
   diastolic dysfunction.  On lasix at home and has LE edema.
   - diuresis as above
   - ECHO

   slowed with metoprolol 5mg IV x 1 and diltiazem 10mg IV x 2.
   - continue aspirin but CHADS score of [**3-18**] based on risk factors--may
   benefit incrementally from warfrain as an outpatient
   - dilt drip for rate control
   - transition to po diltiazem
   #. Chronic kidney disease:  Etiology unknown but likely represents
   diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy.
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   #. History of uterine bleeding:  Patient is s/p dilation and curettage
   and question of uterine bleeding was initial reason for presentation to
   ED.  Hemodynamically stable.
   - OB/Gyn consult
   FEN:  diabetic, heart healthy diet
   PPX:

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type II. She was transferred to the ICU for further management of a newly diagnosed hepatic lesion and acute respiratory failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 102/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula with FiO2 at 5L. 

The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, perrla (eyes), normocephalic head/ears/nose/throat, cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes within normal limits, diminished breath sounds on the right side, and symmetric chest expansion. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Extremities show 1+ edema in both lower extremities, and the skin is warm. Neurologic examination shows the patient follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and appears encephalopathic.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, sodium of 118 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 63 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, glucose of 102 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.03. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal a slightly limited exam without evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), suboptimal technical quality echocardiogram showing global left ventricular function probably normal but a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded, mild right ventricular dilation with normal systolic function, moderate mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and small pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

The patient's current medical issues include acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure, hepatic hemangioma, COPD, possible congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, chronic kidney disease, and history of uterine bleeding.

The plan includes continuing levofloxacin for possible left lower lobe infiltrate, Lasix diuresis, nebulizers, holding steroids, obtaining a chest X-ray, evaluating for DVTs with lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI), considering a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) if LENIs are negative, performing an echocardiogram, following up with surgery regarding the hepatic hemangioma, managing COPD symptoms, assessing for congestive heart failure, managing atrial fibrillation, and evaluating chronic kidney disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 74 year-old woman with a history of CHF, COPD on home
   O2, transferred from [**Hospital6 **] for further management of a
   newly diagnosed, 20 cm hepatic lesion, and also found to be dyspneic.
   #. Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure:  Less concern for PE
   given LENIs negative for DVT and the patient
s initial pain resolved.
   Most likely chest pain secondary to some volume overload and pulmonary
   edema which has now improved.  Patient oxygenated well on 2 L
   yesterday.  No signs or symptoms of pneumonia.
   -bronchodilators PRN
   -no further diuresis but attempt to keep fluid balance equal
   -Patient likely with some element of diastolic dysfxn and does not
   tolerate tachycardia or HTN well from a pulmonary standpoint.
   #. Hepatic hemangioma:  The finding on CT was essentially an
   incidentiloma, as patient's symptoms were on left side of chest and
   abdomen.  No evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
   -  f/u surgery reccs
   -  Hct drop last night but stable this AM
   #. COPD:  Management of dyspnea as above.  ABG is consistent with
   chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.  Obtundation
   this AM most likely secondary to hypercarbia driven by OSA and
   depressed respiratory drive secondary to increased O2.
   - nebs PRN
   -O2 Sat goal of 90-92%
   -Trial of NPPV
   #. ?Congestive heart failure:  Echocardiogram more consistent with
   diastolic dysfxn than systolic dysfxn and patient improved w/ diuresis
   and rate control yesertday.
   -Aim for equal fluid balance today
   -optimize BP and rate
   #A. fib with RVR:  Was in SVT on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] and ventricular rate
   slowed with metoprolol 5mg IV x 1 and diltiazem 10mg IV x 2.  Required
   dilt drip temporarily but then transitioned to PO.  Difficulty
   tolerating due to relative hypotension.
   - continue aspirin but CHADS score of [**3-18**] based on risk factors--may
   benefit incrementally from warfrain as an outpatient
   - PO dltiazem as tolerated by blood pressure
   #Hypotension: Asymptomatic, quite possibly her relative hypotension
   secondary to exquisite volume sensitivity due to RV dysfxn and
   pulmonary HTN.  Probably precipitated by rapid volume change and large
   diuresis.
   -attempt to maintain euvolemia today.
   #. Chronic kidney disease:  Etiology unknown but likely represents
   diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy.  Improving.
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   #. History of uterine bleeding:  Patient is s/p dilation and curettage
   and in the midst of an extensive post-menopausal bleeding w/u at
   Brown.  OB felt no indication to anticoagulation if otherwise
   intubated.
   FEN:  diabetic, heart healthy diet

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known lastname 4886], a 74-year-old woman with a history of CHF, COPD, and dyspnea, was admitted to the ICU for further management of a newly diagnosed 20 cm hepatic lesion. She required non-invasive ventilation support on 3/14/2122. Her vital signs were stable, but she developed chest discomfort overnight that resolved with repositioning. The patient's ability to arouse decreased in the morning, which improved after BIPAP. She experienced belly pain after lunch, but a benign belly exam was performed. Metoprolol was given for tachycardia in the afternoon. The patient's fluid balance was negative, and she required careful monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial pain resolved, and she oxygenated well on 2 L. No signs or symptoms of pneumonia were observed. Bronchodilators were prescribed as needed.
2. Hepatic hemangioma: The finding on CT was essentially an incidentiloma, as the patient's symptoms were on the left side of the chest and abdomen. No evidence of hemodynamic compromise was detected. Further evaluation and consultation with surgery were recommended.
3. COPD: The patient's ABG results showed chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation. Nebulizers were prescribed as needed, and an O2 saturation goal of 90-92% was set"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**], a 74-year-old woman with a history of CHF, COPD on home O2, was transferred from [**Hospital6 **] for further management of a newly diagnosed, 20 cm hepatic lesion, and also found to be dyspneic. The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a hepatic hemangioma, COPD, possible congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's family wishes to transfer her back to her previous hospital if possible.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia may worsen if oxygenation is not maintained at adequate levels. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygen saturation is necessary.
2. Hepatic hemangioma: Although the hepatic lesion is currently asymptomatic, there is a risk of rupture or bleeding if the patient's condition deteriorates.
3. Congestive heart failure: The patient's history of CHF and evidence of diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram suggest a possible exacerbation of heart failure. Monitoring fluid balance and optimizing medication management, such as diuretics and rate control, is important.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be dosed appropriately based on renal function.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and potential complications. The patient's chief complaint is hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, respiratory failure (not ARDS), and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 97 bpm, hypotension with blood pressure readings of 89/46 mmHg and 72/19 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 94% and the patient is on non-invasive ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at FiO2 of 30% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. The kidney function tests show a slightly elevated creatinine level. Other lab results, including liver function tests, electrolytes, and cardiac markers, are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals altered mental status and atrial fibrillation. The assessment and plan include management for hypercarbic respiratory insufficiency, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, anemia, acute renal failure, and a liver hemangioma.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation or oxygenation, exacerbation of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular events"

","Summary:
The patient is an obese woman with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, and likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory distress and altered mental status, which improved with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Her vital signs are stable, but she has mild hypotension and significant peripheral edema. She has a history of gynecological bleeding leading to anemia and acute renal failure, which is currently stable. She also has a liver hemangioma but does not require immediate intervention. The patient's medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory distress, which is a condition characterized by elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood due to inadequate ventilation. This can lead to respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
2. Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS): Given the patient's obesity and respiratory failure, there is a possibility of OHS, which is a sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by reduced ventilation during wakefulness. It can lead to daytime hypercapnia and respiratory failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heart rhythm. AF increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure if not"

","Summary:
The patient is an obese woman with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, respiratory failure (not ARDS), and atrial fibrillation. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory distress, which improved with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient has had altered mental status, which resolved with NIPPV, and her blood pressure is low but may be spurious. She has anemia likely due to gyn bleeding, but her hematocrit levels are stable. Her renal function is stable, and she is diuresing well. There are no acute interventions needed for her liver hemangioma, but transplant surgery has been discussed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, development of deep vein thrombosis due to immobility, stress ulcers from prolonged ICU stay, and potential infections from indwelling lines."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 74 year-old woman with a history of CHF, COPD on home
   O2, transferred from [**Hospital6 **] for further management of a
   newly diagnosed, 20 cm hepatic lesion, and also found to be dyspneic.
   #. Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure:  Less concern for PE
   given LENIs negative for DVT and the patient
s initial pain resolved.
   Most likely chest pain secondary to some volume overload and pulmonary
   edema which has now improved.  Patient oxygenated well on 2 L
   yesterday.  No signs or symptoms of pneumonia.
   -bronchodilators PRN
   -attempt to keep fluid balance equal
   -restart home dose of lasix
   -Patient likely with some element of diastolic dysfxn and does not
   tolerate tachycardia or HTN well from a pulmonary standpoint
   -will attempt to transfer back to [**Hospital3 291**], as family wishes to have
   patient closer at home, and no acute issues any longer.
   #. Hepatic hemangioma:  The finding on CT was essentially an
   incidentiloma, as patient's symptoms were on left side of chest and
   abdomen.  No evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
   - Per liver transplant service, will need to follow-up with liver
   surgeon as outpatient for possible resection and defer CT till then

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a newly diagnosed hepatic lesion. She was transferred from another hospital for further management of the hepatic lesion and also presented with dyspnea.

The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure, a hepatic hemangioma, COPD, possible congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, fib with right ventricular involvement, hypotension, chronic kidney disease, history of uterine bleeding, and sleep apnea.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Acute exacerbation of COPD: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to factors such as infection, exposure to irritants, or inadequate control of symptoms.

2. Worsening heart failure: The patient's history of CHF and the presence of bibasilar crackles on physical examination suggest the possibility of worsening heart failure. This can lead to fluid accumulation, shortness of breath, and other cardiovascular symptoms.

3. Hepatic lesion complications: The presence of a 20 cm hepatic lesion requires further evaluation and management. Depending on the nature of the lesion, it could potentially lead to liver dysfunction, bleeding, or malignancy.

4. Respiratory infections: The patient's compromised respiratory status makes her more susceptible to respiratory infections, such as pneumonia. Infections can further"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 74-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a newly diagnosed 20 cm hepatic lesion. She was admitted to the ICU for further management and treatment of acute-on-chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient also has chronic kidney disease, a history of uterine bleeding, and is currently undergoing an extensive post-menopausal bleeding workup.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute-on-chronic hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial chest pain resolved, and she is less likely to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) given the negative Lower Extremity Noninvasive Venous Ultrasound (LENI) for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Her symptoms may be secondary to volume overload and pulmonary edema. Bronchodilators and diuretics are being used for management.
2. Hepatic hemangioma: The hepatic lesion was incidentally found during a CT scan. It does not appear to be causing hemodynamic compromise, and follow-up with a liver surgeon is recommended for possible resection.
3. COPD: The patient's dyspnea is being managed with nebulizers as needed and oxygen saturation goals of 90-92%. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is also being considered.
4. Congestive heart failure:"
