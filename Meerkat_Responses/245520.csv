   predominantly hypercarbic with good oxygenation currently, most likely
   percipitated by pna and ubtitration of oxygen on the floor over night
   (O2Sat 100%) leading to CO2 retension. No CNS active meds, doubt muscle
   weakness to be the cause as strong respiratory rate and obviouse deep
   inspiration on exam. No history of COPD but given chronicity and
   smoking Hx as well as wheezes, this could have remained undiagnosed
   - cont pna treatment

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of pneumonia (pna), underlying lung disease, and congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/27 mmHg to 115/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has been receiving treatment for pna with antibiotics and oxygen therapy. However, the oxygen therapy has led to carbon dioxide retention. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPV) has been initiated, and intubation may be considered if NIPV fails.

The patient's hypotension is believed to be caused by a combination of factors including diarrhea, pna, and worsening renal function. A fluid bolus has been administered, and possible transfusion is being considered due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Pressors may be necessary if there is no response to fluid resuscitation.

A chest X-ray suggests pneumonia, possibly with empyema. However, good breath sounds and crackles in the lower lung field indicate consolidation rather than empyema. The patient is also on chronic prednisone, which raises concern for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), but"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). 

The patient's current condition includes somnolence, bilateral crackles in the lungs, right-sided heart failure, hypoxemia, and hypercarbia. She also has worsening renal function, anemia, and a history of multiple blood transfusions. 

The assessment and plan includes ongoing treatment for pneumonia, adjustment of oxygen therapy, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), and possible intubation if NIPPV fails. The patient's hypotension is attributed to volume loss, pre-renal azotemia, and possibly sepsis. Fluid resuscitation and transfusion are being considered. 

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hypercarbia, which should improve with decreasing CO2 levels. The patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on low molecular weight heparin (lovenox). 

Renal issues are being managed with careful monitoring of urine output and electrolyte balance. The patient's myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) requires close monitoring due to ongoing blood transfusions and renal impairment. 

The patient's DNR status was discussed with the patient and her daughter, and she is currently on a regular diet, receiving IV fluids, and prophylactic medications such as heparin."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic health conditions, including congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple drug sensitivities. She is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia (PNA) and underlying lung disease. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and tachypnea. Her laboratory results show worsening acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient has resolving hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can worsen if oxygenation is compromised.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has acute on chronic PNA, which may lead to further deterioration of respiratory function.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is attributed to volume loss due to diarrhea, worsening renal function, and possibly sepsis.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a high potassium level, which can be life-threatening and requires prompt treatment.
5. Distolic CHF: The patient has evidence of right ventricular failure, possibly due to fluid depletion.
6. Altered mental status: The patient is somnolent but arousable, likely due to hypercarbia.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 F with resolving hypercarbic respiratory failure, and hypotension in
   the setting of resolving pna and underlying lung disease and CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure/ PNA: Acute on chronic
   predominantly hypercarbic with good oxygenation currently, most likely
   percipitated by pna and ubtitration of oxygen on the floor over night
   (O2Sat 100%) leading to CO2 retension. No CNS active meds, doubt muscle
   weakness to be the cause as strong respiratory rate and obviouse deep
   inspiration on exam. Patient is on home O2 of 2L for CHF.
   - cont pna treatment with vanco zosyn, started [**3-24**], will continue to
   [**4-1**] to complete 8d course of non-pseudonomal HAP
   - standing nebs
   - non invasive pressure ventilation if worsening tachypnea, or CO2
   retension, although weaning down O2 to 4L overnight
   - DNR/DNI
   .
   # Hypotension: hx of diarrhea, current pna, worsening renal function,
   most likely prerenal due to volume los, doubt flourid sepsis
   cardiogenic. Patient has low baseline around SBP 100 and has good urine
   output currently.
   - fluid bolus prn, will give trials of 250 cc boluses to check
   - possible transfusion as MDS
   .
   # ? cellulitis
 examined legs today, LE wounds look stable. Covering
   with antibiotics for PNA.
   -          will follow clinically
   # Hyperkalemia
 5.6 this am, likely from renal failure,
   - pt refusing [**Month/Day (4) 8223**], daughter consulted and also refused
   - talked about dangers of not treating hyperkalemia but still refusing.
   - checking PM lytes
   - giving Lasix 10mg IV
   .
   # distolic CHF: mostly right ventricular failure per echo: good
   systolic function. BNP on admission significantly improved to past
   ruling out exacerbation, likely fluid depleted on exam.
   - gentle fluid resuscitation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  somnolent but arousable. not focal but
   difficult to assess as poor cooperation language barrier.
   Unlikely from hypercarbia.
   - improving today, more awake and alert
   # DVT and PE: Patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on lovenox at
   home.
   -cont lovenox, with renal failure will check factor 10a 4 hours after
   administration at trough to get true level
   - pharmacy helping with dosing
   .
   # CRI: acute on chronic. Prerenal vs ATn in the setting of hypotension
   - continue fluid boluses
   - renal lytes
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # MDS:  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Hospital1 54**].  Has received multiple
   blood transfusions in past. Current HCT drop still at range of
   baseline, no source of bleed, although need careful monitoring as on
   lovenox with renal impairment
   - may need transfusion
   - recheck in pm
   .
   # PICC placed [**3-27**]
   # Code: DNR/ DNI, (confirmed [**3-26**]) no central line or kayxealate
   # callout to CC7

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple comorbidities. She is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia (PNA) and underlying lung disease.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
- Heart rate: 67 bpm (62-96 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 88/32 mmHg (75/20-116/48 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (17-33 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula
- Heart rhythm: First-degree AV block

The patient's physical examination reveals:
- Somnolent and responsive to voice
- PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), NC/AT (no conjunctival pallor)
- Bilateral crackles in the lungs, more prominent on the left side
- Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 heart sounds with third heart sound (S3) best heard at the left sternal border (LSB)
- Soft abdomen with positive bowel sounds (BS)
- Gross bilateral edema of the extremities, warm and well-perfused

The patient has a history of chronic pain and acute pain, heart failure, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). On admission, the patient was somnolent and responded to voice commands. Physical examination revealed bilateral crackles in the lungs, a rapid heart rate, and gross bilateral edema. Initial laboratory results showed elevated potassium levels (5.6 mEq/L), low hemoglobin (9.0 g/dL), elevated white blood cell count (17.1 K/uL), and elevated blood glucose (177 mg/dL). The patient's condition has progressively worsened with ongoing hypotension, worsening acute renal failure (ARF), and difficulty managing hyperkalemia. The patient's daughter refused a kidney transplant evaluation. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with persistent hypotension and dependence on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of bilateral crackles in the lungs suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's worsening ARF, elevated potassium levels, and refusal for a kidney transplant evaluation indicate a high risk of AKI.
3. Cardiac Failure: The patient's hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 F with hypercarbic respiratory failure, and hypotension in the
   setting of pna and underlying lung disease and CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure: Acute on chronic
   predominantly hypercarbic with good oxygenation currently, most likely
   percipitated by pna and ubtitration of oxygen on the floor over night
   (O2Sat 100%) leading to CO2 retension. No CNS active meds, doubt muscle
   weakness to be the cause as strong respiratory rate and obviouse deep
   inspiration on exam. No history of COPD but given chronicity and
   smoking Hx as well as wheezes, this could have remained undiagnosed
   - cont pna treatment with vanco zosyn, improving, no need to double
   coverage GNR
   - o2 to 89-93%
   - standing nebs
   - non invasive pressure ventilation if worsening tachypnea, or CO2
   retension, although weaning down O2 to 4L overnight
   - DNI
   .
   # Hypotension: hx of diarrhea, current pna, worsening renal function,
   most likely prerenal due to volume los, doubt flourid sepsis
   cardiogenic
   - fluid bolus prn, will give trials of 250 cc boluses to check
   - possible transfusion as MDS
   - no need for pressors currently but if no response to fluid will need
   line and sepsis treatment, also given CHF low treshold for central line
   to also asses cvp
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Patcont [**Doctor Last Name **]/Zosyn. follow up culture, doubt current need
   for double coverage,
   - repeat CXRs
   - continue abx
   - fluid boluses PRN
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 5.6 this am, likely from renal failure,
   - pt refusing [**Doctor Last Name 8223**], daughter consulted and also refused
   - talked about dangers of not treating hyperkalemia but still refusing.
   .
   # distolic CHF: mostly right ventricular failure per echo: good
   systolic function. BNP on admission significantly improved to past
   ruling out exacerbation, likely fluid depleted on exam.
   - gentle fluid resuscitation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  somnolent but arousable. not focal but
   difficult to assess as poor cooperation language barrier.
   most likely due to hypercarbia, with decrease co2 expect improvment
   - improving today, more awake and alert
   # DVT and PE: Patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on lovenox
   at home. doubt massive pe to be the cause of hypotension.
   -cont lovenox, with renal failure will check factor 10a tomorrow at
   trough to get true level
   - pharmacy helping with dosing
   .
   # CRI: acute on chronic. Prerenal vs ATn in the setting of hypotension
   - continue fluid boluses
   - renal lytes
   - follow UOP
   - renaly dose meds
   .
   # MDS:  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Hospital1 54**].  Has received multiple
   blood transfusions in past. Current HCT drop still at range of
   baseline, no source of bleed, although need careful monitoring as on
   lovenox with renal impairment
   - may need transfusion
   - recheck in pm

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of pneumonia (pna), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple drug sensitivities. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, hyperkalemia, distolic CHF, altered mental status, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

The patient's medical history includes COPD, CHF, DVT/PE, and MDS. She has received multiple blood transfusions in the past. She is currently on enoxaparin (lovenox) for DVT/PE prophylaxis and has worsening acute renal failure (ARF).

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 75/20 mmHg to 88/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She requires 4 liters of supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals somnolence, responds to voice, bilateral crackles in the lungs, right-sided crackles"
