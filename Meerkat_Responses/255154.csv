   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 10607**] is a 60 y.o. F with CAD s/p IMI, CHF
   with EF 20%, SLE, scleroderma, severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home O2,
   who presents with R hip fracture as an OSH transfer for surgery, s/p R
   ORIF and transferred to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt hypotensive in PACU to 70-80s and needed peripheral
   neosynephrine to maintain pressures. Given poor urine output,
   concentrated appearing urine, cold and dry extremities, likely
   hypovolemic.  Hematocrit has been stable prior to and after surgery.
   Less likely sepsis given afebrile, lactate not elevated, but cannot r/o
   given recent surgical manipulation.
   - place CVL for access
   - serial lactates
   - follow central venous sat
   - monitor CVP and aim for goal 15-20
   - bolus for UOP of goal 30 cc/hour
   - pressors if not responsive to IVF boluses for goal MAP>65
   - monitor Hct and transfuse if bleeding, hemodynamically unstable, or
   Hct<21
   - send blood cultures
   .
   # R Hip Fracture: s/p R ORIF on [**2167-10-8**]
   - appreciate ortho recs
   - will touch base regarding lovenox dosing in AM - will need to talk
   with pain team as epidural in place
   - pain control with IV medication prn and lidocaine patch
   - f/u pain consult recs - epidural in place
   - clindamycin 600 mg IV x 2 doses per ortho
   .
   # C. difficile infection: OSH admission with + c. diff. CT scan at OSH
   with pancolitis.  ID recs at OSH: prolonged PO vanco taper 125mg PO QID
   X 14 days, 125mg PO BID X 1, 125mg daily x 1 week, 125mg QOD x 1 week,
   125mg q3 days x 2 weeks, then stop.
   - will continue PO vancomycin at 125mg PO QID
   - monitor stool output
   .
   # Systolic CHF: hold lisinopril, metoprolol, lasix given hypotension
   .
   # CAD s/p PCI to LCx:
   - continue ASA, statin
   - hold beta blocker given hypotension
   - hold Plavix for upcoming surgery given that PCI was in [**2164**]
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10607**], a 60-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including CAD s/p PCI to LCx, CHF with EF 20%, SLE, scleroderma, severe pulmonary HTN, and COPD, was admitted to the ICU for hypotension following right hip surgery. She has a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and was previously treated with oral vancomycin at OSH. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime. She is also receiving Flagyl for suspected septic shock due to C. diff. An echo showed hypokinesis of the right ventricle, which is an old finding compared to her previous records. The patient's allergies include penicillins, sulfa medications, and aspirin.

The patient has been given two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 5.5 liters of intravenous fluids for hypotension and poor urine output. The pain catheter has been removed, and she is receiving sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/57 mmHg to 129/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and"

   The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small and underfilled.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild global
   left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50-55%), although in the context
   of a small cavity size, this may be slightly underestimated. The right
   ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
   markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is
   abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
   ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated, hypertrophied and markedly hypokinetic right
   ventricle. Small left ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction.
   Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD) post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and is currently intubated prophylactically due to known pulmonary hypertension and CHF needs. She has undergone right hip fracture fixation surgery and was transferred to the ICU. The patient has been off pressors since the previous day afternoon and has responded well to fluid resuscitation. Her lactate levels have been low, and her systemic vascular oxygen saturation (SVO2) has been high. She has been afebrile for 24 hours.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension: The differential diagnosis includes C. diff sepsis, hypovolemia (possibly due to occult bleeding), and cardiogenic shock. The patient's response to fluid resuscitation suggests that hypovolemia may be a contributing factor.

2. Respiratory: The patient is intub"

   The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small and underfilled.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild global
   left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50-55%), although in the context
   of a small cavity size, this may be slightly underestimated. The right
   ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
   markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is
   abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
   ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated, hypertrophied and markedly hypokinetic right
   ventricle. Small left ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction.
   Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of CAD post-myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and a recent hip fracture. 

The patient was admitted to the MICU for hypotension after undergoing right open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the hip fracture. The differential diagnosis for her hypotension includes Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, hypovolemia, and cardiogenic shock. She has responded to fluid resuscitation and is currently off pressors.

The patient's current medications include broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, Flagyl), IV fluids, red blood cell transfusion, and prophylactic heparin. The plan includes continuing IV fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and monitoring hemoglobin levels.

The patient is also on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and may require diuretics for weaning off the ventilator. Restarting Revatio for pulmonary hypertension is also considered. Pain control measures have been implemented, and orthopedic recommendations have been appreciated.

The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which was present during her admission to the outside hospital. The ID recommendations for treating"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p IMI, CHF with EF 20%, SLE, scleroderma,
   severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home oxygen (2L NC), multiple episodes of
   C diff, meningitis in [**3-9**], prior SBO s/p surgery, who presented with a
   right hip fracture now s/p right ORIF yesterday with post-operative
   hypotension and hypoxia.
 HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
   S/p repair 2 days ago was reportedly uncomplicated. Standard post-op
   care from an Ortho perspective. Will touch base with Epidural d/c
   Trying to keep pain meds as light as we can to minimize sedation.
 .H/O C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE)
   She is on PO Vanc; will continue this for the time being. Her abdominal
   exam less tender today; it
s unclear what her baseline is. Will add
   Flagyl IV for additional coverage.
 HYPOXEMIA-intubated for hypoxemia, currently stable on PS 5/5.
   She has underlying severe lung disease from her scleroderma, on oxygen
   at home. She currently appears volume replete clinically in as that her
   SvO2 is >90% and her CVP has been in the teens, but likely not reliable
   due to RV failure.  Still bolusing periodically for low BP and low
   UOP.   Holding  Sildenafil and bopsentan while she is on pressors.
   Will try to restart sildenafil later today or tomorrow if BP remains
   stable.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): volume depletion vs infection.  Waiting for
   cultures.  BP more stable. Has not needed pressors overnight.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Afebrile overnight, BP more stable, off pressors although still getting
   boluses intermittently.  H/O c-diff, although currently no diarrhea.
   Covering for c-diff as well as other broad spectrum coverage.  Surgery
   saw to eval abd pain, but pain improved today on exam and no current
   concern for worsening colitis
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
   Holding her ACE-I, beta-blocker, and continue aspirin and Lipitor.
   -Rheum: lupus, on her home meds. No acute issues
   -Neuro: versed and fentayl, keeping as light as possible
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now.  Now BM, and recent c-diff colitis.  Will
   continue to hold for now until she has some stool output

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple episodes of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is currently being treated with oral vancomycin. The presence of fever suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent surgery may put her at risk for respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%. The use of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aspirin should be re-evaluated considering her current condition.

4. Hip fracture complications: The patient underwent right ORIF surgery for a hip fracture. Post-operative hypotension and hypoxia indicate potential complications related to the surgery.

5. Renal impairment: The patient's urine output has been low, and she has received boluses of fluids. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.

6. Gastrointestinal issues: In addition to the history of C. diff infection, the patient's abdominal exam is less tender today. However, the presence of pain and tenderness suggests ongoing abdominal issues.

7. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein throm"

   HPI:
    60yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p IMI, CHF with EF 20%, SLE, scleroderma,
   severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home oxygen (2L NC), multiple episodes of
   C diff, meningitis in [**3-9**], prior SBO s/p surgery, who presented with a
   right hip fracture. She was admitted to an OSH on [**2168-9-30**] for C diff
   pan-colitis and was d/c
ed on PO Vanc. Upon returning home, she had a
   mechanical fall and was found to have a broken hip at an OSH. She was
   referred to [**Hospital1 19**] for surgical correction. She went to right ORIF
   yesterday ([**10-8**]) afternoon. The operation was without technical
   complications. However, there is note of several hours of her having
   low to no urine out-put. In the PACU she was hypoxic post-extubation
   requiring a face mask, hypotensive requiring Neo (peripheral.) An
   a-line and pIV were placed. She came to the MICU for further care.  On
   arrival to the MICU she was groggy, without pain, and oriented to place
   but not time / year.

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p IMI, CHF with EF 20%, SLE, scleroderma,
   severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home oxygen (2L NC), multiple episodes of
   C diff, meningitis in [**3-9**], prior SBO s/p surgery, who presented with a
   right hip fracture now s/p right ORIF yesterday with post-operative
   hypotension and hypoxia.
 HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
   S/p repair yesterday was reportedly uncomplicated. Standard post-op
   care from an Ortho perspective. Will touch base with Pain regarding
   d/c
ing the epidural. Will decrease her Dilaudid dose to 0.125mg given
   she is quite somnolent this morning.
 .H/O C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE)
   She is on PO Vanc; will continue this for the time being. Her abdominal
   exam is mildly to moderately tender; it
s unclear what her baseline is.
   Will add Flagyl IV for additional coverage.
 HYPOXEMIA
   She has underlying severe lung disease from her scleroderma
   particularly given that she is on oxygen at home. She currently appears
   volume replete clinically in as that her SvO2 is >90% and her CVP is
   >15. Would hold on further aggressive volume repletion at this time.
   Would restart Bosentan; hold Sildenafil while she is on pressors. She
   may need to get re-intubated given her tenuous clinical status.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT [**Date Range **])
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Her hypotension is likely multifactorial in nature. She is on a small
   dose of Levophed currently. In the setting of her surgery yesterday,
   volume depletion is a likely consideration both from intra-operative
   blood loss and insensible losses. However, since arriving in th MICU
   she has had a persistent fever which implies some degree of
   distributive hypotension. Reassuringly her lactate was ~1, which does
   argue against significant tissue hypoxia. In addition, her EF is
   markedly low implying a cardiogenic component. Finally, PE is a
   consideration in a post-op patient. TTE won
t be particularly helpful
   in assessing this possibility as her RV was essentially
blown
 on her
   [**10-8**] (described as
overloaded and hypokinetic.
 To further clarify
   her hemodynamics, a TTE this morning will be helpful in ensuring that
   she hasn
t had an interval decrease in her EF or marked changes in her
   pulmonary hypertension. Will cycle her SvO2. With regard to her fever
   and the concern for distributive [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] f/u cultures. She needs
   empiric coverage for health care associated infections; as such we will
   add Vanc IV, Flagyl IV and Cefepime IV to her PO Vanc for broad
   coverage while cultures are pending. Provide volume resuscitation in an
   effort to take off her pressors. Will check post-op LFTs, get an
   up-right KUB and have a low threshold for pursuing further work-up of
   abdominal processes. Would check a random cortisol, TSH and consider
   checking her cardiac output with a Vigileo.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
   Holding her ACE-I, beta-blocker, and continue aspirin and Lipitor.

The patient presented with a right hip fracture and was admitted to an orthopedic surgical hospital (OSH) for surgical correction. She underwent right open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) yesterday but experienced post-operative hypotension and hypoxia. She was subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hip fracture (femoral neck fracture, femur) - S/p repair yesterday without technical complications.
2. History of C. difficile infection - Currently on PO Vanc and will continue this for the time being. Abdominal exam is mildly to moderately tender.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and multiple episodes of Clostridium difficile infection. She presented with a right hip fracture and was admitted to an outside hospital for Clostridium difficile pan-colitis. She was discharged on oral vancomycin. Upon returning home, she had a mechanical fall and was found to have a broken hip. She was referred to this hospital for surgical correction. She underwent right open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) yesterday afternoon. The operation was without technical complications. However, there have been several hours of low to no urine output. In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), she was hypoxic post-extubation requiring a face mask, hypotensive requiring neostigmine (peripheral), and an arterial line and peripheral IV were placed. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care. On arrival to the MICU, she was groggy, without pain, and oriented to place but not time/year.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and acute shock. He has a history of C. difficile infection, hip fracture, and an unknown origin fever. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 50% and has been receiving various antibiotics since admission. His vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and high oxygen saturation. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient's medical history includes a femoral neck fracture, C. difficile infection, and previous admissions for similar conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may worsen if there are further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration.

2. Septic Shock: Given the patient's acute shock and known infections (C. difficile, fever of unknown origin), there is a risk of septic shock developing if the infections progress or spread.

3. Hip Fracture Complications: The patient's hip fracture could lead to complications such as non-union, malunion, or pressure ulcers if not properly managed.

4. C. difficile Infection: The patient's history of C. difficile infection increases the risk of recurrence or worsening of symptoms if appropriate"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p IMI, CHF with EF 20%, SLE, scleroderma,
   severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home oxygen (2L NC), multiple episodes of
   C diff, meningitis in [**3-9**], prior SBO s/p surgery, who presented with a
   right hip fracture now s/p right ORIF yesterday with post-operative
   hypotension and hypoxia.
 HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
   S/p repair yesterday was reportedly uncomplicated. Standard post-op
   care from an Ortho perspective. Will touch base with Pain regarding
   d/c
ing the epidural. Will decrease her Dilaudid dose to 0.125mg given
   she is quite somnolent this morning.
 .H/O C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE)
   She is on PO Vanc; will continue this for the time being. Her abdominal
   exam is mildly to moderately tender; it
s unclear what her baseline is.
   Will add Flagyl IV for additional coverage.
 HYPOXEMIA
   She has underlying severe lung disease from her scleroderma
   particularly given that she is on oxygen at home. She currently appears
   volume replete clinically in as that her SvO2 is >90% and her CVP is
   >15. Would hold on further aggressive volume repletion at this time.
   Would restart Bosentan; hold Sildenafil while she is on pressors. She
   may need to get re-intubated given her tenuous clinical status.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT [**Date Range **])
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Her hypotension is likely multifactorial in nature. She is on a small
   dose of Levophed currently. In the setting of her surgery yesterday,
   volume depletion is a likely consideration both from intra-operative
   blood loss and insensible losses. However, since arriving in th MICU
   she has had a persistent fever which implies some degree of
   distributive hypotension. Reassuringly her lactate was ~1, which does
   argue against significant tissue hypoxia. In addition, her EF is
   markedly low implying a cardiogenic component. Finally, PE is a
   consideration in a post-op patient. TTE won
t be particularly helpful
   in assessing this possibility as her RV was essentially
blown
 on her
   [**10-8**] (described as
overloaded and hypokinetic.
 To further clarify
   her hemodynamics, a TTE this morning will be helpful in ensuring that
   she hasn
t had an interval decrease in her EF or marked changes in her
   pulmonary hypertension. Will cycle her SvO2. With regard to her fever
   and the concern for distributive [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] f/u cultures. She needs
   empiric coverage for health care associated infections; as such we will
   add Vanc IV, Flagyl IV and Cefepime IV to her PO Vanc for broad
   coverage while cultures are pending. Provide volume resuscitation in an
   effort to take off her pressors. Will check post-op LFTs, get an
   up-right KUB and have a low threshold for pursuing further work-up of
   abdominal processes. Would check a random cortisol, TSH and consider
   checking her cardiac output with a Vigileo.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
   Holding her ACE-I, beta-blocker, and continue aspirin and Lipitor.

","The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple episodes of Clostridium difficile infection, and a prior small bowel obstruction that required surgery. She presented with a right hip fracture, which was surgically corrected yesterday without technical complications. However, the patient experienced post-operative hypotension and hypoxia, leading to her admission to the medical ICU.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, likely due to her severe lung disease and oxygen dependency at home. She also has hypotension, possibly resulting from volume depletion, distributive hypotension (fever), cardiogenic factors (low EF), and potential pulmonary embolism. Additionally, she has a fever of unknown origin, which may indicate an infection or another underlying cause.

The patient is on several medications, including vancomycin, cefepime, Flagyl, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, omeprazole, and hydromorphone. She has multiple allergies to penicillins, sulfa, and aspirin. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. Her CVP is 16 mmHg, and her total fluid input/output balance shows a positive balance of 4,743 mL.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 273 K/uL, blood glucose of 101 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride of 104 mEq/L, total bilirubin of 2.4 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.05 ng/mL. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 154 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 26 mmHg.

The patient's plan includes continuing intravenous antibiotics for C. difficile infection, restarting Bosentan, holding Sildenafil while on pressors, and considering reintubation due to her t"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10607**] is a 60 y.o. F with CAD s/p IMI, CHF with EF 20%, SLE,
   scleroderma, severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home O2, who presents with R
   hip fracture as an OSH transfer for surgery, s/p R ORIF and transferred
   to MICU for hypotension, likely multifactorial
 cardiogenic vs
   hypovolemic vs sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolving. Current differential include Cdiff sepsis vs
   hypovolemia (seen with LVOF obstruction on echo) vs cardiogenic shock
   (?RV compressing LV causing decreased stroke volume). Has been off
   pressors for approximately 36 hours and has responded to fluids.
   Lactates have been low and SVO2 high. Low grade fever in last 24 hours.
   CVPs hard to monitor with RV failure (which is old.) Also hct
   downtrending with unclear source of bleeding, received 2units PRBCs on
   Friday.
   - cont IVF bolus MAP>55, levophed if needed
   -IVF for low UOP
   -cont broad coverage with Vanc/Cef/IV flagyl and PO Vanc, added
   levoflox.
   -trend hct
   .
   # Respiratory:  Intubated prophylactically, known pulm htn given IVF
   needs and known CHF, on pressure support
   Has a change with darker secections, suspicious for development of
   secondary infectious process or VAP
   - recheck sputum culture
   - add levofloxacin
   - hold on extubate today given still following commands.
   - diuresis as tolerated, aim -500 negative mL. 20mg IV lasix x1 now.
   - started sildenafil yesterday, increased to TID.
   - decrease Fi02
   .
   # R Hip Fracture: s/p R ORIF on [**2167-10-8**], pain d/ced epidural catheter
   - appreciate ortho recs
   - continue lovenox
   - pain control with IV medication prn and lidocaine patch
   .
   # C. difficile infection: OSH admission with + c. diff. CT scan at OSH
   with pancolitis.  ID recs at OSH: prolonged PO vanco taper 125mg PO QID
   X 14 days, 125mg PO BID X 1, 125mg daily x 1 week, 125mg QOD x 1 week,
   125mg q3 days x 2 weeks, then stop.
   -appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - will continue PO vancomycin at 125mg PO QID and IV flagyl
   - monitor stool output
   .
   # Systolic CHF:
   - holding on afterload reduction yet
   - consider captopril this afternoon if stable.
   - continue to hold metoprolol
   .
   # CAD s/p PCI to LCx:
   - continue ASA, statin
   - hold beta blocker given hypotension
   - hold Plavix for upcoming surgery given that PCI was in [**2164**]
   .
   # Hypoxia: likely multifactorial with COPD at baseline and poor
   pulmonary toilet with recent hospitalizations
   - continue Advair
   - ipratropium and albuterol nebs
   - incentive spirometer s/p surgery
   .
   # SLE: continue hydroxychloroquine
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: continue sildanefil. Hold tracleer
   .
   # Neuralgia: hold amitryptline and gabapentin due to sedating effects

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 10607], a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post-intramuscular injection, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen, presents with a right hip fracture after an out-of-hospital transfer for surgery. She underwent right open reduction and internal fixation but was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to hypotension, likely multifactorial cardiogenic vs hypovolemic vs septic.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Hypotension: Resolving. Current differential includes C. difficile sepsis vs hypovolemia (seen with left ventricular outflow obstruction on echo) vs cardiogenic shock.
- Respiratory: Intubated prophylactically, known pulmonary hypertension given IV fluid needs and known congestive heart failure, on pressure support.
- Right Hip Fracture: Status post right open reduction and internal fixation on [2167-10-8], pain decreased after epidural catheter.
- C. difficile infection: Positive during out-of-hospital admission with pancolitis. ID recommendations at out-of-hospital admission include prolonged PO vancomycin taper.
- Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Holding on afterload reduction yet.
- Coronary Artery Disease post-percutaneous"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD) post-intravenous myocardial infarction (IMI), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and a recent right hip fracture that required open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension, likely due to cardiogenic, hypovolemic, or septic causes.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension appears to be multifactorial, with possible causes including cardiogenic shock, hypovolemia, or sepsis. The patient has been responding to fluids and has low-grade fever.

2. Respiratory: The patient is intubated prophylactically due to known pulmonary hypertension and congestive heart failure. She is on pressure support and will be considered for extubation once sedation is off.

3. Right Hip Fracture: The patient underwent right ORIF on [**2167-10-8**]. Pain has been controlled with an epidural catheter, and the patient is receiving lovenox for deep vein thrombosis ("

   pan-colitis and was d/c
ed on PO Vanc. Upon returning home, she had a
   mechanical fall and was found to have a broken hip at an OSH. She was
   referred to [**Hospital1 19**] for surgical correction. She went to right ORIF
   yesterday ([**10-8**]) afternoon. The operation was without technical
   complications. However, there is note of several hours of her having
   low to no urine out-put. In the PACU she was hypoxic post-extubation
   requiring a face mask, hypotensive requiring Neo (peripheral.) An

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p IMI, CHF with EF 20%, SLE, scleroderma,
   severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home oxygen (2L NC), multiple episodes of
   C diff, meningitis in [**3-9**], prior SBO s/p surgery, who presented with a
   right hip fracture now s/p right ORIF yesterday with post-operative
   hypotension and hypoxia.
 HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
   S/p repair 2 days ago was reportedly uncomplicated. Standard post-op
   care from an Ortho perspective. Will touch base with Epidural d/c
   Trying to keep pain meds as light as we can to minimize sedation.
 .H/O C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE)
   She is on PO Vanc; will continue this for the time being. Her abdominal
   exam less tender today; it
s unclear what her baseline is. Added Flagyl
   IV for additional coverage.
 HYPOXEMIA-intubated for hypoxemia, currently stable on PS 5/5.
   She has underlying severe lung disease from her scleroderma, on oxygen
   at home.   Will wean FiO2 as tolerated.  On PSV 5/5, but now increased
   secretions, low grade temp.  Not ready for extubation today.  Will
   reassess daily after diuresis, antibiotics.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): volume depletion vs infection.  Waiting for
   cultures.  BP more stable. Has not needed pressors for more than 24
   hours, and no longer requiring fluid boluses to maintain BP.  Trying
   small amount of diuresis today
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Afebrile overnight, BP more stable, off pressors although still getting
   boluses intermittently.  H/O c-diff, although currently no diarrhea.
   Covering for c-diff as well as other broad spectrum coverage.  Surgery
   saw to eval abd pain, but pain improved today on exam and no current
   concern for worsening colitis. Increased secretions today, thick and
   tan in color.  On broad spectrum antiniotics and WBC trending down.
   Sending repeat sputum culture today.  Adding levofloxacin for full VAP
   coverage pending sputum gram stain.
   -PULMONARY HTN:  Started [**Hospital1 7**] sildenafil yesterday, and will titrate up
   to TID today (home dose).  Our pharmacy does not carry bosentan, but
   will consider alternate vs. getting her bosentan getting brought in
   from home.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
   Holding her ACE-I, beta-blocker, and continue aspirin and Lipitor.
   -Rheum: lupus, on her home meds. No acute issues
   -Neuro: versed and fentayl, keeping as light as possible

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed her hospital course, and
   was present for the key portions of the services provided.  I have
   reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note and agree with her findings and plan of care.
   The patient remains on low level support on the ventilator but is
   tachycardic,  perhaps due to decreased RV stroke volume in the setting
   of her pulm htn or ongoing infection (though WBC stable at 12K).
   Sildenafil has been added back for her pulm htn, and hopefully Bosentan
   tomorrow.  I suspect one should optimize her pulm htn/RV failure Rx and
   also optimize any purulent sputum before extubation attempt.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple episodes of Clostridium difficile infection, meningitis, and a history of small bowel obstruction surgery. She presented with a right hip fracture and was admitted to the hospital. She underwent right open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery yesterday but experienced post-operative hypotension and hypoxia. 

The patient is currently intubated for hypoxemia and is on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. She has a history of severe lung disease due to scleroderma and is on home oxygen. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. She is sedated and unable to follow commands but nods yes when asked if she can hear. 

Her physical examination reveals tachycardia, regular rhythm, rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally, soft abdomen with mild distension, and edematous arms and legs. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12"

   HPI:
    60yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p IMI, CHF with EF 20%, SLE, scleroderma,
   severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home oxygen (2L NC), multiple episodes of
   C diff, meningitis in [**3-9**], prior SBO s/p surgery, who presented with a
   right hip fracture. She was admitted to an OSH on [**2168-9-30**] for C diff
   pan-colitis and was d/c
ed on PO Vanc. Upon returning home, she had a
   mechanical fall and was found to have a broken hip at an OSH. She was
   referred to [**Hospital1 19**] for surgical correction. She went to right ORIF
   yesterday ([**10-8**]) afternoon. The operation was without technical
   complications. However, there is note of several hours of her having
   low to no urine out-put. In the PACU she was hypoxic post-extubation
   requiring a face mask, hypotensive requiring Neo (peripheral.) An
   a-line and pIV were placed. She came to the MICU for further care.  On
   arrival to the MICU she was groggy, without pain, and oriented to place
   but not time / year.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen, multiple episodes of Clostridium difficile infection, and a previous small bowel obstruction surgery. She presented with a right hip fracture and was admitted to the hospital. She underwent right open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery yesterday but experienced post-operative hypotension and hypoxia. She is currently intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hip Fracture (Femoral Neck Fracture, Femur): The patient had a right hip fracture and underwent surgery for ORIF. Post-operative complications such as infection, non-union, or implant-related issues may occur.
2. Clostridium Difficile Infection (C. Diff, C. difficile colitis, Clostridium difficile): The patient has a history of multiple episodes of C. diff infection. She is currently on PO Vanc and will continue this for the time being. Additional coverage with Flagyl IV has been added.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient is intubated for hypoxemia and currently stable on PSV 5/5. She has underlying severe lung disease due to scleroderma and requires supplemental oxygen at home. Weaning of FiO"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p IMI, CHF with EF 20%, SLE, scleroderma,
   severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home oxygen (2L NC), multiple episodes of
   C diff, meningitis in [**3-9**], prior SBO s/p surgery, who presented with a
   right hip fracture now s/p right ORIF yesterday with post-operative
   hypotension and hypoxia.
 HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
   S/p repair 2 days ago was reportedly uncomplicated. Standard post-op
   care from an Ortho perspective. Will touch base with Epidural d/c
   Trying to keep pain meds as light as we can to minimize sedation.
 .H/O C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE)
   She is on PO Vanc; will continue this for the time being. Her abdominal
   exam less tender today; it
s unclear what her baseline is. Will add
   Flagyl IV for additional coverage.
 HYPOXEMIA-intubated for hypoxemia, currently stable on PS 5/5.
   She has underlying severe lung disease from her scleroderma, on oxygen
   at home. She currently appears volume replete clinically in as that her
   SvO2 is >90% and her CVP has been in the teens, but likely not reliable
   due to RV failure.  Still bolusing periodically for low BP and low
   UOP.   Holding  Sildenafil and bopsentan while she is on pressors.
   Will try to restart sildenafil later today or tomorrow if BP remains
   stable.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): volume depletion vs infection.  Waiting for
   cultures.  BP more stable. Has not needed pressors overnight.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Afebrile overnight, BP more stable, off pressors although still getting
   boluses intermittently.  H/O c-diff, although currently no diarrhea.
   Covering for c-diff as well as other broad spectrum coverage.  Surgery
   saw to eval abd pain, but pain improved today on exam and no current
   concern for worsening colitis
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
   Holding her ACE-I, beta-blocker, and continue aspirin and Lipitor.
   -Rheum: lupus, on her home meds. No acute issues
   -Neuro: versed and fentayl, keeping as light as possible

   SvO2 is >90% and her CVP has been in the teens, but likely not reliable
   due to RV failure.  Still bolusing periodically for low BP and low
   UOP.   Holding  Sildenafil and bopsentan while she is on pressors.
   Will try to restart sildenafil later today or tomorrow if BP remains
   stable.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): volume depletion vs infection.  Waiting for
   cultures.  BP more stable. Has not needed pressors overnight.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Afebrile overnight, BP more stable, off pressors although still getting
   boluses intermittently.  H/O c-diff, although currently no diarrhea.
   Covering for c-diff as well as other broad spectrum coverage.  Surgery
   saw to eval abd pain, but pain improved today on exam and no current
   concern for worsening colitis
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
   Holding her ACE-I, beta-blocker, and continue aspirin and Lipitor.
   -Rheum: lupus, on her home meds. No acute issues
   -Neuro: versed and fentayl, keeping as light as possible

","The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, multiple episodes of Clostridium difficile infection, and a prior small bowel obstruction status post surgery. She presented with a right hip fracture and was admitted to another hospital for Clostridium difficile pancolitis and was discharged on oral vancomycin. Upon returning home, she had a mechanical fall and was found to have a broken hip. She was referred to Hospital1 for surgical correction and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) yesterday afternoon. However, the operation was without technical complications. 

Postoperatively, the patient experienced low to no urine output, hypoxia requiring a face mask, and hypotension requiring neostigmine (peripheral). An arterial line and peripheral IV were placed. She came to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care. On arrival, she was groggy, without pain, and oriented to place but not time/year.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), and aspirin. The last doses of antibiotics she received were clindamycin on 10/9/2167 at 09:46 AM, cefepime on 10/11/2167 at 12:00 AM, metronidazole on 10/11/2167 at 04:00 AM, and vancomycin on 10/11/2167 at 07:30 AM.

Her vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.5 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius (99.7 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 111 beats per minute (95-113 bpm), blood pressure of 116/63 mmHg (81/59-74/90 mmHg), respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute (25-32 bpm), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 385 mL (232-459 mL), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 80, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 158.

The patient's laboratory values include a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.6 g/dL, leukocyte (WBC) count of 12.1 thousand cells/microliter (13.2-12.3 thousand cells/microliter), platelet (Plt) count of 273 thousand cells/microliter (308-298 thousand cells/microliter), creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg/dL (0.8-0.9 mg/dL), troponin-T level of 0.05 ng/mL (489/8/0.05 ng/mL), lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L, and blood glucose level of 101 mg/dL (81 mg/dL).

The patient's assessment and plan include a diagnosis of hip fracture, post-operative hypotension and hypoxia, Clostridium difficile infection, hypoxemia, hypotension (not in shock), and fever of unknown origin. The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection, restarting sildenafil and bosphentan later today or tomorrow if blood pressure remains stable, holding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), beta-blocker, and continuing aspirin and atorvastatin (Lipitor). The patient's pain is improving, and there is no current concern for worsening colitis."

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, other shock, fever of unknown origin, hip fracture, Clostridium difficile infection, hypoxemia, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also on multiple IV medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further complications related to the hip fracture. It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, as well as their fluid balance and blood pressure to prevent any complications associated with the use of mechanical ventilation and critical care management."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, multiple episodes of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, meningitis in the past, prior small bowel obstruction (SBO) that required surgery, and a recent hip fracture. She presented with a mechanical fall at an outside hospital (OSH) and was found to have a broken hip. She underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery yesterday afternoon. Postoperatively, she experienced several hours of low to no urine output. In the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), she was hypoxic post-extubation and required a face mask, as well as hypotensive requiring neostigmine (peripheral). An arterial line and peripheral intravenous (IV) were placed. She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for further care. On arrival, she was groggy, without pain, and oriented to place but not time/year.

24-hour events include restarting sildenafil and placing an arterial line. The patient has allergies to penicillins, causing hives; sulfa (sulfon"

The patient has a history of hip fracture, Clostridium difficile infection, hypoxemia, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient's temperature is 101.1°F (38.4°C), blood pressure is 125/69 mmHg (89/51 mmHg), heart rate is 109 bpm (100-124 bpm), respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute (15-37 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is 100% on FiO2 of 50%. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which may indicate an infection leading to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to impaired ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which can lead to colitis and wors"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, who presents with a right hip fracture as an out-of-hospital (OSH) transfer for surgery, subsequent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension, likely multifactorial cardiogenic vs hypovolemic vs septic.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications that need to be managed while in the ICU. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which is now resolving. The differential diagnosis includes cardiogenic shock, hypovolemia due to left ventricular outflow obstruction on echocardiogram, or sepsis. The patient has responded well to fluids and is off pressors for approximately 36 hours, with low lactate levels and high systemic vascular oxygen delivery (SVO2). However, there is a concern for unclear bleeding leading to a decrease in hemoglobin concentration (hct), and the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on Friday.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 10607] is a 60-year-old female patient with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-in myocardial infarction (IMI), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, who presents with a right hip fracture as an out-of-hospital transfer for surgery. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension, likely multifactorial cardiogenic vs hypovolemic vs septic shock.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need attention. These include hypotension, respiratory support, right hip fracture, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), systolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to left circumflex artery (LCx), hypoxia, systemic lupus erythematosus, pulmonary hypertension, and neuralgia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to cardiogenic, hypovolemic, or septic shock. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic parameters is crucial to assess the patient's condition and response to treatment.
2. Respiratory Support: The patient is intubated and receiving pressure support. Close"

ed on PO Vanc. Upon returning home, she had a
   mechanical fall and was found to have a broken hip at an OSH. She was
   referred to [**Hospital1 19**] for surgical correction. She went to right ORIF
   yesterday ([**10-8**]) afternoon. The operation was without technical
   complications. However, there is note of several hours of her having
   low to no urine out-put. In the PACU she was hypoxic post-extubation
   requiring a face mask, hypotensive requiring Neo (peripheral.) An
   a-line and pIV were placed. She came to the MICU for further care.  On
   arrival to the MICU she was groggy, without pain, and oriented to place

The patient presented with a right hip fracture and was admitted to another hospital for Clostridium difficile pan-colitis. She was discharged on oral vancomycin. Upon returning home, she had a mechanical fall resulting in a broken hip and was referred to Hospital1 for surgical correction. The operation was successful without technical complications. However, the patient experienced low to no urine output, hypoxia post-extubation, and hypotension requiring neor peripheral. An arterial line and peripheral IV were placed. The patient was transferred to the MICU for further care. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 125/69 mmHg to 90/51 mmHg, heart rate of 109 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-infarction myocardial ischemia (IMI), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, multiple episodes of Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and a history of small bowel obstruction (SBO) surgery. The patient presented with a right hip fracture and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery yesterday. 

The patient has been experiencing hypotension and hypoxia post-operatively, which required the placement of an arterial line and peripheral intravenous (IV) access. She is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.  To that I would add the
   following:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 10607**] has had her bosentan and sildenafil restarted.
   Still tachypneic to 30s on 10cmH20 of pressure support.  Would hope
   that with pulmonary HTN regimen back on board, she can be extubated in
   next 1-2 days.  Pt is critically ill.  Time spent: 30 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, multiple episodes of Clostridium difficile infection, and a history of small bowel obstruction surgery. She presented with a right hip fracture and was admitted to an outside hospital for Clostridium difficile pan-colitis and was discharged on PO Vanc. After returning home, she had a mechanical fall and was found to have a broken hip. She was referred to Hospital1 for surgical correction. She underwent right open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) yesterday afternoon. However, she experienced several hours of low to no urine output. In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), she was hypoxic post-extubation requiring a face mask and hypotensive requiring Neo (peripheral). An arterial line and peripheral IV were placed. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care. On arrival, she was groggy, without pain, and oriented to place but not time/year.

24-hour events:
- CT head last night due to decreased responsiveness after being off sedation for a day - no acute process seen.
- Mental status improved today.
- Did well on pressure support"

   at home.   Will wean FiO2 as tolerated.  On PSV 5/5,alternating with
   [**10-5**].  Trying to optimize her pulm HTN regimen before extubation, but
   may be ready tomorrow.
 CV: Initially hypotensive, volume depletion vs infection.  BP has
   stabilized.  Titrating up pulm HT N meds as tolerated.  Now somewhat
   fluid overloaded on exam.  Diuresing gently.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Recent cdiff, and urine cx positive with gram neg rods from [**10-9**].
   Sputum has been negative.  Will continue po vanco for cdiff and
   cefepime for the urine, and DC all other antibiotics.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10607**] is a 60 y.o. F with CAD s/p IMI, CHF with EF 20%, SLE,
   scleroderma, severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home O2, who presents with R
   hip fracture as an OSH transfer for surgery, s/p R ORIF and transferred
   to MICU for hypotension, likely multifactorial
 cardiogenic vs
   hypovolemic vs sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Resolving. Current differential include Cdiff sepsis vs
   hypovolemia (seen with LVOF obstruction on echo) vs cardiogenic shock
   (?RV compressing LV causing decreased stroke volume). Has been off
   pressors for approximately 36 hours and has responded to fluids.
   Lactates have been low and SVO2 high. Low grade fever in last 24 hours.
   CVPs hard to monitor with RV failure (which is old.) Also hct
   downtrending with unclear source of bleeding, received 2units PRBCs on
   Friday.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-infarction myocardial ischemia (IMI), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, who presented with a right hip fracture as an out-of-state hospital transfer for surgery, subsequently underwent right open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension, likely multifactorial cardiogenic vs hypovolemic vs septic.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been hypotensive but is now responding to fluids.
- There is a low-grade fever in the last 24 hours.
- Central venous pressures (CVPs) are difficult to monitor due to right ventricular failure (RVF), which is old.
- Hematocrit (Hct) is trending down with an unclear source of bleeding.
- The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on Friday.
- Intubated prophylactically due to known pulmonary hypertension and CHF needs.
- The patient is on pressure support and needs more optimization before extubation.
- Started sildenafil yesterday and increased to three times a day.
- Decrease FiO2 as possible.

Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe pulmonary hypertension (SLE), scleroderma, chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, COPD on home oxygen, and a recent right hip fracture who presented with hypotension. She underwent right open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for the hip fracture and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management.

The patient's current conditions include resolving hypotension, low-grade fever, right ventricular (RV) failure, and unclear source of bleeding. She is being treated with intravenous fluids (IVF), vasopressors, and diuretics. Her respiratory status is being closely monitored due to known pulmonary hypertension and CHF, and she is currently intubated on pressure support. The plan is to optimize her condition before considering extubation.

The patient also has a history of C. difficile infection, which was diagnosed during her previous admission. The ID recommendations include a prolonged tapering course of oral vancomycin. Additionally, she has a history of CAD, which underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the past. The plan is to continue antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and statin.

Other medical conditions include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and scleroderma, for which she is taking"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, who presented with a right hip fracture as an out-of-hospital transfer for surgery. She underwent right open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension, likely multifactorial cardiogenic vs hypovolemic vs septic.

The patient has been off pressors for approximately 36 hours and has responded to fluids. Her lactates have been low and systemic vascular oxygen saturation (SVO2) high. She developed a low-grade fever in the last 24 hours. Central venous pressures (CVPs) are difficult to monitor due to right ventricular (RV) failure. Her hematocrit (Hct) is downtrending with an unclear source of bleeding, and she received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on Friday.

The patient's respiratory status is intubated prophylactically due to known pulmonary hypertension needs and known CHF. She is on pressure support and needs more optimization before extubation. She"

Ms. [Known Lastname 10607] is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-intravenous medication infusion (IMI), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, who presents with a right hip fracture as an out-of-hospital transfer for surgery. She was previously intubated due to hypotension, likely multifactorial cardiogenic versus hypovolemic versus septic shock. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she is now extubated. She has a low-grade fever, C. difficile infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), and a history of R hip fracture surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of CAD, CHF, and low ejection fraction puts her at risk for cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by inadequate blood flow to meet the body's needs.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's hypotension could be attributed to hypovolemia, possibly due to internal bleeding indicated by a decreasing hematocrit level.
3. Sepsis: The presence of fever, UTI, and C. difficile infection raises concerns about sepsis, a life-threatening condition resulting from"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes a history of C. difficile infection, hip fracture, and previous antibiotic use. Allergies are reported to penicillins, sulfa, and aspirin. Vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Physical examination reveals scattered end-expiratory wheezes, diminished breath sounds at the bases, trace lower extremity edema, cyanosis in the left third toe, and right first and fifth digits. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.3 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal coagulation profiles. Imaging studies show no evidence of bowel obstruction. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 40% and is receiving IV fluids and medications. The patient's condition is complicated by urinary tract infection, impaired arousal and attention, impaired ventilation, impaired range of motion, respiratory failure, shock, fever of unknown origin, hip fracture, and hypoxemia. ICU care includes nutritional support, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing impaired ventilation and respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to prevent further deterioration."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent right hip fracture that required open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for multifactorial distributive shock, which has since resolved. 

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, sinus arrhythmia controlled with metoprolol, fever of unclear etiology despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, right heart failure with mild right ventricular volume overload, and chronic conditions such as CAD, SLE, and scleroderma.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on 40% face tent oxygen but remains tachypneic. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient's respiratory status does not improve.
2. Right heart failure: The patient has evidence of right heart failure, which can lead to further pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular strain.
3. Fever of unclear etiology: Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the patient has a persistent fever. This could indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying cause.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a sinus arr"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), chronic left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and a recent right hip fracture that underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for multifactorial distributive shock. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Shock: Resolved with transient pressor requirement and fluid resuscitation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is stable on 40% face tent but remains tachypneic with mild right ventricular (RV) volume overload. Repeat sputum culture as prior, gentle diuresis to offload RV if tachypneic, wean O2 to maintain saturation above 92%, and use acapella valve.
3. MAT vs sinus arrhythmia: The patient's blood pressure is stable but the heart rate is suboptimally controlled. Uptitrate metoprolol to 50 mg three times daily to slow the heart rate, improve filling time, and improve cardiac output.

She presented to the hospital after sustaining a right hip fracture and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to multifactorial distributive shock. 

The patient's current condition includes resolved shock with transient pressor requirement and fluid resuscitation, stable respiratory status on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) but remaining tachypneic with mild right ventricular (RV) volume overload, sinus arrhythmia controlled with metoprolol, fever of unclear etiology, pulmonary hypertension secondary to right heart failure, and a history of right hip fracture with ORIF. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L, and elevated troponin-T level of 489. The chest X-ray reveals bibasilar atelectasis without new focal consolidation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx). She also has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent right hip fracture that required open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient presented to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and multifactorial distributive shock. She was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension leading to right heart failure, and her condition was complicated by a urinary tract infection (UTI), fever of unknown origin, right hip fracture, and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains stable but she is occasionally tachypneic with mild right ventricular (RV) volume overload. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status is recommended, along with gentle diuresis to offload RV if tachypneic, weaning O2 to maintain saturation between 88-94%, and using an acapella valve.
2. Shock: The patient previously experienced multifactorial distributive shock, which has resolved but may require continuous monitoring of hemodynamics and further management as needed.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient is hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery. She also has a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent right hip fracture that required open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory failure and distributive shock. She remains in the ICU due to various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently stable on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FT), but remains tachypneic with mild right ventricular (RV) volume overload. Gentle diuresis may be considered to offload the RV if tachypnea persists. Oxygen therapy should be weaned to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.

2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension secondary to her RV dysfunction. She is already on sildenafil and bosentan for this condition. Gentle diuresis may help decrease the burden on the RV.

3. Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of right heart failure due to her severe pulmonary hypertension. Diuretics may be used for volume overload, and the patient should be monitored for signs of worsening heart failure.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery, and a recent right hip fracture treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory failure and multifactorial distributive shock.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an acapella valve.

Physical examination reveals scattered end-expiratory wheezes bilaterally and diminished breath sounds at the bases. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and cyanosis in the left third digit and right first and fifth digits. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Coagulation studies reveal prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), right heart failure (RHF), chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent right hip fracture that required open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory failure and multifactorial distributive shock. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which has been stabilized with mechanical ventilation. However, she remains tachypneic and has mild right ventricular (RV) volume overload. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and weaning of oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 92% are recommended.

2. Heart Failure: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Gentle diuresis may be needed to offload the RV if tachypnea persists. Long-term management with medications such as sildenafil and bosentan may also be necessary.

3. Shock: The patient experienced transient shock that resolved with fluid resuscitation and pressor support. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamics is advised to ensure stability.

4. Urinary Tract Infection"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery, severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) resulting in right heart failure, chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. The patient presented to the hospital after a right hip fracture and underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory failure and multifactorial distributive shock.

The patient's current medical issues include shock (resolved), respiratory failure, MAT vs sinus arrhythmia, fever of unclear etiology, pulmonary hypertension secondary to right heart failure, right hip fracture status post ORIF, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FT) set at 40%.

The plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection (UTI), weaning off oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%, gentle diuresis to offload the right ventricle if tachypneic, and titrating beta-blockers to slow heart rate, improve filling time, and improve cardiac output. The patient will continue with low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis"
