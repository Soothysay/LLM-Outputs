   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure. Patient with increased WOB, tachypnea,
   and hypoxemia. She has received multiple blood product transfusions in
   the past three days, and is 6L positive fluid balance since admission.
   She has also been febrile to 104, and has a leukocytosis which has
   responded somewhat to leukopheresis. Likely causes would include
   pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload, pulmonary hemorrhage,
   TRALI, leukostasis, or pneumonia. Patient is functionally neutropenic
   so would be at high risk for infection.
   -Will attempt BiPap for 30 minutes; need to consider intubation as
   patient appears to be tiring out.
   -Will continue leukopheresis on a daily basis
   -Check blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -Echo shows no evidence of RWMA, depressed EF
   -Will give Lasix 40 mg IV prn goal negative 1-2L/day
   -Continue vancomycin and aztreonam for now; add atypical coverage
   -Would hold off on aggressive transfusions now in the setting of
   possible volume overload/TRALI
   -Will likely need bronchoscopy; will hold off until patient intubated
   .
   #. APML. Patient with 15-17 translocation. Patient with minimal
   reduction in WBC count on plasmapheresis and cytarabine. Patient also
   with DIC. Expect improvement with initiation of ATRA but unable to
   initiate in the setting of marked leukocytosis.
   -Continue pheresis for now with hopes of reducing WBC count
   -Will d/w onc continuation of ara-C in the setting of febrile
   neutropenia and respiratory decompensation
   -Following CBC, coags, fibrinogen, tumor lysis labs q4h.
   -Continue giving cryo to maintain fibrinogen > 100; would hold off on
   further blood products for now unless evidnece of active bleeding
   -Continue allopurinol 150 mg qd
   -Will continue hydroxyurea per onc recs
   -Hold off on IVF with bicarbonate for now
   .
   #. Febrile neutropenia. Patient with sources including IJ, lungs. No
   clear infiltrate on CXR.
   -Will continue vancomycin/aztreonem
   -Would add atypical coverage with azithromycin/levofloxacin
   -Panculture - sputum cultures, blood cultures, urine cultures,
   influenza DFA, urine legionella, c. difficile, CMV VL
   -Bronchoscopy if intubated
   .
   #. Increased LFTs: Patient with unremarkable hepatitis serologies and a
   negative liver ultrasound. Unlikely to be med effect.
   -Will follow synthetic function
   .
   # HTN: Currently on metroprolol alone.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue on levothyroxine at outpatient dose.
   .
   # GERD: Continue on ranitidine as per home regimen.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding on lipitor for now given elevated
   transaminases.

The patient experienced multiple events, including the initiation of multi-lumen support, blood culture, non-invasive ventilation, and discontinuation of non-invasive ventilation. She also developed a fever of 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient reported increased dyspnea with wheezing and occasional cough. She has allergies to penicillins and hives. She received vancomycin and aztreonam antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs showed tachycardia with a heart rate of 110-119 beats per minute, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and slightly elevated body temperature. The patient's oxygen saturation remained at 98% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure. Patient with increased WOB, tachypnea,
   and hypoxemia. She has received multiple blood product transfusions in
   the past three days, and is 6L positive fluid balance since admission.
   She has also been febrile to 104, and has a leukocytosis which has
   responded somewhat to leukopheresis. Likely causes would include
   pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload, pulmonary hemorrhage,
   TRALI, leukostasis, or pneumonia. Patient is functionally neutropenic
   so would be at high risk for infection.
   -Will attempt BiPap for 30 minutes; need to consider intubation as
   patient appears to be tiring out.
   -Will continue leukopheresis on a daily basis
   -Check blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -Echo shows no evidence of RWMA, depressed EF
   -Will give Lasix 40 mg IV prn goal negative 1-2L/day
   -Continue vancomycin and aztreonam for now; add atypical coverage
   -Would hold off on aggressive transfusions now in the setting of
   possible volume overload/TRALI
   -Will likely need bronchoscopy; will hold off until patient intubated
   .
   #. APML. Patient with 15-17 translocation. Patient with minimal
   reduction in WBC count on plasmapheresis and cytarabine. Patient also
   with DIC. Expect improvement with initiation of ATRA but unable to
   initiate in the setting of marked leukocytosis.
   -Continue pheresis for now with hopes of reducing WBC count
   -Will d/w onc continuation of ara-C in the setting of febrile
   neutropenia and respiratory decompensation
   -Following CBC, coags, fibrinogen, tumor lysis labs q4h.
   -Continue giving cryo to maintain fibrinogen > 100; would hold off on
   further blood products for now unless evidnece of active bleeding
   -Continue allopurinol 150 mg qd
   -Will continue hydroxyurea per onc recs
   -Hold off on IVF with bicarbonate for now
   .
   #. Febrile neutropenia. Patient with sources including IJ, lungs. No
   clear infiltrate on CXR.
   -Will continue vancomycin/aztreonem
   -Would add atypical coverage with azithromycin/levofloxacin
   -Panculture - sputum cultures, blood cultures, urine cultures,
   influenza DFA, urine legionella, c. difficile, CMV VL
   -Bronchoscopy if intubated
   .
   #. Increased LFTs: Patient with unremarkable hepatitis serologies and a
   negative liver ultrasound. Unlikely to be med effect.
   -Will follow synthetic function
   .
   # HTN: Currently on metroprolol alone.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue on levothyroxine at outpatient dose.
   .
   # GERD: Continue on ranitidine as per home regimen.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding on lipitor for now given elevated
   transaminases.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath. The patient received 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma and platelets overnight due to concern for tumor lysis syndrome. She was started on intravenous fluids with Lasix due to the concern for fluid overload.

The patient experienced a fever of 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit and showed signs of increased dyspnea, wheezing, and occasional cough. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39 degrees Celsius (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and has received aztreonam and vancomycin antibiotics. She is currently on multiple medications including furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The patient appears anxious and is sitting upright. Physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the bilateral lungs, tachycardia, and warm skin.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.1 K/uL, decreased platelet count"

   1. Respiratory failure, acute
   Likely due to pulmonary edema, suspect this is non-cardiogenic given
   preserved pump function on recent echo. Patient has received aggressive
   volume resuscitation since admission as well as numerous blood
   products. DDX broad consider transfusion reaction, leukostasis though
   WBC improved, pneumonia given fever, pulmonary hemorrhage given DIC. Sx
   started prior to receiving ATRA so can
t blame ATRA syndrome.
   Respiratory status improved yesterday following diuresis, but given
   concern for tumor lysis syndrome are limited in volume that can be
   removed. This AM, breathing is somewhat more labored. Suspect wheezing
   is fluid related.
   --Patient tolerated CPAP yesterday, would resume today. Follow
   respiratory status closely with repeat ABG this AM
   --Continue levo/aztreonam/vancomycin for broad coverage pending further
   cx data
   --Follow up cultures, reculture if febrile
   --CXR c/w fluid overload, but would pursue CT chest when stabilized to
   assess in more detail for evidence of pulmonary infection
   --Holding off on bronchoscopy, consider when patient intubated
   2. Elevated Cr
   Renal thinks NOT likely tumor lysis. Consider interstitial nephritis in
   setting of tumor lysis, but urine eosinophils negative. Would repeat
   urine electrolytes in setting of incr Cr. FeUrea ~53% using yesterday
   AM
s numbers but this was prior to more recent rise in Cr. Would spin
   urine for renal review. Nephrology recommendations appreciated. Discuss
   bicarbonate plans with both oncology and nephrology.
   3. APML with DIC
   Starting ATRA today per oncology. Monitor for signs of ATRA syndrome.
   Continue steroids per oncology. No evidence of significant gross
   bleeding at this time.
   --Follow CBC, DIC and tumor lysis labs q4 hours
   --Transfuse platelets>50, cryoglobulin for fibrinogen<100, goal INR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and has signs of pulmonary edema. This could be due to non-cardiogenic causes such as fluid overload or transfusion-related reactions. Other possible causes include pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.

2. Elevated Creatinine (Cr): The patient has an elevated creatinine level, which may indicate kidney dysfunction. While tumor lysis syndrome is a concern, the renal team does not believe this to be the cause. Interstitial nephritis is also a possibility, but urine eosinophils are negative. Further evaluation and discussion with nephrology are recommended.

3. Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has APML and is starting treatment with ATRA. Monitoring for signs of ATRA syndrome is important. The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a need for platelet transfusion. Additionally, cryoglobulin should be given for fibrinogen levels below 100, and the target INR should be around 1.5. Transfusion of packed red blood cells to maintain a hematocrit level above 25 is also necessary.

4. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient has a fever, and the source is uncertain. Given"

   1. Respiratory failure, acute
   Likely due to pulmonary edema, suspect this is non-cardiogenic given
   preserved pump function on recent echo. Patient has received aggressive
   volume resuscitation since admission as well as numerous blood
   products. DDX broad consider transfusion reaction, leukostasis though
   WBC improved, pneumonia given fever, pulmonary hemorrhage given DIC. Sx
   started prior to receiving ATRA so can
t blame ATRA syndrome.
   Respiratory status improved yesterday following diuresis, but given
   concern for tumor lysis syndrome are limited in volume that can be
   removed. This AM, breathing is somewhat more labored. Suspect wheezing
   is fluid related.
   --Patient tolerated CPAP yesterday, would resume today. Follow
   respiratory status closely with repeat ABG this AM
   --Continue levo/aztreonam/vancomycin for broad coverage pending further
   cx data
   --Follow up cultures, reculture if febrile
   --CXR c/w fluid overload, but would pursue CT chest when stabilized to
   assess in more detail for evidence of pulmonary infection
   --Holding off on bronchoscopy, consider when patient intubated
   2. Elevated Cr
   Renal thinks NOT likely tumor lysis. Consider interstitial nephritis in
   setting of tumor lysis, but urine eosinophils negative. Would repeat
   urine electrolytes in setting of incr Cr. FeUrea ~53% using yesterday
   AM
s numbers but this was prior to more recent rise in Cr. Would spin
   urine for renal review. Nephrology recommendations appreciated. Discuss
   bicarbonate plans with both oncology and nephrology.
   3. APML with DIC
   Starting ATRA today per oncology. Monitor for signs of ATRA syndrome.
   Continue steroids per oncology. No evidence of significant gross
   bleeding at this time.
   --Follow CBC, DIC and tumor lysis labs q4 hours
   --Transfuse platelets>50, cryoglobulin for fibrinogen<100, goal INR
   ~1.5. Transfuse Hct>25

   4. Febrile neutropenia
   Uncertain source at this time, though given SOB highest suspicion is
   for pulmonary etiology with workup as above. Also note that patient has

   toxin assay. Cultures pending, reculture if febrile continuing

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who presented to the ICU with shortness of breath (SOB). She has been receiving aggressive volume resuscitation, including blood products, and has shown signs of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory status improved after diuresis but worsened again, suggesting fluid-related wheezing. 

The patient's elevated creatinine levels are being monitored, and the possibility of interstitial nephritis is being considered. The patient will continue to receive allopurinol and IV fluids to maintain urine output. 

The patient has been diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and is starting all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy per oncology recommendations. 

She also has febrile neutropenia, with cultures pending, and her elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are being closely monitored for possible medication effect, disease-related causes, or infection. 

Overall, the patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, elevated creatinine levels, DIC, febrile neutropenia, and elevated LFTs."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with respiratory failure and acute renal failure, in the setting of a new diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has a history of penicillin allergy and is currently receiving treatment for leukemia. The patient's vital signs show fever, sinus tachycardia, and low blood pressure. She is receiving non-invasive ventilation and has been on BiPAP intermittently overnight. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, high lactate levels, and abnormalities in liver function tests. Fluid analysis shows fibrinogen levels of 140 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Differential diagnoses include TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury), infection, leukostasis, and other causes. The patient's mildly elevated central venous pressure (CVP) suggests possible decoupling of the right and left ventricles due to pre-existing pulmonary hypertension or leukostasis. CXR findings make pulmonary embolism (PE) less likely.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to a combination of hypoperfusion, microangiopathy, and tumor lysis. Her creatinine levels are rising significantly. Other possible causes include acute"

          Low threshold to intubate her, although she does not
   clinically require it at present: we will try to give her two hours on
   non-invasive mask ventilation, followed by one hour off.  We may be
   able to successfully do this for a couple of days, given how well she
   has tolerated it so far.

 rather, that she has capillary leak.  In this setting,
   her long-term survival is determined by her ability to receive adequate

   on her pulmonary function.  Therefore, I would favor being as

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with respiratory failure and acute renal failure in the setting of a new diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has a history of malignancy, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She is currently intubated and receiving non-invasive ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 129/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. Physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the chest, trace edema in the extremities, and no skin abnormalities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient has received multiple blood products and volume resuscitation due to low counts and risk of tumor lysis syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (TRALI), infection, leukostasis, or other causes. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory status are crucial, with a low threshold for intubation if necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female who was transferred from the floor to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She has a history of allergies to penicillins and has received antibiotics, including vancomycin and aztreonam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, blood pressure ranging from 152/83 to 102/59 mmHg, heart rate between 82-113 bpm, respiratory rate of 23-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on CPAP intermittently and has received a blood transfusion. She has a central venous pressure of 15 mmHg, and her fluid balance shows an intake of 5,953 mL and output of 2,495 mL since midnight. The patient's blood products include 1,772 mL of packed red blood cells and 40 mL of fresh frozen plasma. Her urine output is 2,495 mL, and she has received IV fluids totaling 3,841 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery and standby ventilator mode. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.32, with respiratory compensation. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the bilateral lungs, a distended abdomen, and positive fluid balance. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate a potential respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure, acute
   Likely due to pulmonary edema, suspect this is non-cardiogenic given
   preserved pump function on recent echo. Patient has received aggressive
   volume resuscitation since admission as well as numerous blood
   products. DDX broad consider transfusion reaction, leukostasis though
   WBC improved, pneumonia given fever, pulmonary hemorrhage given DIC. Sx
   started prior to receiving ATRA so can
t blame ATRA syndrome.
   Respiratory status improved yesterday following diuresis, but given
   concern for tumor lysis syndrome are limited in volume that can be
   removed. This AM, breathing is somewhat more labored. Suspect wheezing
   is fluid related.
   --Patient tolerated CPAP yesterday, would resume today. Follow
   respiratory status closely with repeat ABG this AM
   --Continue levo/aztreonam/vancomycin for broad coverage pending further
   cx data
   --Follow up cultures, reculture if febrile
   --CXR c/w fluid overload, but would pursue CT chest when stabilized to
   assess in more detail for evidence of pulmonary infection
   --Holding off on bronchoscopy, consider when patient intubated
   2. Elevated Cr
   Renal thinks NOT likely tumor lysis. Consider interstitial nephritis in
   setting of tumor lysis, but urine eosinophils negative. Would repeat
   urine electrolytes in setting of incr Cr. FeUrea ~53% using yesterday
   AM
s numbers but this was prior to more recent rise in Cr. Would spin
   urine for renal review. Nephrology recommendations appreciated. Discuss
   bicarbonate plans with both oncology and nephrology.
   3. APML with DIC
   Starting ATRA today per oncology. Monitor for signs of ATRA syndrome.
   Continue steroids per oncology. No evidence of significant gross
   bleeding at this time.
   --Follow CBC, DIC and tumor lysis labs q4 hours
   --Transfuse platelets>50, cryoglobulin for fibrinogen<100, goal INR
   ~1.5. Transfuse Hct>25
   --Continue allopurinol (reviewing dose with consultant teams) and
   continue IVF for now to maintain good urine output target 100cc/hr or
   per oncology recs
   --Management per oncology
   4. Febrile neutropenia
   Uncertain source at this time, though given SOB highest suspicion is
   for pulmonary etiology with workup as above. Also note that patient has
   PICC line. No GI symptoms suggestive of C. difficile colitis but f/u
   toxin assay. Cultures pending, reculture if febrile continuing
   antibiotics as above. Do not think she requires antifungal coverage at
   this time, glucan and galactomannan pending.
   5. Elevated LFTs
   Modestly improved today without specific intervention. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   medication effect (note that hydroxyurea can cause elevated
   transaminases), disease-related, or infection (e.g. viral etiology such
   as CMV or candidiasis). Hepatitis serologies unremarkable, recent
   negative liver ultrasound. Infectious workup as above, will follow
   daily LFTs for now. Holding statin in setting of elevated LFTs.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with respiratory distress.
- She was transferred from the floor to the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely caused by pulmonary edema.
- The patient has received aggressive volume resuscitation and numerous blood products.
- Her respiratory status improved yesterday but has worsened again today.
- The patient is currently on CPAP intermittently and will resume today.
- She has infections with fevers and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient has acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- She is starting treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) today and will be monitored for ATRA syndrome.
- The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and renal function is being closely monitored.
- Other issues include elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and a history of febrile neutropenia.

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure, acute
   CXR shows worsening pulmonary edema in setting of IVF and multiple
   blood products. Due to  worsening renal function yesterday had been
   hesistant to aggressively diurese. However Cr appears to have
   stabilized will aim for I/O goal even to net positive 500cc; will treat
   with lasix as needed with frequent I/O checks during the day. [**Month (only) 60**] also
   have had component of leukostasis, though WBC actually low at this
   point. Remain concerned for possible pulmonary infection. Would
   continue to attempt to obtain sputum sample, though yield likely low
   now that patient has been on antibiotics for some time. Continue
   current antibiotic coverage for now and reculture if febrile. Repeat
   vancomycin trough in AM. If intubated, would pursue bronchoscopy though
   patient unlikely stable enough at this time. Continue CPAP as needed, 2
   hours on/off at time.
   2. Elevated Cr
   Cr ~stabilized. Elevation may be [**1-16**] microvascular disease. Renal
   thinks less likely tumor lysis as serum uric acid and urine uric acid
   excretion not as elevated as expected for tumor lysis. Interstitial
   nephritis possible given antibiotics but urine eos negative. FeUrea
   ~55% arguing against pre-renal state. Producing adequate volumes of
   urine so think obstruction is less likely. Continue IVFs with
   bicarbonate for now. Repeat urinalysis, goal pH is 6.5-7. Renal
   recommendations appreciated.
   3. APML with DIC
   On day 2 ATRA, no evidence of ATRA syndrome currently. Continue
   steroids per oncology.
   She does have some hematuria currently. DIC remains a concern, though
   fibrinogen in normal range without recent need for replacement and INR
   decreased at 1.4.
   --Follow CBC, DIC and tumor lysis labs q4 hours
   --Transfuse platelets>50, cryoglobulin for fibrinogen<100, goal INR
   ~1.5. Transfuse Hct>25
   --Uric acid continues to increase, will continue allopurinol and IVF
   for now to maintain good urine output target 100cc/hr or per oncology
   recs
   --Management per oncology
   4. Febrile neutropenia
   Uncertain source at this time, though given SOB highest suspicion is
   for pulmonary etiology with workup as above. Also note that patient has
   PICC line. No GI symptoms suggestive of C. difficile colitis but f/u
   toxin assay. Cultures pending, reculture if febrile continuing
   antibiotics as above. Do not think she requires antifungal coverage at
   this time, glucan and galactomannan pending.
   5. Elevated LFTs
   Modestly improved today without specific intervention. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   medication effect (note that hydroxyurea can cause elevated
   transaminases), disease-related, or infection (e.g. viral etiology such
   as CMV or candidiasis). Hepatitis serologies unremarkable, recent
   negative liver ultrasound. Infectious workup as above, will follow
   daily LFTs for now. Holding statin in setting of elevated LFTs.

   Assessment and Plan
   60-year old woman with new diagnosis of APML complicated by
   leukostasis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   -          continue using non-invasive ventilation today:  try to do
   two hours on, then 30-60 minutes off
   -          low threshold to intubate, as reviewed in my note yesterday
   -          begin diuresis today, with a goal of even to negative 500
   -          continue treatment for possible (although somewhat unlikely)
   hospital-acquired pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -          this has stabilized
   -          although the uric acid has increased, her total WBC count
   has decreased substantially and so we may be getting past the window
   where tumor lysis is a major risk; this depends on what proportion of
   cells are marginated and unavailable in the preiphery.  Therefore, we
   will continue some fluids with bicarbonate but begin gentle diuresis
   today, as above
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)

","The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a new diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) complicated by leukostasis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She is currently in the ICU and receiving non-invasive ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may require intubation and mechanical ventilation if non-invasive ventilation is ineffective.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: Given her neutropenia, the patient is at an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered if suspected.
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): DIC is a known complication of acute leukemia and can lead to bleeding or clotting abnormalities. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management is essential.
4. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to multifactorial causes such as chemotherapy, sepsis, or hepatic involvement by leukemia. Close monitoring of liver function tests is necessary.
5. Neutropenia: The patient's low white blood cell count increases her risk of infections. Strict infection control measures and prompt treatment of any suspected infections are crucial.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and close monitoring of kidney function and fluid balance is necessary. Diuretics may be used to manage fluid overload.

   Assessment and Plan
   60-year old woman with new diagnosis of APML complicated by
   leukostasis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   -          continue using non-invasive ventilation today:  try to do
   two hours on, then 30-60 minutes off
   -          low threshold to intubate, as reviewed in my note yesterday
   -          begin diuresis today, with a goal of even to negative 500
   -          continue treatment for possible (although somewhat unlikely)
   hospital-acquired pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -          this has stabilized
   -          although the uric acid has increased, her total WBC count
   has decreased substantially and so we may be getting past the window
   where tumor lysis is a major risk; this depends on what proportion of
   cells are marginated and unavailable in the preiphery.  Therefore, we
   will continue some fluids with bicarbonate but begin gentle diuresis
   today, as above
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   -          ATRA and idarubicin per oncology
   -
 DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION (DIC)

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure, acute
   CXR shows worsening pulmonary edema in setting of IVF and multiple
   blood products. Due to  worsening renal function yesterday had been
   hesistant to aggressively diurese. However Cr appears to have
   stabilized will aim for I/O goal even to net positive 500cc; will treat
   with lasix as needed with frequent I/O checks during the day. [**Month (only) 60**] also
   have had component of leukostasis, though WBC actually low at this
   point. Remain concerned for possible pulmonary infection. Would
   continue to attempt to obtain sputum sample, though yield likely low
   now that patient has been on antibiotics for some time. Continue
   current antibiotic coverage for now and reculture if febrile. Repeat
   vancomycin trough in AM. If intubated, would pursue bronchoscopy though
   patient unlikely stable enough at this time. Continue CPAP as needed, 2
   hours on/off at time.
   2. Elevated Cr
   Cr ~stabilized. Elevation may be [**1-16**] microvascular disease. Renal
   thinks less likely tumor lysis as serum uric acid and urine uric acid
   excretion not as elevated as expected for tumor lysis. Interstitial
   nephritis possible given antibiotics but urine eos negative. FeUrea
   ~55% arguing against pre-renal state. Producing adequate volumes of
   urine so think obstruction is less likely. Continue IVFs with
   bicarbonate for now. Repeat urinalysis, goal pH is 6.5-7. Renal
   recommendations appreciated.
   3. APML with DIC
   On day 2 ATRA, no evidence of ATRA syndrome currently. Continue
   steroids per oncology.
   She does have some hematuria currently. DIC remains a concern, though
   fibrinogen in normal range without recent need for replacement and INR
   decreased at 1.4.
   --Follow CBC, DIC and tumor lysis labs q4 hours
   --Transfuse platelets>50, cryoglobulin for fibrinogen<100, goal INR
   ~1.5. Transfuse Hct>25
   --Uric acid continues to increase, will continue allopurinol and IVF
   for now to maintain good urine output target 100cc/hr or per oncology
   recs
   --Management per oncology
   4. Febrile neutropenia
   Uncertain source at this time, though given SOB highest suspicion is
   for pulmonary etiology with workup as above. Also note that patient has
   PICC line. No GI symptoms suggestive of C. difficile colitis but f/u
   toxin assay. Cultures pending, reculture if febrile continuing
   antibiotics as above. Do not think she requires antifungal coverage at
   this time, glucan and galactomannan pending.
   5. Elevated LFTs
   Modestly improved today without specific intervention. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   medication effect (note that hydroxyurea can cause elevated
   transaminases), disease-related, or infection (e.g. viral etiology such
   as CMV or candidiasis). Hepatitis serologies unremarkable, recent
   negative liver ultrasound. Infectious workup as above, will follow
   daily LFTs for now. Holding statin in setting of elevated LFTs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a new diagnosis of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) and is currently in the ICU. She has received a transfusion of red blood cells with an appropriate response. Intermittent CPAP through the day, lasix given to achieve even input/output balance. The patient has allergies to penicillins and has been receiving vancomycin and aztreonam as antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 144/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on CPAP mode with a tidal volume of 420 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 33 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 22.5 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of -1.6 mEq/L. Her white blood cell (WBC) count is low at 4.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) is 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) is 21 K/uL. Her creatinine (Cr) level is stable at 1.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 60 mg/dL, and glucose is 142 mg/dL. Her calcium (Ca++) level is 6.9 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level is 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) level is 4.7 mg/dL. The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to worsening pulmonary edema, elevated creatinine, acute promyelocytic leukemia with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), febrile neutropenia, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). She requires close monitoring and management of her condition, including frequent input/output checks, continuing current antibiotic coverage, repeat vancomycin trough in AM, and consideration for bronchoscopy if intubated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening pulmonary edema and respiratory distress may lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Elevated creatinine: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which can progress to renal failure if not addressed promptly.
3. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) with DIC: The patient's diagnosis of APML increases the risk of DIC, which can lead to bleeding and clotting complications if not managed effectively.
4. Febrile neutropenia: The patient's low WBC count and fever increase the risk of infections, and prompt identification and treatment of the source of infection are crucial to prevent complications.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated liver function tests may indicate liver involvement by the underlying disease, medication effects, or infection. Close monitoring and further investigation are necessary to determine the cause and prevent potential liver damage."

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure, acute
   Dyspnea on floor likely due to volume overload in setting of blood
   products and IVF, perhaps with contribution from leukostasis or
   pulmonary infection. Currently maintaining good oxygen saturations with
   decreased O2 requirements. Has not required CPAP since last evening.
   CXR and exam show persistent pulmonary edema. Cr beginning to trend
   down therefore feel comfortable with further diuresis today. Goal net
   negative 1-2 liters. Continue antibiotics for now as patient was
   febrile in setting of her respiratory distress. Still have been unable
   to obtain sputum culture. In setting of neutropenia, reluctant to
   discontinue her antibiotics as she has clinically improved on them.
   Vancomycin trough remains elevated this morning, would redose for
   trough<20.
   2. Elevated Cr
   Cr trending back down, urine output good. Uric acid relatively stable.
   Holding IVF for now in setting of diuresis, would resume if needed to
   maintain good urine flow (target 100cc/hr or per oncology).
   3. APML with DIC
   On day 3 ATRA, no evidence of ATRA syndrome currently. Continue
   steroids per oncology.
   Has some persistent hematuria, but improved today.
   --Follow CBC, DIC and tumor lysis labs q4 hours
   --Transfuse platelets>50, cryoglobulin for fibrinogen<100, goal INR
   ~1.5. Transfuse Hct>25
   --Consider increasing uric acid dosing to 300mg daily
   --Management per oncology
   4. Febrile neutropenia
   Currently afebrile, hemodynamically stable.
   Uncertain source at this time, though given SOB highest suspicion is
   for pulmonary etiology with workup as above. Also note that patient has
   PICC line. No GI symptoms suggestive of C. difficile colitis but f/u
   toxin assay. Cultures pending, reculture if febrile continuing
   antibiotics as above. Do not think she requires antifungal coverage at
   this time, fungal markers negative (consider repeat galactomannan to
   see whether trending up)
   5. Elevated LFTs
   Improved today. [**Month (only) 60**] be medication effect (note that hydroxyurea can
   cause elevated transaminases), disease-related, or infection (e.g.
   viral etiology such as CMV or candidiasis). Hepatitis serologies
   unremarkable, recent negative liver ultrasound. Infectious workup as
   above, will follow daily LFTs for now. Holding statin in setting of
   elevated LFTs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a new diagnosis of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) and is currently admitted to the ICU. She has been receiving intermittent CPAP, transfused with red blood cells and platelets, and is on multiple medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and chemotherapy. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 144/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula with CPAP. She is also on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 420 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and liver function tests (LFTs). She has been febrile and requires antibiotics. The patient's review of systems is positive for cough and crackles in the lungs, but no chest pain or dyspnea. She is comfortable and not in acute distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's dyspnea on the floor likely due to volume overload, leukostasis, or pulmonary infection, as well as persistent pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, indicates a risk of respiratory failure. Currently maintaining"

","The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has been on noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) as planned and has shown improvement, reporting being more comfortable. The patient has received Lasix and blood product transfusions, which seem to have decreased. She has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 141/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 19 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

Laboratory results show leukocytopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.2 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 66 K/uL, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL. Renal function tests indicate acute kidney injury with elevated serum creatinine levels. Liver function tests reveal elevated liver enzymes, but overall liver function appears to be improving.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, possibly not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is currently in the ICU. She has respiratory failure, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and liver function abnormalities. The patient's condition appears to be improving, as she reports being more comfortable and has decreased blood product requirements. She has been receiving Lasix, amitriptyline, allopurinol, metoprolol, levothyroxine, H2 blockers, steroids, levofloxacin, and other medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 141/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) as planned. Her blood counts are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated white blood cell count. Her coagulation parameters are abnormal, indicating DIC. Imaging and microbiology results are pending. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she is on NIMV. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not adequately supported.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has decreased urine output, and her"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure, acute
   Dyspnea on floor likely due to volume overload in setting of blood
   products and IVF, perhaps with contribution from leukostasis or
   pulmonary infection. Currently maintaining good oxygen saturations with
   decreased O2 requirements. Has not required CPAP recently. CXR and exam
   show persistent pulmonary edema. Cr stabilized therefore feel
   comfortable with further diuresis today. Goal net negative 1-2 liters.
   Continue antibiotics for now as patient was febrile in setting of her
   respiratory distress. Still have been unable to obtain sputum culture.
   In setting of neutropenia, reluctant to discontinue her antibiotics as
   she has clinically improved on them. Vancomycin trough remains elevated
   this morning, would redose for trough<20.
   2. Elevated Cr
   Cr trending back down, urine output good. Uric acid relatively stable.
   Holding IVF for now in setting of diuresis, would resume if needed to
   maintain good urine flow (target 100cc/hr or per oncology).
   3. APML with DIC

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a newly diagnosed condition who has been transferred to the ICU due to increased respiratory distress. She has been placed on a PICC line and has received antibiotics for febrile neutropenia, which she is currently responding to. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 139/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 632 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating diuresis. Her laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but her creatinine has stabilized. The fibrinogen level is borderline low, suggesting a possible low level of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, leukostasis, or pulmonary infection. She is currently maintaining good oxygen saturations without the need for CPAP. The chest X-ray shows persistent pulmonary edema, and the goal is to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters. 

The patient also has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to medication effect, disease-related causes, or infection. Hepatitis serologies are unremarkable, and infectious workup is pending. 

Overall, the patient is stable in the ICU"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure, acute
   Dyspnea on floor likely due to volume overload in setting of blood
   products and IVF, perhaps with contribution from leukostasis or
   pulmonary infection. Currently maintaining good oxygen saturations with
   decreased O2 requirements. Has not required CPAP recently. CXR and exam
   show persistent pulmonary edema. Cr stabilized therefore feel
   comfortable with further diuresis today. Goal net negative 1-2 liters.
   Continue antibiotics for now as patient was febrile in setting of her
   respiratory distress. Still have been unable to obtain sputum culture.
   In setting of neutropenia, reluctant to discontinue her antibiotics as
   she has clinically improved on them. F/u vancomycin trough this AM,
   goal trough 15-20.
   2. Elevated Cr
   Cr trending back down, urine output good. Uric acid relatively stable.
   Holding IVF for now in setting of diuresis, would resume if needed to
   maintain good urine flow (target 100cc/hr or per oncology).
   3. APML with DIC
   On day 3 ATRA, no evidence of ATRA syndrome currently. Continue
   steroids per oncology.
   Has some persistent hematuria, but improved today.
   Fibrinogen borderline
 may have low level DIC
   --Follow CBC, DIC and tumor lysis labs q4 hours
   --Transfuse platelets>50, cryoglobulin for fibrinogen<100, goal INR
   ~1.5. Transfuse Hct>25
   --Consider increasing uric acid dosing to 300mg daily
   --Management per oncology
   4. Febrile neutropenia
   Currently afebrile, hemodynamically stable.
   Uncertain source at this time, though given SOB highest suspicion is
   for pulmonary etiology with workup as above. Also note that patient has
   PICC line. No GI symptoms suggestive of C. difficile colitis but f/u
   toxin assay. Cultures pending, reculture if febrile continuing
   antibiotics as above. Do not think she requires antifungal coverage at
   this time, fungal markers negative (consider repeat galactomannan to
   see whether trending up)
   5. Elevated LFTs
   Improved today. [**Month (only) 60**] be medication effect (note that hydroxyurea can
   cause elevated transaminases), disease-related, or infection (e.g.
   viral etiology such as CMV or candidiasis). Hepatitis serologies
   unremarkable, recent negative liver ultrasound. Infectious workup as
   above, will follow daily LFTs for now. Holding statin in setting of
   elevated LFTs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a newly diagnosed condition, admitted to the ICU due to increased respiratory distress. She has been placed on a PICC line and is currently maintaining good oxygen saturation with a nasal cannula. The patient's allergies include penicillins, and she has received antibiotics (Vancomycin and Aztreonam) as per the medical team's assessment.

The patient's vital signs show stable temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure levels. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation remains at 98%. The patient's current weight is 68.6 kg, with a height of 63 inches. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 20 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid balance.

The patient's fluid intake and output balance shows a total input of 3,893 mL and total output of 4,525 mL since midnight, with urine output of 4,525 mL. Her weight gain is 1.6 kg since admission. The patient is receiving medications such as Furosemide (Lasix) and other ICU medications as per the treatment plan.

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure, acute
   Dyspnea on floor likely due to volume overload in setting of blood
   products and IVF, perhaps with contribution from leukostasis or
   pulmonary infection. Currently maintaining good oxygen saturations with
   decreased O2 requirements. Has not required CPAP >24 hours. CXR and
   exam show persistent pulmonary edema. Cr stabilized therefore feel
   comfortable with further diuresis today. Goal net negative 1-2 liters.
   Continue antibiotics for now as patient was febrile in setting of her
   respiratory distress, and is now neutropenic. Treating presumed
   pulmonary source, though patient has been unable to produce sputum
   sample. Respiratory virus screen negative. F/u vancomycin trough this
   AM, goal trough 15-20.
   2. Elevated Cr
   Cr stable though above baseline with good urine output. Renal thinks
   not tumor lysis given only moderately elevated uric acid and urine uric
   acid/cr ratio. Uric acid ~stable in mid 8
   Starting sevelemer for elevated phosphorus
   Holding IVF for now in setting of diuresis, would resume if needed to
   maintain good urine flow (target 100cc/hr or per oncology).
   3. APML with DIC
   On day 4 ATRA, no evidence of ATRA syndrome currently. Continue
   steroids per oncology.
   Fibrinogen borderline
 may have low level DIC
   --Follow CBC, DIC and tumor lysis labs q4 hours
   --Transfuse platelets>50, cryoglobulin for fibrinogen<100, goal INR
   ~1.5. Transfuse Hct>25
   --Continue allopurinol
   --Management per oncology
   4. Febrile neutropenia
   Currently afebrile, hemodynamically stable.
   Uncertain source at this time, though given SOB highest suspicion is
   for pulmonary etiology with workup as above. Also note that patient has
   PICC line. No GI symptoms suggestive of C. difficile colitis but f/u
   toxin assay. Cultures pending, reculture if febrile continuing
   antibiotics as above. Do not think she requires antifungal coverage at
   this time, fungal markers negative (consider repeat galactomannan to
   see whether trending up)
   5. Elevated LFTs
   Decreased recently, repeat today. [**Month (only) 60**] be medication related
   (?hydroxyurea. Hepatitis serologies unremarkable, recent negative liver
   ultrasound. Holding statin in setting of elevated LFTs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a newly diagnosed condition who was transferred to the ICU due to increased respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications. She has shown improvement in her oxygen saturation levels but still has pulmonary edema. The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels are stable, and her urine output is good. She has a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), febrile neutropenia, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is currently afebrile and hemodynamically stable, but her source of infection is uncertain. She has been prescribed various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and supportive care. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and her progress will be followed through frequent laboratory tests and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of dyspnea and the presence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Continued monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory effort is essential.
2. Volume overload: The patient's history of receiving blood products and intravenous fluids (IVF) suggests the possibility of volume overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance and adjusting diuretic therapy may be necessary.
3. Pulmonary infection: The patient's respiratory distress, fever, and neutropenia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with an admission diagnosis of respiratory distress and a high white blood cell count. She was transferred from the floor to the ICU and has been receiving BiPAP support. The patient is expected to be transferred back to the floor soon. 

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, which was stopped after 8 hours and 29 minutes. The patient has allergies to penicillins and has received antibiotics such as vancomycin and aztreonam. She is currently receiving infusions of furosemide and other ICU medications.

Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory distress.

Her physical examination shows that she is well-nourished and has symmetric chest expansion with crackles in both lungs. She has trace edema in both lower extremities and warm skin. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately.

Laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Her creatinine level is stable, and she has good urine output. Her liver function tests are mildly elevated but resolving. She has acute renal failure, resolved respiratory failure,"
