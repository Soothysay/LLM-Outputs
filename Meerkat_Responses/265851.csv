   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved after receiving IV labetalol. Had HA
   and SBP>200 but resolved. Floor team was having difficulty achieving
   control (systolic > 210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg
   daily, and amlodipine 10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO
   q6H with PRN 10mg IV. They also tried enalaprilat with no effect.
   However, upon transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further
   expansion of antihypertensive regimen. Possibly was hypertensive from
   constipation and abdominal pain which is now improved.  CT and MRI
   showed no sign of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Will discontinue labetalol drip today given improvement to SBP down
   to 130
s to 150
s, goal should be around 150 systolic
   - Will restart oral regimen of Valsartan 80mg daily,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg
   QD
   - Will make hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for elevated
   pressures
   - F/U formal read of MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 yesterday
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation improved. CXR was clear on admission and on [**11-30**] so may
   have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing well.
   Completed azithromycin course, on day 5 of ceftriaxone, last day
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia vs.
   gastritis.
   - Continue bowel regimen as this is likely related to constipation, if
   worsens consider KUB to rule out obstruction
   - Continue pantoprazole
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, continue to renally dose
   meds, continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with
   increased dose valsartan.
   - at baseline. will follow
   # Anemia: Stable recently, iron deficiency?  Continue iron
   supplementation
   - continue to trend

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of mesenteric ischemia and transient ischemic attack (TIA) who presented to the MICU with a hypertensive emergency that has now been resolved. She was started on IV labetalol and her blood pressure has been better controlled, ranging from 150 systolic to 130. The patient continues to experience intermittent epigastric pain but it is not currently associated with nausea. The pain resolved yesterday with a bowel movement. 

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. She was previously on antibiotics (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) but is currently not on any active antibiotic therapy. 

The patient is currently receiving multiple infusions and medications in the ICU, including labetalol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and others. Her past medical history includes hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency), pneumonia (bacterial, community-acquired), and abdominal pain (including abdominal tenderness). 

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/41 mmHg to 125/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved. Had HA and SBP>200 but these now
   resolved. Floor team having difficulty achieving control (systolic >
   210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg daily, and amlodipine
   10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO q6H with PRN 10mg IV.
   They have also tried enalaprilat with no effect. However, upon
   transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further expansion of
   antihypertensive regimen. Unclear when BP improved but has not required
   labetalol drip. Possibly was hypertensive from constipation and
   abdominal pain which is now improved. Stroke was also concern but would
   not expect spontaneous improvement
   - Furosemide 40mg IV and hydral IV prn
   - Continue Valsartan 80mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO,
   metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine
   - PRN hydralazine and will start labetalol drip if neccessary to
   maintain SBP<180
   - F/U read MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 today
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation marginally improved. CXR was clear on admission and on
   [**11-30**] so may have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing
   well on CTX/Azithro.
   - Continue empiric CAP coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
   10-day course. Sputum cx grew moraxella which would be covered by
   current regimen.  Azithromycin to finish on [**12-5**], ceftriaxone on
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia.
   Amylase and lipase reviously normal but can recheck in am
   - Continue to monitor, repeat lactate if needed
   - repeat amylase and lipase
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, renally dose meds,
   continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with increased

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of mesenteric ischemia and transient ischemic attack (TIA) admitted to the MICU with hypertensive emergency, now resolved. He was transferred from the floor due to uncontrolled blood pressure despite multiple medications. His blood pressure is currently stable in the 150s without the need for further expansion of the antihypertensive regimen. The patient's acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure has improved with the administration of furosemide. He also has pneumonia, with marginal improvement in oxygenation. The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, and chronic renal failure are stable. His anemia is also stable but increasing. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and presented with a hypertensive emergency. Although his blood pressure is currently stable, there is still a risk of potential complications related to high blood pressure, such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.
2. Congestive heart failure: The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure is acute on chronic and has improved with the administration of furosemide. However, there is still a risk of worsening heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath and fluid retention.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, such as cough and difficulty breathing. There is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/28 mmHg to 204/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool delivery device.
- The patient has a history of pneumonia, abdominal pain, hypertension, and is currently in the ICU.
- Physical examination findings include crackles in the bibasilar region of the chest, tenderness in the epigastric area, absent pulses in both radial arteries, present pulses in both distal phalanges, and minimal tenderness in the epigastric region.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit, creatinine, and potassium levels.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.
- The patient has a systolic murmur on cardiovascular examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia and physical examination findings of crackles in the bibasilar region suggest a potential complication related to their respiratory system.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness, along with the elevated amylase and lipase levels, may indicate potential complications in the gastrointestinal system."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved after receiving IV labetalol. Had HA
   and SBP>200 but resolved. Floor team was having difficulty achieving
   control (systolic > 210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg
   daily, and amlodipine 10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO
   q6H with PRN 10mg IV. They also tried enalaprilat with no effect.
   However, upon transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further
   expansion of antihypertensive regimen. Possibly was hypertensive from
   constipation and abdominal pain which is now improved.  CT and MRI
   showed no sign of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Will discontinue labetalol drip today given improvement to SBP down
   to 130
s to 150
s, goal should be around 150 systolic
   - Will restart oral regimen of Valsartan 80mg daily,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg
   QD
   - Will make hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for elevated
   pressures
   - F/U formal read of MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 yesterday
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation improved. CXR was clear on admission and on [**11-30**] so may
   have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing well.
   Completed azithromycin course, on day 5 of ceftriaxone, last day
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia vs.
   gastritis.
   - Continue bowel regimen as this is likely related to constipation, if
   worsens consider KUB to rule out obstruction
   - Continue pantoprazole
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, continue to renally dose
   meds, continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with
   increased dose valsartan.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of mesenteric ischemia, TIA, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. She was admitted to the ICU with a hypertensive emergency, which has now resolved. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/28 mmHg to 204/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on various medications including labetalol, valsartan, metoprolol, amlodipine, hydralazine, furosemide, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, benzonatate, codeine, pantoprazole, and iron supplementation. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient had a hypertensive emergency but has since stabilized. However, there is still a need for close monitoring of blood pressure levels to prevent any potential complications associated with high blood pressure.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of community-acquired pneumonia and is currently being treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Close monitoring for any worsening of symptoms or signs of infection is necessary.

   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and
   hyponatremia transferred to MICU with with hypertensive urgency now
   resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency: BP improved some after labetalol drip and
   receiving hydralazine PO PRN.  CT and MRI showed no sign of ischemic or
   hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Continue Valsartan 80mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO,
   metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg QD
   - Will continue hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for
   elevated pressures or long acting nitrates if continues to be very
   elevated
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray.  Saturations
   range in 90
s on 2L NC now, but comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 on admission to the MICU, have not
   repeated
   # Pneumonia - Pt has been afebrile.  She had an infiltrate on CXR and
   Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have mildly productive cough.
   Oxygenation stable.  Completed azithromycin course, on day 6 of
   ceftriaxone, last day [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia vs.
   gastritis.
   - Continue bowel regimen as this is likely related to constipation, if
   worsens consider KUB to rule out obstruction
   - Continue pantoprazole
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, continue to renally dose
   meds, continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with
   increased dose valsartan.
   - at baseline. will follow
   # Anemia: Stable recently, iron deficiency?  Continue iron
   supplementation, may be contributing to the constipation.
   - continue to trend
   - guaiac stools
   # TIA history:  No mental status changes.  CT negative for acute
   process.  Continue aggrenox and simvastatin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of mesenteric ischemia and transient ischemic attack (TIA) admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypertensive urgency. The patient's blood pressure has improved after receiving labetalol drip and oral hydralazine. Imaging studies showed no signs of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.

The patient has several ongoing medical conditions, including acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, pneumonia, abdominal pain, chronic renal failure, anemia, and a history of TIA.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypertensive urgency: Continue Valsartan 80mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [Hospital1], and amlodipine 10mg QD. Consider nitropaste or long-acting nitrates for elevated pressures.
2. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 on admission to MICU. Repeat if necessary.
3. Pneumonia: Completed azithromycin course, on day 6 of ceftriaxone. Continue benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough. Consult physical therapy for chest physical therapy.
