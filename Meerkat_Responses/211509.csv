","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual without acute distress. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/72 to 176/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on sinus tachycardia and receives no respiratory support. Fluid balance shows an intake of 300 mL and output of 0 mL. There is no mention of any new complaints overnight. The patient has a history of rash with cephalexin. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Physical examination reveals normal findings except for absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to movement and tone not being evaluated. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Absent peripheral pulses: The absence of peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities indicates a potential circulatory problem. This could be due to vascular injury, thrombosis, or other vascular abnormalities. Further investigation and intervention are necessary to determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment.

2. History of rash with cephalexin: The patient has a known allergy to cephalexin, which is an oral antibiotic. It is crucial to avoid administering this medication to prevent an allergic reaction"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hypertension (HTN), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) presenting for elective administration of abatacept infusion. The patient has a history of anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept. Vital signs are within normal limits, and the patient is currently receiving ICU care. The patient is on steroids, abatacept, and prophylactic medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anaphylactic reaction to abatacept infusion due to previous anaphylactoid reaction.
2. Hypersensitivity reaction to prednisone or other medications.
3. Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to DM2 management.
4. Uncontrolled HTN.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to IBD or stress ulcer prophylaxis failure.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypercoagulable state.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
8. Infection or sepsis due to immunosuppressive therapy.
9. Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance due to inappropriate fluid management.
10. Pressure injury or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility."

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a medical history of psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He has had an anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept in the past. The patient presents for elective administration of monitored abatacept. He is currently being premedicated with higher-dose prednisone. The pharmacy is working on obtaining the necessary amount of abatacept.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abatacept reaction: Due to the patient's previous anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept, there is a risk of a similar or more severe allergic reaction occurring during or after the administration of abatacept.
2. Psoriatic arthritis: The patient's psoriatic arthritis may not respond to abatacept as expected, or there could be an exacerbation of symptoms.
3. IBD: There is a possibility of an active flare-up of the patient's IBD despite currently being inactive.
4. DM2: The patient's blood glucose levels may become unstable due to the hold on PO hypoglycemics and the initiation of insulin subcutaneous injections (ISS).
5. HTN: If the patient experiences an anaphylactic reaction, it may lead to elevated blood pressure.
6. Lines: There is a potential risk of infection associated with the presence of an indwelling line.

   #. Abatacept reaction: Had anaphylactoid reaction in the past.
   Premedicated with famotidine, benadryl and solumedrol.  Pt was started
   on higher dose prednisone.  Received abatacept yesterday at 3pm.  Had
   mild allergic reaction type symptoms however no obvious signs of
   anaphylaxis
   -          Monitor for 24 hours after initial infusion
   -          Continue higher dose prednisone
   -          Continue famotidine and benadryl for 24 hours post infusion
   -          Discuss with allergy/attending whether he can still d/c home
   this afternoon or whether, given the hand swelling, he will need to
   stay another day for further monitoring.
   #. Psoriatic arthritis: Receiving steroids and abatacept
   #. IBD: Currently inactive, on flagyl ppx

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   His right hand continues to swell. There is no swelling elsewhere
   including oropharynx and airway. He denies respiratory symptoms and his
   lungs are clear. He will be continued on prednisone, benadryl, H2
   blocker, singulair. He will be observed overnight in the hospital.

He has had a previous anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept, which is a medication used to treat psoriatic arthritis. The patient was admitted electively for monitored administration of abatacept.

The patient received the medication yesterday at 3 pm and experienced mild allergic reaction symptoms, including hand swelling. He was premedicated with famotidine, benadryl, and solumedrol. His symptoms resolved after treatment with atrovent neb treatment.

Currently, the patient is stable and resting comfortably in bed. His vital signs are within normal range, and he has good oxygenation. There are no signs of acute distress or abnormal findings on physical examination.

The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating an intake of 441 mL and output of 50 mL over the past 24 hours. He is receiving IV fluids, and his urine output is normal.

The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery via none, with SpO2 levels at 97%. His ABG results are pending.

The patient's past medical history includes allergies to cephalexin, which caused a rash, and a previous anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept. He is currently on higher dose prednisone, famotidine, and benadryl.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and a history of anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept. The patient presented for elective administration of abatacept under close monitoring. He was premedicated with famotidine, benadryl, and solumedrol. The patient received abatacept yesterday at 3 pm and experienced mild allergic reaction symptoms but no signs of anaphylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Abatacept reaction: The patient has a history of anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept. There is a possibility of another allergic reaction or anaphylaxis during further administration of abatacept.
2. Psoriatic arthritis: The patient is receiving steroids and abatacept for his psoriatic arthritis. He may experience side effects from these medications, such as increased risk of infection or gastrointestinal disturbances.
3. IBD: The patient's IBD is currently inactive, but he is on Flagyl prophylaxis. There is a risk of Clostridium difficile infection due to antibiotic use.
4. DM2: The patient's oral hypoglycemic medications have been held, and he will start insulin subcutaneous short-acting (ISS). There is a risk of hyperglycemia without proper glycemic control.
