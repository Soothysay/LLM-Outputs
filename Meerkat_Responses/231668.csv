   Assessment and Plan
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Patient is a 32M with idiopathic dilated CM (EF 20%), afib, CVA, SDH,
   and hypothyroidism who is admitted for diuresis and milrinone.
   .
   # PUMP: CHF/Dilated Cardiomyopathy: TTE [**8-3**] showed EF 20%, diagnosed
   after presenting with Class III CHF symptoms in [**9-27**], thought to be
   viral etiology, s/p AICD. His dry weight is 100 kg, currently below dry
   weight at 93kg. Had recent admission at OSH where he presented with LE
   swelling and received IV lasix.  Currently does not appear volume
   overloaded, JVP flat, lungs clear and only trace edema. Plan as
   outlined by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]:
   - continue metoprolol 200mg tid to suppress arrythmogenic effects of
   milrinone
   - continue milrinone infusion at .5 mcg/kg/min, can titrate up to
   0.75mcg/kg/min.
   - Start to wean off milrinone late tonight
   - Maintain SBP>80, MAP>40
   - continue digoxin
   - continue lasix gtt, titrate to net negative ~1L daily, inc. to 10
   today
   - continue fluid restriction
   - continue low-dose ACEI
   .
   # RHYTHM: Chronic atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, diagnosed in the
   setting of hyperthyroidism. Coumadin held [**Date range (1) 2788**] s/p SDH.
   Initially held this hospitalization for INR 3.5.  INR today 2.9
   - restart lower dose coumadin
   - uptitrate metoprolol as above
   .
   # h/o Ventricular Tachycardia: first noted in [**9-27**], had non sustained
   30 second run seen on Holter [**8-29**], s/p syncope from VT in [**9-1**].
   - monitor on telemetry
   - ICD in place
   - maintain K >4, Mg >2
   .
   # NEURO: s/p CVA as well as SDH. On Keppra for sz prophylaxis.
   Admitted to OSH in [**9-2**] after seizure at home and he was started on
   Keppra. Has been seizure free.
   - Cont Keppra 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Thyroid dysfunction: Originally had hyperthyroidism, secondary to
   Amiodarone (d/ced [**3-1**]), s/p prednisone and methimazole-->
   hypothyroidism
   -continue synthroid
   .
   # CRI: Baseline Cr 1.7-1.8.  Likely related to poor forward flow. Cr
   down to below baseline today at 1.5 with diuresis.
   - Cont to follow with diuresis
   - renally dose meds

   Currently at baseline, no signs of bleeding

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), subdural hematoma (SDH), and hypothyroidism. He was admitted for diuresis and milrinone infusion.

The patient has been diagnosed with heart failure (CHF) due to his dilated cardiomyopathy. He presented with Class III CHF symptoms and was found to have an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient also has chronic atrial fibrillation, which was initially diagnosed during an episode of hyperthyroidism. His International Normalized Ratio (INR) is currently at 2.9, and he will be restarted on a lower dose of Coumadin.

The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, for which an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been placed. He is currently on metoprolol to suppress arrhythmogenic effects of milrinone and will continue to be monitored on telemetry.

The patient also has a history of CVA and SDH. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a seizure at home and started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. He has been seizure-free since then.

The patient's thyroid function was originally hyperthyroidism secondary to Amiodarone, and he was treated with pred"
