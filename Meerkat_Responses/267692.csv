   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including COPD, CAD, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, anemia, depression, anxiety, osteoarthritis, chronic diarrhea, chronic heart failure, and a history of subdural hemorrhage. The patient presented to the hospital with altered mental status and was found to have pneumonia, hypernatremia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient also has a history of falls, and the most recent fall resulted in a subdural hemorrhage. The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are some fluctuations in blood pressure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated troponin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas reveals a slightly alkalotic pH with normal oxygen levels. The patient's physical examination shows warm extremities, pitting edema in the right hand, numerous bruises, no rash, and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities, along with apparent paralysis of the right leg with upgoing toe. The patient's neurologic examination reveals that he responds to voice commands, withdraws from pain, and has increased tone in the left extremities. The patient's past medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: [**Age over 90 52**]yo F with DMII, PVD, COPD, frequent UTIs p/w hypotension, fever
   and altered mental status found to have GNR [**Hospital 83**] transferred to ICU for
   PEA arrest on the floor, resuscitated and intubated.
   #Cardiac Arrest
most likely [**3-6**] aspiration event resulting in vagal
   stimulus and hypotension/bradycardia.  In addition gastric contents
   were suctioned from her ETT immediately following intubation.  Other
   possible causes include sepsis vs. hypoxia vs. MI vs pulmonary
   embolism.  She was resuscitated on the floor with atropine,
   epinephrine, IVF's, chest compressions and intubation.
   -continue with IVF boluses
   -intubated to maintain airway/prevent aspiration
   -cardiac enzymes -> not consistant with ACS as cause of PEA arrest
   given relatively minor elevation in CE
s which is more likely the
   result of cardiac arrest and resuscitation than the cause.
   -ekg
   -LENI's to evaluate risk of PE
   -continue with suctioning prn
   #Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome- diffuse alveolar infiltrates and
   P:F <200 (ABG on 100%FIO2 7.39/40/151)  c/w ARDS likely [**3-6**]
   aspiration.  Other potential causes of respiratory failure and
   bilateral infiltrates is DAH vs pneumonia vs. CHF exacerbation.  Also
   with bright red blood suctioned from ET tube on intubation ?trauma vs
   DAH.  She has had minimal blood per ETT since initial intubation.
   -continue with broad coverage antibiotics with vanc and cefepime (f/u
   sensitivities of GNR's on urine cx)
   -add flagyl for anaerobic coverage given high risk of aspiration
   -wean FIO2 for PaO2 >60
   -target TV of [**7-11**] cc/kg IBW; changed to pressure support on AM rounds,
   continue as tolerated
   -did not tolerate SBT this am, attempt again tomorrow morning
   #Hypotension
 most likely cause is systemic inflammatory response [**3-6**]
   pneumonitis/pneumonia.  [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim not c/w adrenal insufficiency.  She
   did not require pressors.
   -treat with abx as above
   -IVF's as needed to keep SBP 140
s given likely high resistance of
   renal arteries [**3-6**] PVD
   #Hemoptysis: ddx pulmonary contusions from chest compressions vs. DAH
   vs. ariway trauma during intubation.  At this time airway blood seems
   to be significantly decreasing making DAH unlikely.
   -monitor hemoptysis
   -check repeat HCT, transfuse for <25
   # Altered mental status:contributing factors include infecton
   (UTI/PNA)/fevers/ hypernatremia and hypotension.  Head CT on admission
   unremarkable.
   - treat infection as above
   - correct hypernatremia
   # Hypernatremia: Free water deficit of approximately 1L based on Na
   145.
   - replete with D5 1L over 24 hours
   - f/u pm lytes
   .
   #Anemia -Previous w/u c/w anemia of chronic disease with normal
   folate/b12.  Currently with HCT trending down in setting of acute
   illness/hemoptysis and IVF
s.  This AM HCT <25

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frequent urinary tract infections. She presented with hypotension, fever, and altered mental status, which led to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on the floor. The patient was resuscitated and intubated.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, hemoptysis, altered mental status, hypernatremia, anemia, C. difficile colitis, COPD exacerbation, dysphagia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, and fecal incontinence. She is currently on various medications and treatments for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's diffuse alveolar infiltrates and low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicate the possibility of ARDS, likely due to aspiration.
2. Hypotension: Systemic inflammatory response secondary to pneumonia or pneumonitis may be contributing to the patient's hypotension.
3. Hemoptysis: The cause of hemoptysis could be trauma during intubation, pulmonary contusions from chest compressions, or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
4. Altered mental status: Infection, hypernatremia, and hypotension may contribute to the patient's altered mental status.
5. Hypernatremia"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill female with a history of cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, hypotension, and hemoptysis. She is currently intubated on ventilatory support and receiving multiple infusions. The patient has received significant fluids overnight to support her blood pressure, but her urinary output remains marginal. She is unable to pass a central line, and there is ongoing bleeding from her endotracheal tube.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are coming down, indicating some improvement in her cardiac function. However, she still has an altered mental status and is not able to communicate reliably. Her serum sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia, and she is receiving additional free water to address this issue.

The patient's respiratory status remains marginal, with concerns of capillary leak syndrome in the lungs due to aspiration. She is being placed on CPAP to improve oxygenation, and attempts will be made to reduce FiO2 later today.

Her hemoptysis has improved, but she is receiving a blood transfusion for worsening anemia. She remains on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and C. difficile infection. Bronchodilators are being continued for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, anemia, chronic extremity ulcers, and renal artery stenosis. There are concerns about her renal function, and higher driving pressures may be required to perfuse the kidneys.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and frequent urinary tract infections. She was admitted to the ICU following a cardiac arrest and intubation on the floor. The patient's main issues include hypotension, fever, altered mental status, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of aspiration due to a gastrostomy tube in place, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Klebsiella UTI: The patient has a Klebsiella urinary tract infection, which may require specific antibiotic treatment.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's CXR shows improvement in pulmonary edema, indicating a possible complication of fluid overload or heart failure.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and other risk factors may increase the risk of developing DVT.
6. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to infection or cardiac dysfunction.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, indicating possible dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.
8. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which can be further evaluated and treated appropriately"

   Pressure support 5  PEEP 10, with O2 sat of 95%.
   -continue with broad spectrum abx coverage of vanc, cefepime, flagyl
   which covers for aspiration pneumonia and Klebsiella UTI
   -continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -low suspicion for PE but she had LENI
s yesterday; f/u LENI
   -did poorly  on SBT this morning with desaturation, tachycardia and
   tachypnea; likely has component of pulmonary edema contributing to
   ventilator dependence, will try adding low dose metoprolol 2.5mg IV x1
   this morning as may have component of rate dependent edema.
 HYPOTENSION -> most likely [**3-6**] infection (UTI, aspiration pneumonia);
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim negative;
   -will try to hold off on IVF boluses today given evidence of pulmonary
   edema
   -bolus for low urine output, MAP <60
 CARDIAC ARREST -> PEA arrest on the floor resuscitated with atropine,
   epi and chest compressions.  Most likely cause at this time seems to be
   vagal stimulation in setting of aspiration and underlying UTI.
   Currently in sinus rhythm.
   -continue with management  as above
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 most likely [**3-6**] infection,
   hypotension and sedatives for intubation; Continue to correct
   hypernatremia slowly.  Patient has been non-verbal since prior to this
   admission.
 HEMOPTYSIS
 currently seems to have resolved
 ANEMIA, Acute on CHRONIC
anemia of chronic disease, with some blood
   loss on transfer [**3-6**] hemoptysis.  Transfused 1 unit PRBC yesterday, HCT
   this AM of 24.5
   -recheck HCT this pm and transfuse if continuing to trend down.
 DYSPHAGIA: NPO including medications;  pt with food particles
   suctioned from trachea on intubation, high suspicion for aspiration
   event leading to PEA arrest.
   -G-tube in place; high aspiration risk
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 continue to treat with free water
   flushes with tube feeds.
   -recent h/o C.diff colitis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was transferred to the ICU following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and intubation on the floor. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, most likely due to aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema. She is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and pressure support of 5 cmH2O with O2 saturation of 95%. The patient has several medical complications including infection, hypotension, cardiac arrest, altered mental status, hemoptysis, anemia, dysphagia, hypernatremia, COPD, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of frequent UTIs and current signs of infection such as fever and hypotension. She is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for aspiration pneumonia and Klebsiella UTI.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to infection or sepsis. She requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest on the floor, which was successfully resuscitated."

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), altered mental status, chronic anemia, hypotension, anemia of unknown cause, dysphagia, cardiac arrest, hemoptysis, and hypernatremia. The patient was resuscitated from a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. The patient has a history of lactose intolerance and allergies to sulfa, erythromycin base, and unknown allergens. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 96/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg, and fluid balance since 12 AM is positive at 5,565 mL with an input of 6,042 mL and output of 477 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.19, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 19 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 90 mmHg. The patient's laboratory values include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 20.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 7.6 g/dL, platelet count of 379 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 22 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 108 mg/dL, and lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and has been started on antibiotics for Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. The patient's plan includes a scheduled sleep study (SBT) this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Aspiration: The patient has a high aspiration risk due to dysphagia and the presence of a gastrostomy tube (G-tube).
3. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Additionally, the patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics for Klebsiella pneumoniae infection.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance since 12 AM is positive, indicating potential fluid overload"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The patient presented with hypotension, fever, altered mental status (AMS), and was found to have Klebsiella pneumoniae in her urine culture. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on the floor and required intubation.

The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema resulting from the PEA arrest. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) upon admission to the ICU indicates acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200. The patient's ventilatory requirements have been decreased over the past 24 hours, and she is currently on 50% FiO2 with pressure support of 5, PEEP of 10, and an oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover for aspiration pneumonia and Klebsiella UTI, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The plan is to continue weaning the FiO2 as tolerated. Given the patient's underlying COPD, there is a low suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE), but a lung endoth"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frequent urinary tract infections. She presented with hypotension, fever, altered mental status, and was found to have an aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was intubated on the floor. She was transferred to the ICU and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs have stabilized, but she continues to require high levels of oxygen and pressure support. She has a central venous line in place. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL. Her electrolytes are within normal limits except for a slightly low calcium level of 7.6 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal improvement in pulmonary edema and right lower lobe opacity consistent with aspiration.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's condition is complex and multifactorial. The most likely causes of her current condition include aspiration pneumonia, sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection, and possibly pulmonary edema contributing to ventilator dependence. The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, weaning off oxygen as tolerated, and attempting to hold off on intravenous fluid boluses due to"

   getting tachycardic and leading to increased pulmonary capillary wedge
   pressures in the setting of diastolic dysfunction. If BP stable today
   with acceptable urine output, would try to re-initiate beta blocker.
   Try to avoid fluid boluses of crystalloid today. Keep fluid balance

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who experienced cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and hypotension. They are currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's urine culture shows klebsiella, and they have received fluid resuscitation. Their urine output has improved, but they continue to have failed spontaneous breathing trials with a drop in oxygen saturations. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is elevated at 11 this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition suggests the possibility of ARDS due to respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia could progress and lead to worsening lung infection.
3. Sepsis: The presence of klebsiella in the urine culture indicates a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can potentially lead to sepsis, especially in critically ill patients.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, indicating potential fluid overload. This can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and further compromise respiratory function.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be due to agitation or the absence of a beta blocker. Tachycardia can increase pulmonary capillary wedge pressures and contribute to cardiac dysfunction.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may require careful management to avoid complications related"

s p/w hypotension, fever,
   AMS, Klebsiella [**Hospital **] transferred to ICU following PEA arrest and
   intubation on the floor.
 Hypoxic respiratory failure:  most likely [**3-6**] combination of
   aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema in setting of PEA
   arrest.  ABG on admission to ICU c/w ARDS with P:F <200.  Able to
   decrease ventillatory requirements over past 24 hours, now on 50% FIO2
   Pressure support 5  PEEP 10, with O2 sat of 95%.
   -continue with broad spectrum abx coverage of vanc, cefepime, flagyl
   which covers for aspiration pneumonia and Klebsiella UTI
   -continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -low suspicion for PE but she had LENI
s yesterday; f/u LENI
   -did poorly  on SBT this morning with desaturation, tachycardia and
   tachypnea; likely has component of pulmonary edema contributing to
   ventilator dependence, will try adding low dose metoprolol 2.5mg IV x1
   this morning as may have component of rate dependent edema.
 HYPOTENSION -> most likely [**3-6**] infection (UTI, aspiration pneumonia);
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim negative;
   -will try to hold off on IVF boluses today given evidence of pulmonary
   edema
   -bolus for low urine output, MAP <60
 CARDIAC ARREST -> PEA arrest on the floor resuscitated with atropine,
   epi and chest compressions.  Most likely cause at this time seems to be
   vagal stimulation in setting of aspiration and underlying UTI.
   Currently in sinus rhythm.
   -continue with management  as above
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 most likely [**3-6**] infection,
   hypotension and sedatives for intubation; Continue to correct
   hypernatremia slowly.  Patient has been non-verbal since prior to this
   admission.
 HEMOPTYSIS
 currently seems to have resolved
 ANEMIA, Acute on CHRONIC
anemia of chronic disease, with some blood
   loss on transfer [**3-6**] hemoptysis.  Transfused 1 unit PRBC yesterday, HCT
   this AM of 24.5
   -recheck HCT this pm and transfuse if continuing to trend down.
 DYSPHAGIA: NPO including medications;  pt with food particles
   suctioned from trachea on intubation, high suspicion for aspiration
   event leading to PEA arrest.
   -G-tube in place; high aspiration risk
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 continue to treat with free water
   flushes with tube feeds.
   -recent h/o C.diff colitis

","The patient is a 17-year-old female who presented with PEA arrest and was intubated on the floor. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving various treatments and medications. She has a history of anemia, altered mental status, hypotension, dysphagia, cardiac arrest, and hemoptysis.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal range, slightly low blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on the ventilator. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated but within normal limits. Her central venous pressure is within normal range.

The patient has received a transfusion of packed red blood cells due to a low hematocrit level. She has been receiving IV fluids and diuretics as well. The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume of 543 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are available but not specified in the note.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, as well as low hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient's troponin-T levels are slightly elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frequent urinary tract infections. She presented with hypotension, fever, altered mental status, and was found to have aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on the floor and was resuscitated with atropine, epinephrine, and chest compressions. She was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of frequent UTIs and now presents with aspiration pneumonia. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for these infections.
2. Respiratory failure: She has hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Her ABG on admission to the ICU showed ARDS with P:F <200. She is being weaned off ventilatory requirements but still requires mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac arrest: She experienced a PEA arrest on the floor and required resuscitation. The most likely cause seems to be vagal stimulation in the setting of aspiration and underlying UTI.
4. Hypernatremia: She has hypernatremia, which is being treated with free water flushes and careful management.
5. Anemia: She has acute anemia on chronic disease, likely due to blood loss from hemoptysis and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frequent urinary tract infections. She presented with hypotension, fever, altered mental status, and was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and intubation on the floor.

The patient was found to have hypoxic respiratory failure, most likely due to aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema following the PEA arrest. She has been improving daily in terms of ventilatory requirements and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI), which is favorable for extubation.

The patient tolerated diuresis and is now back on beta-blocker therapy. The plan is to extubate her today after administering additional oral metoprolol (to reach her home dose) and additional diuresis prior to extubation with intravenous Lasix. She will then be placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and continue with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.

The patient's hypotension is most likely due to infection (UTI, aspiration pneumonia) and is currently resolved. Her cardiac arrest was likely caused by vagal stimulation in the setting of aspiration and underlying UTI. She is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient also has altered mental status, most likely due to infection, hypotension, and sedatives for intubation. Her hypernat"

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus II, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was admitted to the ICU following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and intubation on the floor. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, but her respiratory support requirements have been decreasing daily. Her blood pressure remains low, and she is still on vasopressors. Her mental status has been altered since prior to admission, and she is not verbalizing. She has anemia due to chronic disease and some blood loss during transfer. She also has hypernatremia and a history of C. difficile colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating potential ongoing hypotension. This could be due to infection (UTI, aspiration pneumonia) or sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's clinical presentation suggests pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia given her dysphagia and food particles suctioned from the trachea on intubation.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's initial ABG results indicated ARDS with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <200. Although her respiratory support requirements have improved, there is still a risk of ARDS worsening or not fully resolving.
4. Infection: The patient"

   Palliative care following
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and frequent urinary tract infections. The patient was admitted to the ICU following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and intubation on the floor.

The patient has been improving daily, with decreasing ventilatory requirements and a favorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) this morning, suggesting the possibility of extubation. However, there are several potential medical complications that need to be considered:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial ABG results indicated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a poor oxygenation index (P:F <200). This suggests severe lung involvement, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to infection (UTI, aspiration pneumonia) or sepsis. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and provide appropriate fluid resuscitation and antibiotic treatment.

3. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest on the floor, which was successfully resuscitated with atropine, epinephrine, and chest compressions. The most likely cause appears to be vagal stimulation in the setting of aspiration and underlying UTI. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but ongoing monitoring is necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to a PEA arrest. She has a history of chronic anemia, altered mental status, and dysphagia. The patient has been extubated and placed on non-invasive ventilation with CPAP, which she tolerates well. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, blood pressure ranging from 133/55 to 206/89 mmHg, heart rate between 99-114 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation around 91%. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -4.5 L since yesterday.

Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and desaturations during activity indicate ongoing respiratory distress. Non-invasive CPAP is being used intermittently to improve oxygenation.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient appears to be at baseline according to the family, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the altered mental status.

3. Anemia, Chronic: The patient's hematocrit levels have been stable, indicating that her chronic anemia is being managed appropriately.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable and has resolved since yesterday.

5. History of Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient is receiving oral vancomycin to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old individual with a chief complaint of PEA arrest intubated on the floor. They were previously extubated to BIPAP but are now back on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of encephalopathy and allergies to sulfa, erythromycin base, and lactose intolerance. The patient has received antibiotics including metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefepime. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 133/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's weight is currently 43.6 kg, and their height is 58 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is -8 mmHg, with total fluid input of 1,699 mL and total fluid output of 6,280 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, standby ventilator mode, tidal volume (Vt) of 580 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.27, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 27 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 87 mmHg. The patient's ventilation rate is 5.7 L/min.

Physical examination reveals general appearance as thin, eyes/conjunctiva as poorly reactive and round, head/ears/nose/throat as normocephalic with a nasal trumpet in place, dry mucous membranes, and a facemask in place. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without murmurs, irregularly irregular rhythm, and no peripheral edema. Respiratory/chest examination reveals crackles bilaterally at the bases with good air entry. Abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, response to verbal stimuli, purposeful movement, and warm skin without rash or jaundice.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.4%, leukocyte count of 20.6 K/uL, platelet count of 379 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.13 ng/mL, lactate of 1.1 mmol/L, albumin of 2.4 g/dL, and lactic acid of 1.1 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female who was transferred to the ICU for a PEA (pulseless electrical activity) arrest. The patient has a history of lactose intolerance, allergies to sulfa, erythromycin base, and unknown allergies to cefipime, metronidazole, and vancomycin. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/64 to 206/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight has increased from 40.4 kg at admission to 43.6 kg currently.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, and medications such as lasix, metoprolol, cefipime, metronidazole, vancomycin, multivitamin, insulin, and Prozac. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, unresponsiveness, and protecting airway. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, lactate, and troponin-T levels. Other lab results are within normal range or show slight variations.

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name **])
   P:F ratio on transfer <200, has recently increased above 300 but
   decreasing today. Treat pneumonia w IV vanco, cefipime, metronidazole.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Month (only) 60**] be at baseline. Interactivity is not significant. If reversible, it
   will be from treatment of ARDS and anemia.
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Stable
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   More hypertension than hypotension lately; in setting of RVR, would
   increase metopropol to TID dosing, BPs should tolerate.
 DYSPHAGIA
   G-tube in place; high aspiration risk; monitor closely if extubated
 CARDIAC ARREST
   S/P PEA arrest. No recent arrhythmias; repleting lytes closely; today
   will aggressively replete K in face of K of 3.1.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-inch tall adult with a weight of 43.6 kg, admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes chronic anemia, dysphagia, cardiac arrest, and several allergies.

The patient's current vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 144 bpm, high blood pressure ranging from 124/43 to 185/88 mmHg, and tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 90% on high flow neb and CPAP. The patient's temperature is within normal limits, ranging from 37.1 to 37.2 degrees Celsius.

The patient has been experiencing multiple complications throughout their stay. They developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and were successfully managed with Lopressor. At 1 AM, the patient developed respiratory distress on high flow O2 facemask with tachypnea in the 30s and a saturation of 88%. The patient was given morphine and placed on noninvasive CPAP, resulting in improved oxygenation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values show mild abnormalities but are within acceptable ranges for an ICU patient.

The patient's physical examination reveals anxiety, di"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Pnuemonia/respiratory distress ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name **])
       Plan: - Continue bipap as a temporizing measure pending family
   discussion of goals of care.  If family wishes to continue full
   care/full code, then will intubate and place on mechanical ventilation
   if needed
                - Continue Cefepime, Vancomycin
   2)  Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
       Plan: Treat underlying respiratory problem
                 Metoprolol
   3)  ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
        - unclear
   4)  S/P PEA arrest likely secondary aspiration
   5)  Dysphagia
      Plan: G-tube in place; high aspiration risk
   6) ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Addendum: Discussed goals of care with the family.  At this point, if
   patient requires would re-intubate but does not want long-term care
   such as tracheostomy.  Also, if same situation arose again (extubated
   but then decompensated), would not want to re-intubate.  Continues do
   not resuscitate (CPR) status.  Will take patient off non-invasive
   ventilation and re-evaluate respiratory status.

The patient has a history of dementia/decreased level of consciousness, allergies to sulfa, erythromycin base, and lactose intolerance. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 100 bpm (normal range: 84-145 bpm), blood pressure of 185/88 mmHg (previous readings: 124/43-185/88 mmHg), respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute (normal range: 19-35 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's recent events include diuresis yesterday and doing well, but developing respiratory distress and tachycardia with increased secretions/sputum at approximately 7:00 AM. The patient also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The patient's physical examination reveals respiratory distress, symmetric chest expansion, and crackles in the lungs. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 510 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The"

   Assessment and Plan
 Leukocytosis
   WBC increased from 13.9 to 21.4 today.  Patient with multiple
   infectious sources including pneumonia, UTI, also with recent C.
   difficile colitis (though no diarrhea recently).  Does have left
   central line as well. Noninfectious etiologies of fever and
   leukocytosis such as PE, drug fever, adrenal insufficiency seem less
   likely at this time. Recently had LENIs negative for DVT.
   --Repeat blood and urine cultures
   --Broaden gram negative coverage to meropenem to cover more highly
   resistant gram negative pathogens
   --Check LFTs, amylase/lipase, follow up differential. Will hold off on
   pulling central line pending repeat blood cultures.
 h/o C. difficile colitis
   No diarrhea, abdomen nontender. Continue PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
 Aspiration and dysphagia
   Uncertain if aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis. Will be broadly
   covered on meropenem.
   G-tube in place; high aspiration risk. Elevated HOB and continue mouth
   care.
 Urinary tract infection
   Klebsiella pneumonia isolated from urine at admission, should have been
   covered with cefepime. As patient still has foley possibility for
   treatment failure or recurrent UTI exists. Repeat urinalysis and urine
   cultures.  Change foley if UA positive.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and ?cerebral
   hypoxia from PEA arrest. Uncertain if this is new baseline. Will
   follow, treating infections. Holding off on LP at this time.
 Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Continue metoprolol TID, increase further today. Continue to monitor on
   telemetry. No anticoagulation giving risk of bleeding.
Hypothyroidism
   Continue levothyroxine
 Diabetes
   Continue fingersticks with insulin sliding scale

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous stroke, and recent Clostridium difficile colitis. She presented with fever and altered mental status and was found to have a urinary tract infection. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest likely due to aspiration. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has minimal improvement in bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's leukocyte count has increased from 13.9 to 21.4 today, indicating leukocytosis. There are multiple infectious sources including pneumonia, UTI, and recent C. difficile colitis. Non-infectious causes of fever and leukocytosis seem less likely at this time. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest pneumonia, which can be a complication of aspiration.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Klebsiella pneumoniae has been isolated from her urine, indicating a UTI. This could lead to complications such as sepsis or kidney infection.
3. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which can recur and cause severe diarrhea and dehydration.
4. Aspiration: The patient's high risk of aspiration due to dysphagia and G-tube placement can lead to aspiration pneumonia or other respiratory complications.

   Assessment and Plan
 Leukocytosis
   WBC increased from 13.9 to 21.4 today.  Patient with multiple
   infectious sources including pneumonia, UTI, also with recent C.
   difficile colitis (though no diarrhea recently).  Does have left
   central line as well. Noninfectious etiologies of fever and
   leukocytosis such as PE, drug fever, adrenal insufficiency seem less
   likely at this time. Recently had LENIs negative for DVT.
   --Repeat blood and urine cultures
   --Broaden gram negative coverage to meropenem to cover more highly
   resistant gram negative pathogens
   --Check LFTs, amylase/lipase, follow up differential. Will hold off on
   pulling central line pending repeat blood cultures.
 h/o C. difficile colitis
   No diarrhea, abdomen nontender. Continue PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
 Aspiration and dysphagia
   Uncertain if aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis. Will be broadly
   covered on meropenem.
   G-tube in place; high aspiration risk. Elevated HOB and continue mouth
   care.
 Urinary tract infection
   Klebsiella pneumonia isolated from urine at admission, should have been
   covered with cefepime. As patient still has foley possibility for
   treatment failure or recurrent UTI exists. Repeat urinalysis and urine
   cultures.  Change foley if UA positive.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and ?cerebral
   hypoxia from PEA arrest. Uncertain if this is new baseline. Will
   follow, treating infections. Holding off on LP at this time.
 Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Continue metoprolol TID, increase further today. Continue to monitor on
   telemetry. No anticoagulation giving risk of bleeding.
Hypothyroidism
   Continue levothyroxine
 Diabetes
   Continue fingersticks with insulin sliding scale
 COPD, on 2L/min at home during night
   Continue albuterol PRN
 CAD
   Continue beta blocker, holding ASA [**3-6**] hemoptysis earlier in admission
 CHF diastolic EF 60% 7/07
   Continue rate control with metoprolol. Goal net even today. Replete
   K>4, Magnesium>2
 Anemia
   Hct stable without active bleeding, follow
 Depression and anxiety
   Continue home sertraline

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of CAD, COPD, h/o stroke, and recent C. difficile colitis. She presented with fever and altered mental status, which was found to be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of likely aspiration and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation, but it was stopped after a period of time. She has bronchial breath sounds bilaterally, indicating the presence of pneumonia. Her labs show leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and elevated liver enzymes. The WBC count has increased from 13.9 to 21.4 today. Her blood cultures were negative initially but her urine culture showed yeast and subsequently grew Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin.

The patient's current medical complications include pneumonia, UTI, and possible C. difficile colitis. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), anemia, depression, anxiety, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and a history of COPD and CHF.

The assessment and plan include repeating blood and urine cultures, broadening gram-negative coverage to meropenem to cover more resistant pathogens, checking liver function tests (LFTs), amylase/lipase levels, and following up with a differential. The central line will"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 15-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to a PEA (Pulseless Electrical Activity) arrest. The patient experienced respiratory distress and required non-invasive ventilation from 8:30 AM on 2/29 to 1:12 PM. An EKG was performed at 12:44 PM. The patient has a history of lactose intolerance and allergies to sulfonamides, erythromycin, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate between 74-126 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 60-173/47-93 mmHg, respiratory rate between 22-41 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, trace edema in both lower extremities, and muscle wasting. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive, does not follow simple commands, and exhibits non-purposeful movements.

The patient's laboratory results show low hemoglobin levels (11.5 g/dL), elevated white blood cell count (21.4 K/uL), high creatinine levels (0.8 mg/dL), and decreased albumin levels (2.4 g/dL). The patient's arterial blood gas values are not provided.

   Assessment and Plan
 Leukocytosis
   WBC trended back down today with improved fever curve and chest
   radiograph. ?Resolving aspiration pneumonia. Changing cefepime to
   meropenem yesterday for broader coverage; could have more extensively
   resistant ICU-acquired gram negative infection. Will continue
   vancomycin/meropenem for now. No new culture data. LFTS, amylase and
   lipase sent yesterday and unremarkable.
   --Follow up cultures, repeat if febrile. Can defer on pulling central
   line at this time.
 Oliguria
   Urine output decreased overnight, will continue maintenance IVFs and
   consider NS bolus as needed if CVP<8.
 h/o C. difficile colitis
   No diarrhea, abdomen nontender. Continue PO vancomycin. Can DC IV
   flagyl.
 Aspiration and dysphagia
   Uncertain if aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis. Will be broadly
   covered on meropenem.
   G-tube in place, will restart tube feeds with reglan today. Elevated
   HOB and continue mouth care.
   [**Month (only) 60**] need tracheostomy to decrease risk of aspirating oral secretions,
   will need to be discussed with family
 Urinary tract infection
   Klebsiella pneumonia isolated from urine at admission, should have been
   covered with cefepime. As patient still has foley possibility for
   treatment failure or recurrent UTI exists. Repeat urinalysis and urine
   cultures.  Change foley if urine culture positive.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and ?cerebral
   hypoxia from PEA arrest. Uncertain if this is new baseline. Will
   follow, treating infections. No need for LP or head imaging at this
   time. Replete electrolytes prn, treat infections as above.
 Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Continue metoprolol TID, can titrate further as BP tolerates if needed
   for additional HR control today. Continue to monitor on telemetry. No
   anticoagulation giving risk of bleeding.
Hypothyroidism
   Continue levothyroxine
 Diabetes
   Continue fingersticks with insulin sliding scale
 COPD, on 2L/min at home during night
   Continue albuterol PRN
 CAD
   Continue beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 369**] 81mg daily
 CHF diastolic EF 60% 7/07
   Continue rate control with metoprolol. Goal net even today. Replete
   K>4, Magnesium>2
 Anemia
   Hematocrit slightly decreased today. No evidence of gross active
   bleeding. Suspect decrease may reflect fluids in part. Guiac stools,
   follow for now.
 Depression and anxiety
   Continue home sertraline
   ICU Care

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, COPD, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and a history of C. difficile colitis. The patient presented to the ICU with altered mental status, fever, leukocytosis, and poor urine output. Cultures were obtained, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or worsening of COPD exacerbation.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is resistant to some antibiotics. There is a possibility of recurrent UTI or treatment failure.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's dysphagia and altered mental status, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to cover this possibility.

4. C. difficile Colitis: Although the patient does not currently have diarrhea, there is a history of C. difficile colitis. Continued surveillance for symptoms of C. difficile infection is necessary.

5. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is very poor despite IV fluids. Ongoing monitoring and management of fluid balance and renal function are crucial.

6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is poor, likely due to a combination of factors including infection, potential cerebral hypoxia from previous cardiac arrest, and underlying medical conditions. Ongoing assessment and treatment of infections are important for potential improvement.

7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Rate control is being managed with metoprolol, but ongoing monitoring and titration of medication may be necessary.

8. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has slightly decreased. Further investigation into the cause of anemia is needed, and blood products may be required if significant bleeding is identified.

9. Depression and Anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety. Continued mental health support is important during this ICU stay.

10. Hypothyroidism and Diabetes: The patient has ongoing management of hypothyroidism and diabetes, including levothyroxine and insulin sliding scale, respectively.

11. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has a history of CHF with a preserved ejection fraction and CAD. Ongoing monitoring of heart function and rate control is necessary.

12. Line-Related Complications: The patient has multiple lines in place, including a multi-lumen central line. Close monitoring for line-related infections is essential.

13. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Continued use of PPI may be necessary.

14. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Monitoring for signs of bleeding or thrombosis is necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
 Leukocytosis
   WBC trended back down today with improved fever curve and chest
   radiograph. ?Resolving aspiration pneumonia. Changing cefepime to
   meropenem yesterday for broader coverage; could have more extensively
   resistant ICU-acquired gram negative infection. Will continue
   vancomycin/meropenem for now. No new culture data. LFTS, amylase and
   lipase sent yesterday and unremarkable.
   --Follow up cultures, repeat if febrile. Can defer on pulling central
   line at this time.
 Oliguria
   Urine output decreased overnight, will continue maintenance IVFs and
   consider NS bolus as needed if CVP<8.
 h/o C. difficile colitis
   No diarrhea, abdomen nontender. Continue PO vancomycin. Can DC IV
   flagyl.
 Aspiration and dysphagia
   Uncertain if aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis. Will be broadly
   covered on meropenem.
   G-tube in place; high aspiration risk. Elevated HOB and continue mouth
   care.
   [**Month (only) 60**] need tracheostomy
 Urinary tract infection
   Klebsiella pneumonia isolated from urine at admission, should have been
   covered with cefepime. As patient still has foley possibility for
   treatment failure or recurrent UTI exists. Repeat urinalysis and urine
   cultures.  Change foley if urine culture positive.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and ?cerebral
   hypoxia from PEA arrest. Uncertain if this is new baseline. Will
   follow, treating infections. No need for LP or head imaging at this
   time. Replete electrolytes prn, treat infections as above.
 Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Continue metoprolol TID, can titrate further as BP tolerates if needed
   for additional HR control today. Continue to monitor on telemetry. No
   anticoagulation giving risk of bleeding.
Hypothyroidism
   Continue levothyroxine
 Diabetes
   Continue fingersticks with insulin sliding scale
 COPD, on 2L/min at home during night
   Continue albuterol PRN
 CAD
   Continue beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 369**] 81mg daily

 Anemia
   Hematocrit slightly decreased today. No evidence of gross active
   bleeding. Suspect decrease may reflect fluids in part. Guiac stools,
   follow for now.
 Depression and anxiety

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including COPD, CAD, CHF, diabetes, hypothyroidism, depression, and anxiety. He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, likely related to an infection. He has been febrile and leukocytosis has been present, indicating a possible infection. The patient's urine output has been poor despite receiving IV fluids. He has a history of C. difficile colitis but currently does not have diarrhea. He also has aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis and is at high risk for aspiration due to a G-tube in place. The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is being treated with metoprolol. He has multiple positive cultures for different organisms, including Klebsiella pneumoniae in the urine. The patient's current goals of care are being discussed with his family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been febrile and leukocytosis indicates a possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started but there is concern for an ICU-acquired, extensively resistant gram-negative infection. Cultures are pending to guide further treatment.
2. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is very poor despite receiving IV fluids. This could be due to acute kidney injury or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Aspiration: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
 Leukocytosis
   WBC increased from 13.9 to 21.4 today.  Patient with multiple
   infectious sources including pneumonia, UTI, also with recent C.
   difficile colitis (though no diarrhea recently).  Does have left
   central line as well. Noninfectious etiologies of fever and
   leukocytosis such as PE, drug fever, adrenal insufficiency seem less
   likely at this time. Recently had LENIs negative for DVT.
   --Repeat blood and urine cultures
   --Broaden gram negative coverage to meropenem to cover more highly
   resistant gram negative pathogens
   --Check LFTs, amylase/lipase, follow up differential. Will hold off on
   pulling central line pending repeat blood cultures.
 h/o C. difficile colitis
   No diarrhea, abdomen nontender. Continue PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
 Aspiration and dysphagia
   Uncertain if aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis. Will be broadly
   covered on meropenem.
   G-tube in place; high aspiration risk. Elevated HOB and continue mouth
   care.
 Urinary tract infection
   Klebsiella pneumonia isolated from urine at admission, should have been
   covered with cefepime. As patient still has foley possibility for
   treatment failure or recurrent UTI exists. Repeat urinalysis and urine
   cultures.  Change foley if UA positive.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and ?cerebral
   hypoxia from PEA arrest. Uncertain if this is new baseline. Will
   follow, treating infections. Holding off on LP at this time.
 Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Continue metoprolol TID, increase further today. Continue to monitor on
   telemetry. No anticoagulation giving risk of bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, COPD, diabetes, depression, anxiety, and hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, fever, leukocytosis, and poor urine output.

During the 24-hour period, the patient's condition has worsened. The patient developed febrile leukocytosis and was found to have Klebsiella pneumoniae in the urine, indicating a urinary tract infection. The patient's respiratory status has also deteriorated, with crackles heard in the posterior lung fields. The patient's neurologic status remains poor, with non-purposeful movements and no follow-up commands.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. Blood cultures have been taken, but results are pending. The patient's medications include metoprolol, fluoxetine, lansoprazole, and heparin subcutaneously.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated leukocyte count and presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the urine suggest a urinary tract infection. Additionally, the patient's respiratory symptoms indicate the possibility of pneumonia. These infections can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's decreased urine output may"

   Assessment and Plan
 Leukocytosis
   WBC increased from 13.9 to 21.4 today.  Patient with multiple
   infectious sources including pneumonia, UTI, also with recent C.
   difficile colitis (though no diarrhea recently).  Does have left
   central line as well. Noninfectious etiologies of fever and
   leukocytosis such as PE, drug fever, adrenal insufficiency seem less
   likely at this time. Recently had LENIs negative for DVT.
   --Repeat blood and urine cultures
   --Broaden gram negative coverage to meropenem to cover more highly
   resistant gram negative pathogens
   --Check LFTs, amylase/lipase, follow up differential. Will hold off on
   pulling central line pending repeat blood cultures.
 h/o C. difficile colitis
   No diarrhea, abdomen nontender. Continue PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
 Aspiration and dysphagia
   Uncertain if aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis. Will be broadly
   covered on meropenem.
   G-tube in place; high aspiration risk. Elevated HOB and continue mouth
   care.
 Urinary tract infection
   Klebsiella pneumonia isolated from urine at admission, should have been
   covered with cefepime. As patient still has foley possibility for
   treatment failure or recurrent UTI exists. Repeat urinalysis and urine
   cultures.  Change foley if UA positive.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and ?cerebral
   hypoxia from PEA arrest. Uncertain if this is new baseline. Will
   follow, treating infections. Holding off on LP at this time.
 Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Continue metoprolol TID, increase further today. Continue to monitor on
   telemetry. No anticoagulation giving risk of bleeding.
Hypothyroidism
   Continue levothyroxine
 Diabetes
   Continue fingersticks with insulin sliding scale
 COPD, on 2L/min at home during night
   Continue albuterol PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, diabetes, COPD, CAD, CHF, and depression/anxiety.
- She was admitted to the ICU with an altered mental status, likely due to an infection and possible cerebral hypoxia from a previous cardiac arrest.
- The patient has been febrile with leukocytosis and has multiple infectious sources, including pneumonia, UTI, and recent C. difficile colitis.
- The patient's fever resolved after changing antibiotics from cefepime to meropenem.
- She has poor urine output despite IV fluids and a history of Klebsiella pneumonia isolated from her urine at admission.
- The patient has a G-tube in place, indicating a high risk of aspiration.
- She has altered mental status but is not delirious, and it is uncertain if this is a new baseline.
- The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is on metoprolol.
- She also has hypothyroidism, diabetes, COPD, CAD, CHF, anemia, and depression/anxiety.
- The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole, metoprolol, fluoxetine, lansoprazole, and heparin.
- The patient's family has agreed to continue aggressive care.

 Leukocytosis
   WBC trended back down today with improved fever curve and chest
   radiograph. ?Resolving aspiration pneumonia. Changing cefepime to
   meropenem yesterday for broader coverage; could have more extensively
   resistant ICU-acquired gram negative infection. Will continue
   vancomycin/meropenem for now. No new culture data. LFTS, amylase and
   lipase sent yesterday and unremarkable.
   --Follow up cultures, repeat if febrile. Can defer on pulling central
   line at this time.
 Oliguria
   Urine output decreased overnight, will continue maintenance IVFs and
   consider NS bolus as needed if CVP<8.
 h/o C. difficile colitis
   No diarrhea, abdomen nontender. Continue PO vancomycin. Can DC IV
   flagyl.
 Aspiration and dysphagia
   Uncertain if aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis. Will be broadly

 Urinary tract infection
   Klebsiella pneumonia isolated from urine at admission, should have been
   covered with cefepime. As patient still has foley possibility for
   treatment failure or recurrent UTI exists. Repeat urinalysis and urine
   cultures.  Change foley if urine culture positive.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and ?cerebral
   hypoxia from PEA arrest. Uncertain if this is new baseline. Will
   follow, treating infections. No need for LP or head imaging at this
   time. Replete electrolytes prn, treat infections as above.
 Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Continue metoprolol TID, can titrate further as BP tolerates if needed
   for additional HR control today. Continue to monitor on telemetry. No
   anticoagulation giving risk of bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a chronically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, diabetes, COPD, CHF, CAD, hypothyroidism, and depression/anxiety. They were admitted to the ICU due to an altered mental status following a PEA arrest. The patient has been febrile, with leukocytosis and resolution of fever after changing antibiotics from cefepime to meropenem. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia, which may be resolved based on the improved fever curve and chest radiograph. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to COPD and potential aspiration pneumonia, the patient is at risk of further respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxia or respiratory failure.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is resistant to certain antibiotics, was isolated from the urine culture. This suggests a possible recurrent or persistent UTI despite previous treatment.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's urine output is poor despite receiving IV fluids, indicating a possible renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
4. Delirium/Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which can be attributed to various factors including infection, cerebral hypoxia from the PEA arrest, or underlying chronic illnesses.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, CHF, and CAD,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presented to the ICU with an altered mental status and was found to have leukocytosis. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but developed fevers and his leukocytosis worsened. The patient's urine output has been very poor despite IV fluids, and he has a history of chronic kidney disease. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's blood cultures were drawn due to suspicion of sepsis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, leukocytosis, and poor urine output, there is a concern for sepsis, especially considering his immunocompromised state.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and history of chronic kidney disease make him at risk for developing AKI.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's current respiratory support and the presence of crackles in his chest suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient's history of C. difficile infection increases his risk for recurrence, particularly given his recent antibiotic use.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is a PEA arrest. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including chronic anemia, dysphagia, cardiac arrest secondary to aspiration, hemoptysis (resolved), diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, heart failure (diastolic, chronic), and C. difficile infection.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit, with a maximum temperature of 38 degrees Celsius. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits at 82 beats per minute. Blood pressure readings are variable, ranging from 105/40 mmHg to 155/67 mmHg. Respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 26 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 94% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg.

The patient has been suctioned regularly due to ongoing production of oral secretions in the airway, indicating ongoing aspiration. This has led to a diagnosis of pneumonia, aspiration. The patient also has leukocytosis and an altered mental status, which is not delirium. There is a history of C. difficile infection, for which the patient is being treated with Flagyl.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Blood glucose levels are"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC
 seems to have had acute on
   chronic decompensation last night
   -          continue metoprolol 5mg IV q4h, uptitrate as tolerated
   -          diurese today with goal of -500cc to 1000cc
   -          continue supplemental O2
   -          prn nitrate, morphine for any decompensation
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   -          now afebrile, follow clinical status and serial CXRs for
   improvement
   -          Continue vanc/meropenem, 10- 14 day course
 LEUKOCYTOSIS
 stable, attributable to aspiration PNA
   -          continue systemic vancomycin/meropenem for now
   -          f/u cultures, no bug identified as yet
 DYSPHAGIA: G-tube in place; high aspiration risk, now G tube unable
   to flush or use
   -          only alternative would be surgical or endoscopic. Very poor
   candidate for either intervention
   -          may have to receive TPN
   -          can hold reglan in meantime
   -          meds have to be delivered IV
 .H/O C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE)
   -          diarrhea decreased
   -          Continue PO vancomycin (? Failed Flagyl previously)
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   -          HCTs stable, stool guaiac negative. Monitor daily
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   -          Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and
   ?cerebral hypoxia from PEA arrest. Uncertain if this is new baseline.
   Will follow, treating infections. No need for LP or head imaging at
   this time. Replete electrolytes prn, treat infections as above
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   - isolated on admission, now resolved, subsequent cultures negative
 h/o Atrial fibrillation with RVR
 currently in sinus
   -          Continue metoprolol as above
   -          Not an anticoagulation candidate
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   -          uptitrate insulin sliding scale
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   -          Continue levothyroxine
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   - Continue metoprolol as above, continue ASA 81mg daily

   Disposition:Transfer to other facility
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a frail elderly individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), aspiration pneumonia, chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

The patient's current conditions include acute-on-chronic decompensation of CHF, aspiration pneumonia, leukocytosis, dysphagia with a high aspiration risk, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), urinary tract infection (UTI) that has since resolved, and altered mental status. 

The patient's treatment plan involves continuing medications for heart failure, pneumonia, and diabetes. They are also receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's nutritional needs are being met through tube feeding, but there are issues with the functioning of the gastrointestinal (G) tube. Glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale. 

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) but may intubate. The disposition plan includes discussing options such as transfer to another facility or hospice care."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted with aspiration pneumonia and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Heart failure: The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure with acute decompensation. There are plans to continue metoprolol, diurese, and provide supplemental O2.

2. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient is at high risk for aspiration due to dysphagia, and the aspiration pneumonia is already present. The treatment involves continuing vancomycin and meropenem for 10-14 days.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has stable leukocytosis, which is likely attributable to the aspiration pneumonia. Systemic vancomycin and meropenem will be continued, and cultures will be followed.

4. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia with a G-tube in place, which increases the risk of aspiration. The G-tube is currently unable to flush or use, so contact IR is needed for declotting or replacement.

5. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection. Diarrhea has decreased, and PO vancomycin will be continued after the G-tube placement.

6. Anemia, chronic: The patient has chronic anemia with stable HCTs and negative stool guaiac. Monitoring will be done daily.

7. Altered mental status: The patient has poor mental"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a frail, elderly individual with a history of aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including leukocytosis, altered mental status, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, chronic anemia, dysphagia, cardiac arrest, hemoptysis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and chronic heart failure.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/52 to 199/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nebulizer.
- The patient's physical examination reveals thinness, frailty, and muscle wasting. There are clear breath sounds bilaterally with diminished breath sounds at the bases. The patient is unable to stand or walk.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate levels.
- Imaging shows repositioning of the right PICC line with the distal tip appropriately located in the mid superior vena cava. The left internal jugular line tip is in the mid-low superior vena cava without azygous vein continuation. There is also a looped catheter projecting over the mid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a frail elderly individual with multiple medical conditions including aspiration pneumonia, chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of their complex condition.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to aspiration pneumonia, there is a risk of worsening respiratory symptoms, such as increased cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen saturation.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and coronary artery disease puts them at risk for further cardiac issues, including congestive heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Infection-related Complications: Given the patient's previous C. difficile infection and the presence of urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia, there is a possibility of developing additional infections or experiencing a worsening of existing infections.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of C. difficile infection increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or colitis.
5. Nutritional Complications: Due to dysphagia and the inability to feed orally, the patient is at risk for malnutrition and inadequate nutritional support.
6. Hematological Complications: The presence of leukocytosis and chronic anemia indicates potential complications related to"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 58-year-old individual with multiple medical conditions including chronic anemia, chronic diabetes mellitus type II, dysphagia, heart failure (diastolic), hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing altered mental status, leukocytosis, pneumonia, UTI, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient underwent a G-tube placement and has a high aspiration risk. The patient's family did not show up as scheduled.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia, and there is a risk of worsening or developing a new infection due to the presence of aspiration risk and the use of a G-tube.
2. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which may progress or lead to kidney infection if not properly managed.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, and there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of symptoms if appropriate measures are not taken.
4. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has chronic heart failure, and any additional stress or complications can lead to an exacerbation of heart failure symptoms.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism needs to be managed appropriately to avoid complications related to an underactive thyroid gland.
6. Diabetes complications: The patient's diabetes may increase the risk of complications such as"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a complex medical history and current ICU admission. The patient has been admitted with fever and altered mental status, with recent urinary tract infection (UTI) and Clostridium difficile colitis. She also had a previous episode of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was treated for aspiration pneumonia.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. She is currently receiving various medications including metoprolol, aspirin, vancomycin, meropenem, fluoxetine, and heparin.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 162/61 mmHg to 85/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula, and temperature of 36.9°C.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and low potassium level. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, normal amylase and lipase levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,552 mL and output of 2,450 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -898 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results are pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals general appearance of being thin, eyes with pinpoint pupils, cardiovascular examination showing normal heart sounds without murmurs, respiratory examination showing crackles bilaterally, and neurologic examination indicating nonverbal status.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, recurrent pneumonia or aspiration events, further episodes of delirium or altered mental status, progression of C. difficile infection, and potential infections due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Additionally, the patient's chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease require ongoing management.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple complex medical issues requiring careful monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She is unresponsive and unable to provide her own history. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including leukocytosis, altered mental status, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, C. difficile infection, chronic anemia, dysphagia, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. The patient's prognosis is very poor due to her inability to prevent future aspiration and recurrent pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

1. Recurrent pneumonia: Due to the patient's dysphagia and high aspiration risk, she is prone to developing recurrent pneumonia.

2. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which can recur if not properly managed.

3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure, which may worsen if her cardiac function is not closely monitored and managed.

4. Diabetic complications: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, which can lead to various complications if not well-controlled, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.

5. Hypothyroidism-related complications: The patient's hypothyroidism can lead to complications such as myxedema coma if not properly managed.

6. Coronary artery disease-related complications: The patient"

The patient, a 66-year-old female, is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. She has a history of pneumonia, heart failure (diastolic), dysphagia with a G-tube in place, chronic anemia, altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101F, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/55 mmHg to 151/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on various medications including vancomycin, meropenem, furosemide, metoprolol, aspirin, ferrous sulfate, fluoxetine, heparin, lansoprazole, levothyroxine, and insulin sliding scale.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values indicate abnormal liver function tests, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated levels of lactate and lactic acid.

The patient's recent events include being febrile last night with blood cultures sent, need for frequent suctioning due to thick tan secretions, and a discussion with the palliative"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 103] is a 58-year-old female patient with multiple comorbidities, including chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, anemia, and a history of coronary artery disease. She is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia, aspiration, and chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is on mechanical ventilation. She is also receiving tube feeds.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has moderate Staphylococcus aureus and yeast growth in her sputum culture. This indicates a bacterial infection in the lungs.
2. Aspiration: The patient has thick tan secretions and requires frequent suctioning, suggesting a risk of aspiration.
3. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, which may worsen due to the ongoing infection and respiratory distress.
4. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia, as indicated by the presence of a G-tube. This increases the risk of aspiration.
5. Clostridium difficile infection: Although the patient does not currently have diarrhea or abdominal tenderness, she has a history of C. difficile infection. It is important to continue oral vancomycin for two weeks after completing broad-spectrum antibiotics.
6. Anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia, which may be related"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a chronically ill individual with multiple medical conditions including pneumonia, aspiration, heart failure, dysphagia, C. difficile infection, anemia, altered mental status, urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's current symptoms include fever overnight, increased secretions, and difficulty breathing. The leukocytosis is resolving without worsening oxygen requirement. The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and is being treated with oral vancomycin. The patient also has chronic macrocytic anemia, which may be related to thyroid disease or other hematologic processes. 

The patient's vital signs show tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there are episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's neurologic status is poor, with no attentive response or following of simple commands.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels. The kidney function is slightly impaired with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. The liver function tests are within normal limits, but the patient has an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level.

   We have informed patient's daughters that long term prognosis is dismal

   to continue to have recurrenbt exacerbations of her pulmonary

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with multiple comorbidities including chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She presented with a sudden onset of altered mental status, leukocytosis, and fever. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and aspiration. The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's condition continues to deteriorate, with worsening secretions and a poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia, which is worsening due to her inability to clear secretions. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or sepsis.
2. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which can lead to bacteremia and further complications if not appropriately managed.
3. Aspiration: The patient has a high aspiration risk due to dysphagia and the presence of a G-tube. Aspiration pneumonia or lung abscesses may develop if aspirated material enters the lower respiratory tract.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen due to fluid overload, infection, or inadequate cardiac function.
5. Diabetic Complications: Poor glycemic control in the context of critical illness"

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   No worsening of O2 requirements, currently afebrile. MRSA isolated from
   sputum [**3-2**], suspect this may be colonization rather than infection.
   - Discontinue meropenem. Complete 14 day course of vancomycin.
   - Continue routine suctioning, follow up cultures
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC
   - Continue metoprolol, diurese goal net even to -500cc today
 DYSPHAGIA: G-tube in place; high aspiration risk
 H/O C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE)
   -          No diarrhea or abdominal tenderness currently
   -          Continue PO vancomycin for two weeks after broad spectrum
   antibiotics completed
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC. Macrocytic anemia less c/w iron deficiency
 may be
   due to her thyroid disease versus other hematologic process as recent
   folate and B12 were normal recently. Iron panel was normal [**2156-1-14**].
   Hemolysis labs sent yesterday b/c of slight drop in Hct, showed low
   haptoglobin and elevated LDH but normal LDH. Stoosl guiac negative
   -          Hct stable, follow up DAT
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   -          Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and
   ?cerebral hypoxia from PEA arrest, follow.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   -          Klebsiella isolated on admission, repeat urine culture
   negative
 h/o Atrial fibrillation with RVR
 currently in sinus rhythm
   -          Titrate up metoprolol as BP tolerates
   -          Not an anticoagulation candidate
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   -          Continue insulin sliding scale
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   -          Continue levothyroxine

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of fever and altered mental status, recent C. difficile colitis, and previous PEA arrest due to aspiration pneumonia. She has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, chronic anemia, and chronic diastolic heart failure.

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and aspiration. Her sputum culture on day 3 showed moderate MRSA and yeast, but the infection may be colonization rather than infection. The plan is to discontinue meropenem and complete a 14-day course of vancomycin.

She also has a history of C. difficile infection, for which she is continuing to receive oral vancomycin for two weeks after completing broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her dysphagia requires a G-tube placement, and she is at high risk for aspiration.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 21.4 thousand/mm3, Hct of 34.6%, platelet count of 528 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 138 mg/dL, and sodium of 135 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 128/38 mmHg,"

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   No worsening of O2 requirements, currently afebrile. MRSA isolated from
   sputum [**3-2**], may be colonization rather than infection.
   - Discontinue meropenem. Complete 14 day course of vancomycin.
   - Continue routine suctioning, follow up cultures
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC
   - Continue metoprolol, diurese goal net -500 to -1000cc today
 DYSPHAGIA: G-tube in place; high aspiration risk
 H/O C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE)
   -          No diarrhea or abdominal tenderness currently
   -          Continue PO vancomycin for two weeks after broad spectrum
   antibiotics completed
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC. Macrocytic anemia less c/w iron deficiency
 may be
   due to her thyroid disease versus other hematologic process as recent
   folate and B12 were normal recently. Iron panel was normal [**2156-1-14**].
   Hemolysis labs sent yesterday b/c of slight drop in Hct, showed low
   haptoglobin and elevated LDH but normal LDH. Stoosl guiac negative, DAT
   negative.
   -          Hct stable, follow
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   -          Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and
   ?cerebral hypoxia from PEA arrest, follow.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   -          Klebsiella isolated on admission, repeat urine culture
   negative
 h/o Atrial fibrillation with RVR
 currently in sinus rhythm
   -          Titrate up metoprolol as BP tolerates
   -          Not an anticoagulation candidate
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   -          Continue insulin sliding scale
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   -          Continue levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of fever and altered mental status. She recently had C. difficile colitis and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU, where she is being treated for pneumonia and chronic heart failure. She also has dysphagia, chronic anemia, altered mental status, a urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 128/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on high-flow nasal cannula. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.4 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 29.9%, and elevated troponin-T level of 662. The patient's plan includes discontinuing meropenem, completing a 14-day course of vancomycin, and continuing routine suctioning and follow-up cultures. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of oxygen requirements, MRSA infection, heart failure exacerbation, dysphagia-related aspiration, Clostridium difficile infection recurrence, anemia progression, altered mental status deterioration, urinary tract infection recurrence, and diabetes mellitus"

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   No worsening of O2 requirements, currently afebrile. MRSA isolated from
   sputum [**3-2**], suspect this may be colonization rather than infection.
   - Discontinue meropenem. Complete 14 day course of vancomycin.
   - Continue routine suctioning, follow up cultures
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC
   - Continue metoprolol, diurese goal net even to -500cc today
 DYSPHAGIA: G-tube in place; high aspiration risk
 H/O C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE)
   -          No diarrhea or abdominal tenderness currently
   -          Continue PO vancomycin for two weeks after broad spectrum
   antibiotics completed
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC. Macrocytic anemia less c/w iron deficiency
 may be
   due to her thyroid disease versus other hematologic process as recent
   folate and B12 were normal recently. Iron panel was normal [**2156-1-14**].
   Hemolysis labs sent yesterday b/c of slight drop in Hct, showed low
   haptoglobin and elevated LDH but normal LDH. Stoosl guiac negative
   -          Hct stable, follow up DAT
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   -          Poor status at baseline with added insult of infection and
   ?cerebral hypoxia from PEA arrest, follow.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   -          Klebsiella isolated on admission, repeat urine culture
   negative
 h/o Atrial fibrillation with RVR
 currently in sinus rhythm
   -          Titrate up metoprolol as BP tolerates
   -          Not an anticoagulation candidate
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   -          Continue insulin sliding scale

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a complex medical history, including pneumonia, aspiration, heart failure, dysphagia, anemia, altered mental status, urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. She is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 128/38-60 to 153/54 mmHg, heart rate between 74 and 108 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the bilateral bases of the lungs, absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, and warm skin. Neurologically, she is not following simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and opens her eyes to voice. Her mental status is poor but stable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests indicate a normal creatinine level. Other lab values are within normal ranges, except for lactic acid levels which are slightly elevated. Imaging studies have not shown any significant findings.

The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA-positive sputum, but it is suspected to be colonization rather than an active infection. The plan is to discontinue mer"

","The patient is an elderly woman with severe dementia who was admitted with urinary tract infection and subsequently developed respiratory failure. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU. Since extubation, she has been in poor mental status, only opening her eyes to voice but not following commands. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 147/72 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. She has crackles bilaterally on lung auscultation.

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, and elevated creatinine at 1.6 mg/dL. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for low potassium at 3.3 mEq/L. Imaging reveals pulmonary edema.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic anemia, dysphagia, chronic diastolic heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is well-controlled.

In the ICU, the patient is receiving several medications including furosemide, fluoxetine, MVI, calcium carbonate, aspirin, iron sulfate, heparin, synthroid, lopressor, and vancomycin. She is also on tube feeds and being monitored for potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she is planned to be transferred to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis, further deterioration in mental status, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with severe dementia and a history of urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia due to aspiration, and other medical conditions such as chronic anemia, dysphagia, chronic diastolic heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has been extubated since then. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 147/72 to 153/72 mmHg, heart rate between 85 and 108 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. She has a history of allergies to sulfa, erythromycin, and lactose intolerance. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Her renal function is within normal range, but there is evidence of electrolyte imbalances. The patient's imaging shows pulmonary edema.
