","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and severe 3V coronary artery disease (CAD). She experienced a cardiac arrest at a rehab facility and received four rounds of epinephrine. Upon transfer to the ICU, she was hemodynamically stable with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and not requiring any pressors. The patient had non-purposeful movements of her lower extremities, which may be secondary to ischemia. She also has a history of a previous STEMI and underwent cardiac catheterization with multivessel CAD treated with bare-metal stents (BMS) in the mid to distal left circumflex artery. Her ejection fraction (EF) is 40-45% on recent echocardiogram. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Instent thrombosis causing ischemia leading to arrhythmia: Given the patient's history of severe 3V CAD and previous STEMI, there is a concern for potential complications such as instent thrombosis, which can lead to ischemia and subsequent arrhythmias.
2. Neurological impairment: The patient's neurologic status is unclear due to the lack of information regarding her current level of consciousness and the recent CT scan showing slight ill-definition of grey-white junction. There is a possibility of neurological impairment, possibly related to the cardiac arrest or underlying"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and severe 3V coronary artery disease. She was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing cardiac arrest, for which she received four rounds of epinephrine. Upon arrival, the patient is currently hemodynamically stable with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and not requiring any pressors. However, she has diminished radial pulses and absent dorsal pedal pulses on both sides. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450-500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 30, HCO3- of 180, BE of -16, and SaO2 of 100%. Physical examination reveals pupillary dilation and minimal response to light, difficulty hearing heart sounds, and symmetrical chest expansion with resonant percussion notes. The patient's abdomen is soft but unable to assess, and there is no lower extremity edema. Neurological assessment is not possible due to sedation. Laboratory results indicate a blood glucose level of 209 mg/dL, lactic acid level of 1.3 mmol/L, and TCO2 of 20 and 22. Imaging shows left basilar atelectasis on chest X-ray and slight ill-definition of grey-white junction on preliminary CT head read. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient's plan includes an arctic sun cooling protocol, EEG, trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE), consultation with neurology, and further evaluation of the CT head read. Medications include fentanyl, midazolam, and regular insulin sliding scale. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can be prevented by maintaining good endotracheal suctioning and following proper antibiotic prophylaxis.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and decreased peripheral pulses increase the risk of DVT formation, which can potentially lead to a PE if clot fragments dislodge and travel to the lungs.
3. Hypoglycemia: Regular insulin sliding scale management may result in hypoglycemia if not properly monitored and adjusted.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The presence of LBBB on ECG and severe 3V CAD history increases the risk of future cardiac arrhythmias.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension.
- She was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing cardiac arrest.
- The patient has severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent (BMS) placement in the mid to distal left circumflex artery.
- She is currently hemodynamically stable with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and not requiring vasopressors.
- The patient has mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
- She is mildly volume overloaded and has evidence of focal hypokinesis in the inferolateral wall.
- The patient has been sedated and intubated in the ICU.
- She has been on rewarming therapy since midnight.
- The patient's neurologic status is of concern, as she opened her eyes and squeezed hands to command when sedation was lightened.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. In-stent thrombosis: Given the patient's history of severe CAD and recent PCI, there is a risk of in-stent thrombosis leading to ischemia and potential arrhythmias.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac arrest and history of CAD increase the risk of arrhythmias.
3. Acute congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of mild regional left vent"

   function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild concentric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. Mild regional left ventricular dysfunction c/w CAD.
   Elevated estimated filling pressures. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Mild
   to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.

   # S/P Cardiac Arrest:
   Currently hemodynamically stable.  Based on history, appears that
   patient PEA arrested for unclear reasons at Rehab facility and recieved
   4 rounds of Epinephine.  Strips from her arrest are not available.  The
   patient is stable hemodynamically with MAP > 60 and not requiring
   pressors.  The patient has severe 3V CAD that was being considered for
   CABG in the future after pt's spinal stenosis surgery.  Noted to
   squeeze hands to command yesterday evening when sedation was
   lightened.  Concern for in-stent thrombosis causing ischemia leading to
   arrhythmia. Started re-warming on Arctic sun protocol at midnight,
   after 24 horus of cooling.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, who was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing cardiac arrest. The patient has severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the mid to distal left circumflex artery. 

The patient's current condition in the ICU includes being hemodynamically stable with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and not requiring any vasopressors. She is sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's blood pressure has fluctuated throughout the day, ranging from 102/50 mmHg to 147/69 mmHg. 

The patient's neurological status is concerning, as she showed slow rhythm and low voltage on EEG while paralyzed. A head CT scan showed no evidence of hemorrhage but possibly decreased grey/white matter differentiation. An MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been recommended by neurology to assess for any ischemic changes in the brain. 

The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed multivessel CAD, for which she underwent balloon angioplasty with stent placement in the mid to distal L-circumflex artery. 

The patient is also being managed for"

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension. She was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a right internal jugular (RIJ) central line, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl), and administration of vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.8°F (38.2°C), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 78/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 77%, indicating potential tissue hypoxia.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished pulses in the right radial, left radial, right dorsalis pedis (DP), and left DP. The respiratory system examination is clear bilaterally with symmetric chest expansion and resonant percussion notes. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdominal examination is soft and bowel sounds are present. There are no lower extremity edemas noted.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.6 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 44 mg/dL, creatinine of 1."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension who was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient has been in the ICU and has received various treatments and interventions.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has an increased sputum production and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to a positive urine analysis at the outside hospital. Blood cultures are pending, indicating a possible ongoing infection.

2. Hypotension: The patient has had periods of hypotension, which may be related to the Arctic Sun protocol, decreased mean systemic vascular resistance (MS), recent hospitalization, or a concerning for infection.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient appears to have been intubated for protection and has a respiratory support with a ventilator. The RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) is 47, indicating some difficulty in weaning off the ventilator.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient had a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) with multivessel CAD (coronary artery disease) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of three bare-metal stents (BMS) in the mid to distal L (left) circumflex artery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, who was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing cardiac arrest. The patient has undergone resuscitation efforts and has been intubated for protection. She has also had a STEMI with multivessel coronary artery disease and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with the placement of three bare-metal stents in the mid to distal left circumflex artery. The patient's ejection fraction is 55%, and there is some focal hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest and previous unstable arrhythmia, there is a risk of developing recurrent arrhythmias.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction is mildly reduced at 55%, indicating some degree of heart dysfunction. This puts her at risk for developing heart failure.
4. Kidney Dysfunction: The patient's urine output has been low, and her creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient is currently intubated and may be at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension. She was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient underwent resuscitation efforts and was transferred to our hospital. She is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspicion of infection. Her vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated temperature. The patient has a history of multivessel coronary artery disease and has undergone stenting in the mid to distal left circumflex artery. An echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 55% with focal hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall.

The patient's peripheral pulses are diminished, and there is evidence of left lower lobe atelectasis on chest X-ray. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia and elevated white blood cell count.

Plan:

1. S/P Cardiac Arrest: The patient appeared to have pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest at the outside hospital. She received four rounds of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) before being transferred to our hospital. The etiology of the cardiac arrest may be secondary to in-stent thrombosis or unstable arrhythmia. The patient has undergone active cooling and has had periods of hypotension.

2. Respiratory Status: The patient seems to have been intubated for protective reasons. She"

   type II, hypertension, is transfered from outside hospital s/p cardiac
   arrest.
   24 Hour Events:
   - extubated yesterday
   - discontinued cefepime/CTX, on vanc/zosyn for GPC and aspiration
   - per family, patient had significant abdominal pain and bloating plus
   nausea just prior to discharge from SS to Rehab (and daughter feels
   they did not do anything about it at [**Hospital6 707**]); possible
   source of an infection or other process that caused PEA arrest?
   - sinus tachycardia - started metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 **] - concerned
   about beta blocker withdrawal. Gave 500cc to see if it would help sinus
   tachycardia (low CVP as well) and following patient developed
   respiratory distress (see below).
   - patient became tachycardic 150s, hypertensive SBP 200, respiratory
   distress/tachypneic RR 40s, wheezing. Gave 40mg IV lasix, 2mg IV
   morphine, nebs treatment, NTG drip, NIPPV, CXR, EKG. Improved with

   71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II,
   hypertension, is transfered from outside hospital s/p cardiac arrest
   s/p arctic sun protocol, since extubated, rewarmed
   # Respiratory status: appears to have been intubated for protection.
   Extubated yesterday and tolerated well during the day. Had episode of
   tachypnea, desaturation, tachycardia, hypertension. Likely acute
   pulmonary edema. Was given lasix, morphine, NTG drip. Eventually
   required NIPPV. No back on facetent and saturating well.
   - continue to wean oxygen as tolerated
   - day 3 vanc/flagyl
   - NIPPV as needed
   - incentive spirometry
   - out of bed to chair
   - follow up cultures
   -repeat CXR
   - diurese 500 cc
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Appears to have PEA arrest at OSH. 4 rounds of
   ACLS and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]. Squeezes hands to command. The etiology
   may be secondary to unstable arrhythmia. s/p Arctic Sun protocol.
   - appeciate neuro recs
   - consider d/cing heparin gtt - no evidence of in stent thrombosis
   - monitor on tele
   - PCI vs CABG when stable
   - beta blocker as tolerated
   # Hypertension: The patient appears to be hypertensive requiring more
   antihypertensives. At home she was on metoprolol, verapamil and
   lisinopril
   - metoprolol tartrate 25mg TID
   - captopril 6.25mg TID
   # Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to beta blocker
   withdrawal. Does not appear fluid down. Does not appear septic at this
   point. [**Month (only) 11**] have pneumonia? Fluid challenge did not help patient. [**Month (only) 11**]
   have some component of agitation.
   - uptitrate metoprolol tartrate
   - minimize agitation
   # CAD: s/p STEMI with cardiac cath with multivessel CAD s/p BMS x 3 to
   mid to distal L circumflex. TTE shows EF 55% with some focal
   hypokinesis of inferolateral wall which is consistent with priors. CVP

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and cardiac disease. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and underwent resuscitation efforts. The patient has been extubated but required reintubation due to respiratory distress, which was likely caused by acute pulmonary edema. She has been receiving various treatments including diuretics, NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation), and medications for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of unstable arrhythmias and previous cardiac arrest, which puts her at risk for further cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's recent episode of acute pulmonary edema and respiratory distress indicate a potential risk for recurrent respiratory issues.
3. Infection: The presence of yeast in her urine culture suggests a possible fungal infection, and the sputum culture revealed staphylococcus aureus, indicating a bacterial infection.
4. Diabetic complications: As a diabetic patient, she may be prone to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
5. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure requires ongoing management and may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events.

Note: This summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consider other factors and conduct further evaluations to determine the patient's current condition and future risks."

   type II, hypertension, is transfered from outside hospital s/p cardiac
   arrest.
   24 Hour Events:
   - extubated yesterday
   - discontinued cefepime/CTX, on vanc/zosyn for GPC and aspiration
   - per family, patient had significant abdominal pain and bloating plus
   nausea just prior to discharge from SS to Rehab (and daughter feels
   they did not do anything about it at [**Hospital6 707**]); possible
   source of an infection or other process that caused PEA arrest?
   - sinus tachycardia - started metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 **] - concerned
   about beta blocker withdrawal. Gave 500cc to see if it would help sinus
   tachycardia (low CVP as well) and following patient developed
   respiratory distress (see below).
   - patient became tachycardic 150s, hypertensive SBP 200, respiratory
   distress/tachypneic RR 40s, wheezing. Gave 40mg IV lasix, 2mg IV
   morphine, nebs treatment, NTG drip, NIPPV, CXR, EKG. Improved with

   71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II,
   hypertension, is transfered from outside hospital s/p cardiac arrest
   s/p arctic sun protocol, since extubated, rewarmed
   # Respiratory status: appears to have been intubated for protection.
   Extubated yesterday and tolerated well during the day. Had episode of
   tachypnea, desaturation, tachycardia, hypertension. Likely acute
   pulmonary edema. Was given lasix, morphine, NTG drip. Eventually
   required NIPPV. No back on facetent and saturating well.
   - continue to wean oxygen as tolerated
   - day 3 vanc/flagyl
   - NIPPV as needed
   - incentive spirometry
   - out of bed to chair
   - follow up cultures
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Appears to have PEA arrest at OSH. 4 rounds of
   ACLS and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]. Squeezes hands to command. The etiology
   may be secondary to unstable arrhythmia. s/p Arctic Sun protocol.
   - appeciate neuro recs
   - consider d/cing heparin gtt - no evidence of in stent thrombosis
   - monitor on tele
   - PCI vs CABG when stable
   - beta blocker as tolerated
   # Hypertension: The patient appears to be hypertensive requiring more
   antihypertensives. At home she was on metoprolol, verapamil and
   lisinopril
   - uptitrate beta blocker today
   - start ACEi as tolerated
   # Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to beta blocker
   withdrawal. Does not appear fluid down. Does not appear septic at this
   point. [**Month (only) 11**] have pneumonia? Fluid challenge did not help patient. [**Month (only) 11**]
   have some component of agitation.
   - uptitrate metoprolol tartrate
   - minimize agitation
   # CAD: s/p STEMI with cardiac cath with multivessel CAD s/p BMS x 3 to
   mid to distal L circumflex. TTE shows EF 55% with some focal
   hypokinesis of inferolateral wall which is consistent with priors. CVP
   low to normal.
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue plavix
   - Continue statin
   - beta blocker
   # DMII:
   - HISS - adjust prn
   # Nutrition:
   - speech and swallow eval

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and cardiac issues was transferred from another hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest.
- The patient was intubated and received treatment for acute pulmonary edema, which improved with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
- She has a past medical history of multivessel coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction.
- The patient's current vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and normal oxygen saturation.
- She has been extubated and is tolerating it well.
- Lab results indicate normal white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- Chest X-ray shows bilateral edema, indicating possible fluid accumulation in the lungs.
- The patient is currently on several medications including metoprolol, verapamil, lisinopril, heparin, famotidine, lorazepam, furosemide, and morphine.
- The plan includes continuing oxygen therapy, weaning off NIPPV, incentive spirometry, and out-of-bed chair exercises.
- The patient's cardiac status will be monitored, and a decision on further cardiac intervention (PCI or CABG) will be made when stable.
- Blood cultures are pending, and follow-up cultures are planned.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and cardiac disease. She was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest. Since being in the ICU, the patient has been extubated and tolerated well, but had an episode of respiratory distress due to acute pulmonary edema. She was given lasix, morphine, and NTG drip, and eventually required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient also has a history of multivessel coronary artery disease and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. Her left ventricular ejection fraction is 55%. The patient has been experiencing sinus tachycardia, which may be secondary to beta blocker withdrawal. Her blood glucose levels have been stable, and she is currently on insulin sliding scale. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is on multiple antihypertensive medications. She is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's current goals of care include discussing the future course of treatment with the family. She is NPO (nothing by mouth) for now, and a speech and swallow evaluation is pending. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced acute pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. She was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest and underwent resuscitation efforts, including the Arctic Sun protocol. The patient has been extubated and is currently on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) due to an episode of acute pulmonary edema. She is also receiving diuretics, antibiotics, and other medications for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's previous episode of acute pulmonary edema and current need for NIPPV indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is necessary.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient had an unstable arrhythmia leading to a cardiac arrest, and her sinus tachycardia may be related to beta-blocker withdrawal or another underlying condition. Continuous cardiac monitoring is required, and further evaluation for potential causes of arrhythmias should be conducted.

3. Infection: The positive MRSA sputum culture suggests a risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics should be administered, and regular follow-up cultures should be obtained.

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating fluid loss. Careful monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent dehydration or fluid overload.

5. Poor Glycemic Control: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus type II"

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension, who was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest. She has undergone resuscitation and rewarming, and has been successfully extubated. 

The patient's current respiratory status is stable on 3L O2 NC, but she continues to have a cough. She has a positive MRSA sputum culture, indicating pneumonia. Her chest X-ray shows improvement with smaller bilateral effusions compared to the previous day. She is being treated with antibiotics, and day 4 antibiotics have been started. 

The patient also experienced an episode of acute pulmonary edema requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. 

Regarding her cardiac status, the patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest of unknown etiology, which may be secondary to unstable arrhythmia or infection. She received four rounds of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) and was transferred to another hospital. She underwent the Arctic Sun protocol and is currently monitored on telemetry. A cardiac catheterization has been planned to evaluate for ischemic cause, particularly in the setting of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) history, and is likely to be performed on Monday. 

The patient's blood pressures are stable and low normal. She was previously on metoprolol, verapamil, and lisinopril at home, and her current medication includes metoprolol tartrate 25mg T"

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the progress note history and physical examination on
   [**2168-2-20**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8562**] noted above.  I was present during the
   pertinent portions of the physical examination today.   I concur with
   the diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan outlined above.
   Approximately 50% allocated time involved coordination of care.
   MEDICAL DECISION MAKING.  This 71year old woman with known CAD and a
   prior BMS to the left circumflex presented with an out-of-hospital
   PEA.   Her downtime was relatively brief and the [**Name (NI) 11096**] Sun protocol for
   cerebral protection was implemented.   She has made a marked recovery
   in her cognitive function.  There is no evidence of a recent MI by
   biomarkers.  She has not had recurrent chest pain.  She has been
   started on a beta blocker and will transition over to an ACE.
   ASSESSMENT:  3 Vessel Coronary Artery Disease with Prior BMS to the LCx
                                s/p PEA cardiac arrest
   PLAN:                     CCU monitoring for recurrent arrhytmias
                                   Cardiac catheterization Monday to

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an out-of-hospital pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and was transferred to the hospital where she received the Arctic Sun protocol for cerebral protection. She has made a marked recovery in her cognitive function and shows no evidence of a recent myocardial infarction (MI) by biomarkers. She has been started on a beta blocker and will transition over to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory status: The patient has a positive MRSA sputum culture, indicating pneumonia. She is being treated with antibiotics, and her CXR shows improved bilateral effusions compared to yesterday. She was successfully extubated two days ago but experienced acute pulmonary edema afterwards, requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. She is stable on 3 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula and continues to have a cough.
2. s/p PEA arrest: The etiology of the PEA arrest is unknown. The patient received four rounds of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) and was transferred to the hospital. The possible causes may include unstable arrhythmias or infection. She underwent the Arctic Sun protocol and is currently being monitored on telemetry.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and a recent cardiac arrest. She was transferred from an outside hospital and underwent the Arctic Sun protocol, but her exact condition before the cardiac arrest is unknown.
- The patient has been extubated and rewarmed successfully, but experienced acute pulmonary edema requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. She remains on 3L O2 NC and continues to have a cough.
- Her respiratory status is being monitored, and she is being weaned off oxygen as tolerated. Day 5 antibiotics are being continued, along with vancomycin for a 7-9 day course. She is also encouraged to use incentive spirometry and be out of bed to a chair.
- The patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest of unknown etiology, for which she received four rounds of ACLS and was transferred to another hospital. The cause of the arrest may be secondary to unstable arrhythmia or infection, and she underwent the Arctic Sun protocol.
- The patient's cardiac status is being closely monitored, and she is likely to undergo cardiac catheterization to evaluate for ischemic cause in the setting of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) history, possibly on Monday.
- The patient's blood pressures are stable and low normal, and she was previously on metoprolol, verapamil, and lisinopril. Her current medication"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension. She was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest and has since undergone rewarming and been extubated. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. She had an episode of acute pulmonary edema but is now stable on 3L O2 NC. The patient's previous medical history includes a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and a previous myocardial infarction (STEMI). She also has a history of unstable arrhythmia and possible infection as the etiology of her pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although her blood pressure is on the lower end of normal. She is experiencing sinus tachycardia, possibly due to anxiety or pain from her right leg. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with smaller bilateral pleural effusions and clear lungs on chest X-ray. She is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and is expected to continue weaning off oxygen as tolerated. The patient's cardiac function is good, with an ejection fraction of 55%. She has focal hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall, consistent with prior PCI. The patient's glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, who was transferred from an outside hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest. She underwent the Arctic Sun protocol and has since been extubated and rewarmed. The patient's current condition includes respiratory status improvement, with smaller bilateral pleural effusions and clear lungs on CXR. However, she still has a cough and is being treated for MRSA pneumonia. The patient also had an episode of acute pulmonary edema requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. She is stable on 3L O2 NC this morning.

The patient's medical history includes a previous PEA arrest of unknown etiology, with possible causes including unstable arrhythmia or infection. She underwent rounds of ACLS and the Arctic Sun protocol. Further evaluation is planned, including cardiac catheterization to assess for ischemic cause, likely to be done on Monday.

Other conditions include hypertension, with stable blood pressures and current medications including metoprolol, verapamil, and lisinopril. Sinus tachycardia is present, but the exact cause is unclear. Pain from the right leg may be a contributing factor, and efforts will be made to minimize agitation and provide pain control.

The patient also has a history of multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD), with previous STEMI and stenting of the mid to distal L circumflex artery. Her left ventricular ejection fraction ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and has since been extubated. The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia caused by MRSA and has shown improvement on chest X-ray. She is stable on 3L O2 NC but continues to have a cough. The plan is to continue weaning oxygen as tolerated, start day 5 antibiotics, continue Vancomycin for a 7-9 day course, discontinue ceftriaxone and flagyl, encourage incentive spirometry, and out-of-bed chair activities. 

The patient also experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest of unknown etiology and underwent the Arctic Sun protocol. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, with a possible cardiac catheterization scheduled for Monday to evaluate for ischemic cause in the setting of significant CAD history. 

The patient's blood pressure is stable and low normal, and she was previously on metoprolol, verapamil, and lisinopril. The current plan is to continue metoprolol tartrate 25mg TID and lisinopril. 

Sinus tachycardia is present, but the etiology is unclear. It may be secondary to beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety, or pain from the right leg. The plan is to uptit"

   Assessment and Plan
   71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II,
   hypertension, is transfered from outside hospital s/p cardiac arrest
   s/p arctic sun protocol, since extubated, rewarmed.
   # Respiratory status:
   MRSA sputum culture positive, being treated for pneumonia. CXR
   improved, bilateral effusions smaller than yesterday and rest of lungs
   clear.  Extubated succesfully two days ago with an episode of acute
   pulmonary edema afterwards requiring non-invasive positive pressure
   ventilation.  Stable on 3L O2 NC this AM.  Continues to have cough.
   - continue to wean oxygen as tolerated
   - day 6 antibiotics ; continue Vancomycin for [**7-9**] day course ; DCed
   ceftriaxone and flagyl
   - incentive spirometry
   - out of bed to chair
   - follow up cultures
   - try for net even fluid status today.
   # s/p PEA arrest:
   PEA arrest of unknown etiology. 4 rounds of ACLS and transferred to
   [**Hospital1 1**].  The etiology may be secondary to unstable arrhythmia or
   infection. s/p Arctic Sun protocol.
   - monitor on tele
   - Cardiac Catheterization to evaluate for ischemic cause in setting of
   significant CAD history today.
   - beta blocker as tolerated
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable, low normal.  At home she was on metoprolol,
   verapamil and lisinopril.
   - metoprolol tartrate 25mg TID
   - lisinopril
   # Sinus tachycardia:
   Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to beta blocker withdrawal. Does not
   appear fluid down. Does not appear septic anymore.  [**Month (only) 11**] be associated
   with anxiety or pain from right leg.
   - uptitrate metoprolol tartrate
   - minimize agitation
   - pain control
   # CAD: s/p STEMI with cardiac cath with multivessel CAD s/p BMS x 3 to
   mid to distal L circumflex in past. TTE shows EF 55% with some focal
   hypokinesis of inferolateral wall which is consistent with priors. CVP
   low to normal.
   -          Continue ASA, plavix, statin, beta blocker
   -
   # DMII:
   - HISS - adjust prn
   # Nutrition:
   - speech and swallow eval recommended ground solids and nectar
   prethickened liquids

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and underwent resuscitation with the Arctic Sun protocol. The patient has been successfully extubated but had an episode of acute pulmonary edema requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. She is currently stable on 3L O2 via nasal cannula and continues to have a cough.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory status: MRSA sputum culture positive, being treated for pneumonia. The chest X-ray (CXR) shows improvement with smaller bilateral pleural effusions and clear lungs except for increased density at the left base consistent with atelectasis or consolidation. The patient is being weaned off oxygen as tolerated and will continue with day 6 antibiotics. Incentive spirometry and out-of-bed chair exercises are recommended.

2. Post-cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest of unknown etiology. She received four rounds of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) and was transferred to another hospital. The etiology of the arrest may be secondary to unstable arrhythmia or infection. The patient underwent the Arctic Sun protocol and is currently being monitored on telemetry. A cardiac catheterization will be performed today to evaluate for ischemic cause in the setting of significant CAD history."
