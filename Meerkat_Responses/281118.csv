   CXR findings, opacification of the L.lung(effusion vs.collapse),
   R.lung with patchy airspace opacity. CT findings of ground glass
   opacities in both lungs suggesting atypical pneumonia. Per CT read,
   other possibilites include drug rxn, pulm hemorrhage. However, given
   fever infection more likely. In terms of sources of infection,
   considerations include bacterial, viral such as influenza, or less
   likely fungal PCP (however LDH elevated)-given immunosuppression MS tx.
   Other less likely possibilies include fluid overload from cardiac
   causes (however last echo with perserved function, BNP 1300).
   Malignancy also a possibility. Given history of asthma and MS will have
   to be mindful of pt's respiratory status. PE also in differential,

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain. She presents with shortness of breath, cough, and fever after falling. Upon admission, she is experiencing respiratory distress and confusion. Imaging findings indicate opacification of the left lung, suggesting possible infection or effusion, as well as patchy airspace opacity in both lungs suggestive of atypical pneumonia. Other possibilities include drug reaction, pulmonary hemorrhage, or malignancy.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to infection, given the CT and CXR findings.
2. Altered Mental Status (not delirium): The patient appears delirious, with unclear baseline mental status. Possible causes include infection, narcotic intake (although negative for toxicity), and metabolic issues. Neuro consult has been requested.
3. Fall: The patient had a fall, but the symptoms following the fall are not clear. Possibilities include syncope from vasovagal, orthostatic, or cardiac causes, as well as neurological causes like seizures or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
4. Multiple Sclerosis: The patient has advanced MS, with symptoms including unsteady gait, dizziness, eye pain, and sleep disturbances. Neurology has been notified, and recommendations for medication management have been provided.
5. Chronic Pain: The patient's chronic pain management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain who presented with shortness of breath, cough, and fever after a fall. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, altered mental status, and potential complications from her underlying conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to bacterial pneumonia, as evidenced by the opacification of the left lung on imaging. Given her asthma and neuromuscular dysfunction related to MS, there is a low threshold for intubation.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient appears delirious, and it is unclear about her baseline mental status. Possible causes include infection, MS exacerbation, or toxic/metabolic factors. A neurology consult has been requested to evaluate and manage her altered mental status.

3. Chronic Pain: The patient is on multiple medications for chronic pain management, including baclofen, oxycontin, celexa, and lamictal. These medications should be continued or adjusted as per neurology recommendations.

4. Eye Abrasion: The patient has an eye abrasion that requires wound care. An ophthalmology consult may be necessary if there are any visual changes.

5. Depression: The patient is on celexa for depression, and this medication should be continued.

6. Nutrition: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) until her"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   53 yr old MS, asthma, chronic pain, presented with symptoms of fever,
   hypoxia, cough, sputum, altered mental status. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   severe pneumonia. CT chest yesterday.
   Overnight, destaurated rapidly when mask taken off, confused,
   hallucinations.
   Exam notable for Tm 100.3 BP 133/95, HR 101 with sat 91% on O2 by nc.
   HEENT laceration on left eyelid, Lungs decreased breath sounds with
   fine crackles and insp wheezes, CVS r/r/r, no murmurs, abdomen soft,
   NT, nondistended.
   Labs notable for WBC 6.0, K 3.7, HCT 31.9 , HCO3 20, Cr 0.8.
   CT chest reviewed with team. Extensive GG changes LLL, RUL, LUL
   Impression/plan
 agree with plan above. For hypoxemic acute
   respiratory failure due to pneumonia, probably atypical, will continue
   treatment with vanc/levofloxacin (renally dosed). Chest PT prn. PCP
   remains possible. If decompensates, will intubate and add
   Bactrim/steroids and would consider dose of Lasix. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above. Will continue treatment for MS.
   Next of [**Doctor First Name **] is husband. Full code. Patient is critically ill. Total
   time: 40 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain. She presented with symptoms of fever, cough, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She was admitted to the hospital for severe pneumonia and subsequently developed respiratory failure and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.3 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 91/68 mmHg to 133/95 mmHg, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The physical examination findings include obesity, mild respiratory distress, confusion, lethargy, bilateral anterior chest exam with diffuse rhonchi in the left lung, and chronic venous status changes. The neurologic examination shows intermittent twitching without tremor.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 136 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, troponin-T level below 0.01, TCO2 level of 22, glucose level of 92 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.4 mmol/L.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain.
- She presented with shortness of breath, cough, and fever after a fall.
- The patient has respiratory failure, altered mental status, and neuromuscular dysfunction.
- Her respiratory distress is likely due to infection, as indicated by CT and CXR findings.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started, and follow-up cultures were ordered.
- The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 91%) and abnormal ABG values indicate respiratory compromise.
- She is receiving aggressive chest physiotherapy, nebulizers as needed, and is being considered for intubation.
- The patient's confusion and hallucinations may be due to infection, MS exacerbation, or a metabolic cause.
- A neurology consult was requested to assess her mental status.
- The patient's baseline mental status is unclear, so further evaluation is needed.
- She has a history of falls, and it is unclear if the recent fall was associated with syncope or any pre/post symptoms.
- Orthostatic measures and IV fluids were initiated.
- The patient's MS medications, including amantadine, baclofen, carisoprodol, and betaseron, were discussed with the neurologist.

   #SOB/respiratory distress: Likely a result of infection given CT and
   CXR findings, opacification of the L.lung(effusion vs.collapse),
   R.lung with patchy airspace opacity. Respiratory viral antigen assay
   negative.  Most likely bacterial pneumonia in the setting of
   neuromuscular dysfunction.
   -broad spectrum abx at this time.
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   -sating ok now when patient keeps mask on, however given asthma and MS
   will have low threshold to intubate.
   - Aggressive chest PT
   -nebs prn
   -consider further imaging or thoracentesis for further dx
   -serial CXR.
   .
   #s/p fall: unknown if fall with any pre/post symptoms to suggest
   syncope from vasovagal, orthostatic, or cardiac cause. Other
   possibilies include neurologic such as seizure or TIA. Other
   possibilities include mechanical from underlying MS/sleep disturbance.
   -orthostatics when more stable
   -IVF.

   #MS-pt with h.o MS,per last neuro note, has unsteady gait, dizziness,
   eye pain, and sleep disturbances including sleep walking. PER ED note,
   Pt with advanced MS. Unclear of pt's baseline mental status will have
   to confirm with neuro.
   -notify neuro of pt's admission, recs:
   -continue amantidine, baclofen, carisoprodolo for now. Will d/w neuro

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain. She presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fever following a fall. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to an infection, as suggested by the opacification of the left lung on the chest X-ray, which could indicate pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further diagnostic tests such as blood, urine, and sputum cultures are planned. The patient's asthma and MS increase the risk of respiratory failure, so close monitoring and a low threshold for intubation are recommended.

The patient's altered mental status may be caused by various factors including infection, MS exacerbation, or metabolic issues. A neurology consultation is requested to evaluate the patient's baseline mental status and determine the appropriate course of action.

The patient has a history of MS, which is characterized by symptoms such as unsteady gait, dizziness, eye pain, and sleep disturbances. The patient's admission to the ICU may require adjustments to her current medications, including amantadine, baclofen, carisoprodol, and potentially betaseron.

The patient also has chronic pain, for which certain medications are being held or continued at this time.

An eye abrasion is noted, and wound care is recommended. If there"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fever after a fall. She is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory distress, likely caused by atypical pneumonia. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for both MRSA and atypical pneumonia coverage. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 126/77 to 152/93 mmHg, heart rate between 92 and 104 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. She is on high-flow oxygen and has wheezing in her chest. The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels. Her renal function appears to be normal. The patient's mental status has fluctuated, but she is currently alert and oriented. Other ongoing concerns include her recent eye abrasion, fall, and chronic pain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and intervention, such as non-invasive ventilation or intubation, should be considered to maintain adequate gas exchange.
2. Infection: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest an atypical pneumonia. It is important to continue monitoring her vital"

   cough, sputum, altered MS. Admitted with pneumonia. Remains tenuous but
   with decreased FiO2 requirements. She is currently complaining of
   shortness of breath with slightly  more labored breathing. Will do
   trial of NPPV (BiPAP) mostly to decrease work of breathing. Continue
   same Abx for atypical pneumonia. D/c diamox. If she accutely worsens
   will likely intubate and broaden coverage for PCP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a medical history of multiple sclerosis, asthma, and chronic pain. She presented with fever, hypoxia, cough, sputum, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted with pneumonia and remains in a tenuous condition but with decreased FiO2 requirements. 

The patient is currently experiencing shortness of breath with slightly more labored breathing. A trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) or BiPAP will be done to decrease the work of breathing. The same antibiotics for atypical pneumonia will continue, and Diamox will be discontinued. If the patient acutely worsens, she may need intubation and broader coverage for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), altered mental status (not delirium), and the possibility of worsening and requiring intubation. Additionally, the patient has a history of asthma and chronic pain, which may further contribute to respiratory issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic pain, and depression. She was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and altered mental status. She has a history of falls and may have sustained an injury during her recent fall. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to a likely atypical pneumonia, and she is being treated with antibiotics for both MRSA and Gram-negative bacteria.

The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to her distress and inability to tolerate BiPAP. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but her oxygen saturation remains low at 93%. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, suggesting an ongoing infection or hypoperfusion. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's altered mental status has cleared overnight, and she is now oriented to time, place, and person. She remains sedated and unable to provide a history. Her neurological exam is not assessed due to sedation.

The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates, consistent with pneumonia. She is receiving aggressive chest physiotherapy, nebulizer treatments as needed, and her fluid balance is being closely monitored.

The patient's chronic pain and depression symptoms are stable, and she is being treated with Tylenol and ibuprofen for pain management, as well as citalopram for depression. Her multiple sclerosis symptoms remain stable, and she is currently on amantadine"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient's symptoms began with shortness of breath, cough, and fever after a fall.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and administration of different medications such as methylprednisolone, fentanyl, midazolam (versed), propofol, heparin, and antibiotics.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Infection: The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

3. Multiple sclerosis exacerbation: The patient's MS symptoms appear to be stable, but there is a risk of MS exacerbation due to the current illness and treatment interventions.

4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status could be related to her underlying MS or a complication of the illness. Monitoring for neurological changes is essential.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU."

   Patient with fairly acute worsening of respiratory status last night
   for unclear reasons. Patient described as being very wheezy with
   moderate secretions; now has clear lung fields, the difference between
   peak and plateau pressures is only 3-4 cm H2O indicating  normal airway
   resistance. [**Month (only) 11**] have had mucus plug; alternatively may have had acute
   pulmonary edema due to ischemia. Acute pulmonary embolism would be
   another consideration. Although she has undelrying asthma, the acute
   change in the hospital and the rapid improvement seems unusual for
   asthma. I would check a BNP, again assess for ischemia, and consider
   CTA both to assess for worsening infiltrates and to exclude pulmonary
   embolism. Patient on high dose steroids; we can begin a taper today.
   Would reduce sedation today and switch to PSV; some of agitation
   yesterday on vent may have reflected the fact that we were not giving
   her the tidal volume or inspiratory flow that she wanted.
   Patient continues on broad spectrum antibiotics. New sputum cultures
   sent.
   Patient with mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis; metabolic
   acidosis probably reflects effect of diamox. Would stop that medication
   since it wil interfere with our ability to extubate her.
   Hct stable. No evidence of bleeding. Not at transfusion threshold.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions including respiratory distress, asthma, multiple sclerosis, and pneumonia. They were admitted to the ICU due to worsening respiratory status, and various interventions have been attempted to stabilize their condition.

Key Points:
- The patient pulled off their oxygen last night and exhibited increased work of breathing.
- They were given Ativan and morphine and placed on BiPAP, but tachypnea persisted.
- An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed minimal changes.
- The patient was subsequently intubated and given large amounts of sedation.
- They became very bronchospastic, and IV steroids were administered.
- The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, although there is a slight decrease in blood pressure.
- The patient's oxygen saturation remains stable at 97%.
- The ABG results indicate a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
- Chest X-ray shows diffuse alveolar infiltrates, which suggest pneumonia.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating an infection or inflammatory response.
- The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels are within normal limits, ruling out acute coronary syndrome.
- The patient's renal function is normal.
- The patient has a history of asthma, multiple sclerosis, and anemia.
- The patient is currently on high-dose steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fever after a fall. The patient's troponin levels were positive, indicating possible cardiac involvement. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, which did not show a pulmonary embolism (PE) but revealed multilobar pneumonia (PNA). The patient has been on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin antibiotics.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She has shown signs of respiratory distress and has required increased sedation to manage her agitation. Blood, sputum, and urine cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism for her pneumonia. The patient's white blood cell count has been monitored, and her fever curve is being trended.

The patient also has an altered mental status, which was present prior to intubation and has worsened since. Neurological consultation has been sought, and propofol has been used for sedation. The patient's MS symptoms are stable, and her home medications have been restarted.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has multilobar pneumonia, which may lead to worsening respiratory function and increased risk of sepsis.
2. Acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including multiple sclerosis, asthma, and chronic pain. She presented with shortness of breath, cough, and fever after a fall and was found to have pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress. She is also experiencing altered mental status and is sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation of cough, fever, and shortness of breath suggests pneumonia. Given the worsening condition, it is important to consider the possibility of resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas, and broad-spectrum antibiotics like Zosyn have been added to the treatment regimen.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress has necessitated mechanical ventilation. Monitoring her respiratory status and ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation are crucial. Regular assessment of ABG values and respiratory mechanics will guide ventilator management.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's positive troponin indicates myocardial injury, which may suggest underlying CAD. Further evaluation with cardiac enzymes and imaging studies such as a coronary CT angiography (CTA) is warranted to assess the extent of coronary artery disease.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's minimal responsiveness could be attributed to several factors including sedation, infection, or complications of multiple sclerosis. Close monitoring of neurological status and appropriate management are essential.
5. Fall Risk: As the patient remains"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, asthma, and multiple sclerosis. They are currently intubated and on ventilator support with good oxygenation on 40% oxygen. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, pneumonia, and altered mental status. Physical examination findings include stable vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, troponin T levels, and lactic acid levels, along with other abnormal values. Imaging reveals extensive bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia and evidence of tracheomalacia. The patient is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further consultations have been made for tracheal stent, alternative sedation agents, and potential cardiac evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's imaging shows extensive bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, indicating a possible infectious complication.
2. Tracheomalacia: Evidence of tracheomalacia may make it difficult for the patient to clear secretions, increasing the risk of further respiratory complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is currently being managed with mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if not adequately supported.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's medical history includes CAD, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

","Summary:
- 53-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including MS, asthma, and chronic pain, presenting with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fever following a fall.
- Radiographic findings indicate atypical pneumonia, and the patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia.
- The patient's respiratory distress worsened when transitioning from assisted ventilation to spontaneous ventilation, leading to increased discomfort and agitation.
- She is currently receiving antibiotics (Vanco/zosyn/levo), sedation, and mechanical ventilation.
- Further plans include obtaining sputum, blood, and urine cultures, continuing current antibiotics, weaning off propofol, aggressive chest physiotherapy, nebulizers as needed, and serial chest X-rays.
- The patient also has altered mental status, likely related to infection, and is minimally responsive on propofol.
- Monitoring of neurologic exam, consideration of haloperidol for agitation, and consultation with neurology for further evaluation and treatment are planned.
- The patient has a history of multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, and depression.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the presence of pneumonia increase the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and respiratory support is crucial.
2. Infection: The patient has pneumonia and altered mental status, which can be associated with infections. Regular monitoring of vital signs, fever curve, and follow-up cultures will help in managing and preventing further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fever following a fall. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and placed on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress. She has tracheomalacia and atypical pneumonia, and her condition has been unstable with fluctuations in mental status and discomfort when attempts were made to wean her off sedation. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, sedation, and other medications for her various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of her ventilation parameters are essential.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular monitoring of sputum, blood, and urine cultures, along with aggressive chest physiotherapy, is crucial to prevent and detect VAP early.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. The use of compression boots and other prophylactic measures is important to prevent DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients, especially those on mechanical ventilation, are at increased risk of developing stress ulcers. Prophylactic use of H2 blockers helps prevent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a medical history of multiple sclerosis, asthma, and chronic pain. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fever following a fall. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory distress. The patient has been transitioned from assisted ventilation (AC) to pressure support (PS) mode on the ventilator, which resulted in increased discomfort and agitation. Her current medications include piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and propofol for sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress indicates a potential risk for respiratory failure due to the underlying pneumonia and compromised lung function.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adherence to proper ventilator care practices are crucial in preventing this complication.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of DVT. The patient is wearing boots for prophylaxis, but regular assessment and monitoring for signs of DVT are necessary.

4. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients, like the patient in this case, are at risk of developing stress ulcers. Prophylactic H2 blocker medication has been initiated to reduce this risk"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis, asthma, and chronic pain.
- She presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fever after a fall.
- She was diagnosed with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, likely due to an atypical pneumonia.
- The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
- She is currently on several medications including piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, fentanyl, propofol, heparin sodium, and famotidine.
- The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but she has abnormal laboratory results including elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and lactic acid levels.
- The patient also has altered mental status and is being monitored closely.
- She has a history of depression and chronic pain, and her symptoms are being managed accordingly.
- The patient is receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding and is being closely monitored for any complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's acute respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation, she is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there is a possibility of secondary infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or urinary tract infection.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, asthma, and pneumonia. The patient was on pressure support ventilation (PSV) through much of the night and subsequently required more propofol, resulting in a decreased respiratory rate and being switched back to assist control. Oxygenation has been good, but agitation remains a problem.

The patient's 24-hour events indicate that they are unable to provide a history due to encephalopathy and intubation. Allergies are not reported. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin (2134-10-4) at 04:00 PM, Levofloxacin (2134-10-5) at 10:00 PM, Vancomycin (2134-10-6) at 08:00 AM, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) (2134-10-6) at 08:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other ICU medications include famotidine (Pepcid), colace, baclofen, chlorhexidine, atrovent, albuterol, and beta [Doctor Last Name 2143]. The patient is also on chronic narcotics at home and will continue to need some narcotics.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.9°C (98.5°F), current temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate (HR) of 66 bpm with a range of 62-85 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 65/40 mmHg to 132/75 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute with a range of 8-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,102 mL and output of 2,757 mL since midnight, with a current weight of 102 kg. The patient's urine output is 2,757 mL, and the NG output is 345 mL. The patient's blood products include a total output of 2,757 mL and 1,460 mL since admission.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on an endotracheal tube and assisted control mode ventilation (ACMV) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 30. The patient's plateau pressure is 25 cmH2O, and compliance is 25 cmH2O/mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fever after a fall. She was found to have pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, for which she was admitted to the ICU. She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. Her vital signs are stable, but she has altered mental status and is mildly agitated. She also has a history of depression and is on citalopram. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with plans to continue current treatments and perform further tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure if not properly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress, which could progress to respiratory failure if her oxygenation or ventilation parameters worsen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including multiple sclerosis, asthma, and chronic pain. She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of acute respiratory distress, likely due to pneumonia. The patient underwent intubation but is now extubated. She experienced agitation after extubation, which was treated with morphine and ativan. The patient is currently on various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, morphine, and haloperidol.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for suspected pneumonia. It is important to monitor her response to the antibiotics and perform follow-up sputum, blood, and urine cultures to ensure effective treatment.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been extubated, there is a risk of respiratory failure due to her underlying condition and previous respiratory distress. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is essential.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and hallucinations may indicate delirium. Agitation should be managed with appropriate medications such as haloperidol while monitoring for any worsening neurological symptoms.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility. Prophylactic measures such as wearing boots should be implemented to reduce this risk.
5. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can increase the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and chronic pain. She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fever following a fall. The initial assessment suggests pneumonia, possibly atypical, along with acute respiratory failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), and altered mental status. The patient is currently extubated but experienced agitation after extubation, which was treated with morphine and Ativan. She is also hallucinating and using a high dose of Oxycontin, equivalent to 1.6 mg/hr of morphine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/76 mmHg to 160/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range. Her fluid balance shows a negative balance of -869 mL. The patient's blood work indicates elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. She has elevated levels of lactate acid and lactic acid, as well as slightly decreased albumin and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain medication. The plan moving forward includes continuing the current antibiotic regimen, monitoring the patient's mental status and respiratory function, and considering additional interventions such as Nebulizer treatments and Haloperidol"

","The patient is a 53-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including multiple sclerosis, asthma, and chronic pain. She presents with symptoms of acute respiratory distress and fever following a fall. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam), sedatives (likely for mechanical ventilation), and pain management with morphine.

The vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.5 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 123/72 mmHg to 111/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's current weight is 102 kg, and her height is 60 inches.

The physical examination reveals fine crackles throughout the lungs, soft and non-distended abdomen with positive bowel sounds, and no edema or peripheral pulses. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), and various electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia (Na+), hyperkalemia (K+), and hypocalcemia (Ca++). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's imaging studies show radiographic findings consistent with atypical pneumonia. The assessment and plan include treating the suspected atypical pneumonia with antibiotics,"
