   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   This is a 79 y.o. w/ h.o. HTN, s/p L THR for chronic L hip pain p/w GI
   bleed s/p 4u PRBC.
   .
   ##. GI Bleed: s/p 9 units and 2 units FFP.  Will undergo a EGD this AM
   for possible correctable lesion.  Differential includes ulcer disease
   (peptic versus NSAID induced), Diefaloy lesion, AVM. Per rehab note it
   is unclear if pt received NSAIDs in the hospital however it appears he
   has not had NSAIDs during his rehab stay. Pt may have stress ulcer
   given his recent hospital course of surgery and intubation, peptic
   ulcer disease also a consideration. Dieulafoy's lesion versus AVM is
   also a consideration that may have been exacerbated with his Coumadin
   medication and ASA. Lower GIB also on ddx.  NG lavage currently
   negative.  He is off pressors.
   - crossmatch for 6 units, will transfuse 3 units for goal Hct >30
   - will check q4hr Hcts following transfusions
   - will bolus and start Pantoprazole gtt
   - will continue active type and screen
   - will monitor CVP and UOP for goal of 15 and >30cc/hr respectively
   - if EGD unsuccessful, angiography
   - surgery aware
   - will keep INR goal <1.5.
   .
   ##. Abdominal Pain: Pt also noted abdominal pain that is diffuse that
   started last night. Pt had constipation from ileus with a progressive
   leukocytosis of 16 to 33. Pt denies any fevers with a soft but tender
   abdomen. KUB and CT abdomen r/o perforation.
   - continue to monitor abdominal exam
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   - will keep NPO
   .
   ##. Leukocytosis: Pt noted to have a leukocytosis that has progressed
   from 16 2 days ago to 20 and the 33. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to abdominal pain
   which will undergo assessment with CT scan. CT abdomen shows no free
   air or free fluid.  Pt currently afebrile, CXR shows no PNA. Other
   causes to consider include possible prosthesis infection though current
   examination showed no gross signs of infection. Pt could also become
   bacteremic during GI bld however it is lower on the differential.
   - trend WBC
   - plain film of hip in the AM
   - will pan culture
   - obtain outside hospital records
   .
   ##. Decreased urine ouput: Pt noted to have very low urine ouput over
   past few hours. Pt on arrival noted to be hypotensive with SBP in the
   60s, decreased UOP appears prerenal.  Creatinine check WNL will
   continue to trend though. Will monitor UOP response to IVF and blood
   transfusion.
   - trend Creatinine
   - monitor UOP for goal >30cc/hr
   .
   ##. s/p Left THR: Pt underwent recent L THR, as mentioned above
   leukocytosis may be from possible hip infection. Current exam showed no
   gross signs of infection.
   - check plain film in the AM of hip to eval for any evidence of
   erosions
   - keep on bed rest and pneumoboots
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt usually take Lisinopril as outpt for HTN, will hold off as
   pt is GI bleed.
   - will resume Lisinopril once GI bleed resolves
   .
   ##. FEN: Will continue with IVF until blood products arrive, replete
   electrolytes, NPO
   .
   ##. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, on PPI gtt for bleed
   .
   ##. Access: 1 PIV, Left IJ

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who underwent left total hip replacement surgery and is currently in the ICU for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been scheduled for this morning to identify a possible correctable lesion. The differential diagnosis includes peptic ulcer disease, NSAID-induced ulcer, Dieulafoy's lesion, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and lower GI bleeding. The patient is currently on pantoprazole and NPO status. The patient's abdominal pain, which started last night, is diffuse and associated with constipation from ileus. There is progressive leukocytosis from 16 to 33. The abdomen is soft but tender, and imaging studies including KUB and CT abdomen have ruled out perforation. The patient's urine output has decreased, which may be pre-renal due to hypotension and recent blood transfusion. The creatinine level is within normal limits. The patient's recent left total hip replacement may be related to leukocytosis, although the current examination shows no gross signs of infection. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and a plain film of the hip will be evaluated in the morning. The patient's hypertension is currently managed with held lisinopril."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who underwent left total hip replacement surgery and is currently in the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 9 units of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma transfusion. He has been on pantoprazole and morphine for pain management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 114/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's abdominal pain started last night and is diffuse. He has leukocytosis progressing from 16 to 33. The CT abdomen shows no free air or free fluid, ruling out perforation. The patient's urine output has decreased over the past few hours, appearing prerenal. The patient's recent medical history includes chronic left hip pain, for which he underwent THR, and he is currently on Coumadin and ASA. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased urine output due to hypovolemia.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient's diffuse abdominal pain may indicate a possible intra-abdominal pathology, such as an embolic event or intestinal ischemia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could be"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo. w/ ho HTN, s/p L THR for chronic L hip pain p/w GI
   bleed s/p 4u PRBC.
   # GIB:  Patient is s/p EGD revealing bleeding ulcer in the duodenal
   bulb which was subsequently clipped and injected.  Initially, HCT did
   not bump appropriately with transfusions; however, HCT has remained
   stable overnight.  Additional non-bleeding ulcerations were noted in
   the duodenal bulb.  Patient did report history of substantial NSAID use
   in setting of hip pain 1 month prior to surgery.  Additional etiologies
   may include H. Pylori and ZES.
   - continue to follow with QID HCT
s, maintaining active type and screen
   and transfusing to goal HCT > 29
   - d/w GI need for repeat EGD in setting of stable HCT
   - continue pantoprazole gtt
   - consider testing for H. Pylori IgG / IgM
   - consider checking gastrin level for ZES
   #. Abdominal Pain: patient initially noted diffused abdominal pain,
   likely cramping related blood induced diarrhea.  Abdominal imaging was
   unremarkable.  Patient did have progressive leukocytosis from 16 to 33
   now to 22.3.   Patient has remained afebrile and suspicion for
   infection is low.  Believe this likely represents demargination from
   systemic inflammatory response.
   - keep NPO
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   - serial exams
   ##. Leukocytosis:  patient continues to remain afebrile with
   substantial but downward trending leukocytosis.  Patient is s/p hip
   arthroplasty and infection of the prosthesis should be considered;
   however, exam is not concerning for infection
   - f/u pan cultures
   - consider hip XR this afternoon with orthopedics consult to evaluate
   hip
   ##. HTN: holding Lisinopril in setting of GI bleed and hypotension at
   presentation.
   ##. FEN: daily electrolytes with PRN repletion, NPO
   ##. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, on PPI gtt for bleed
   ##. Access: 1 PIV, Left IJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male who underwent left total hip arthroplasty and was admitted with severe gastrointestinal bleeding. He required activation of the massive transfusion protocol and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with attempted clipping of the bleeding vessel. The patient has stable hematocrit (HCT) levels and has received a total of 15 packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 5 fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 platelet, and 1 cryoprecipitate. He is currently on pantoprazole continuous infusion and morphine sulfate for pain control. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/40-152/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Re-bleeding: There is a possibility of re-bleeding from the duodenal ulcer, especially since additional non-bleeding ulcerations were noted during the EGD.

2. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and recent surgery, there is a risk of developing surgical site infection or other types of infections.

3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products, which may lead to fluid overload and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic left hip pain. He underwent left total hip arthroplasty (THR) and was admitted with severe gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring activation of the massive transfusion protocol. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, revealing a bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb which was subsequently clipped and injected. The patient received 15 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 unit of platelets, and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) initially did not bump appropriately with transfusions, but has remained stable overnight. Additional non-bleeding ulcerations were noted in the duodenal bulb. The patient reported a history of substantial nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use one month prior to surgery, and other possible etiologies include Helicobacter pylori infection and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES).

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate ranging from 67 to 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/40 to 152/58 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 12 to 47 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99"

The patient required activation of the massive transfusion protocol and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with attempted clipping of the bleeding vessel. Hemostasis was achieved using epinephrine injection and clips. The patient received a total of 15 packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 5 fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 platelet transfusion, and 1 cryoprecipitate transfusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo. w/ ho HTN, s/p L THR for chronic L hip pain p/w GI
   bleed s/p 4u PRBC.
   # GIB:  Patient is s/p EGD revealing bleeding ulcer in the duodenal
   bulb which was subsequently clipped and injected.  Initially, HCT did
   not bump appropriately with transfusions; however, HCT has remained
   stable overnight.  Additional non-bleeding ulcerations were noted in
   the duodenal bulb.  Patient did report history of substantial NSAID use
   in setting of hip pain 1 month prior to surgery.  Additional etiologies
   may include H. Pylori and ZES.
   - continue to follow with TID HCT
s, maintaining active type and screen
   and transfusing to goal HCT > 29
   - d/w GI need for repeat EGD in setting of stable HCT
   - continue pantoprazole gtt pending GI recs
   - consider testing for H. Pylori IgG / IgM
   - consider checking gastrin level for ZES
   #. Abdominal Pain: patient initially noted diffused abdominal pain,
   likely cramping related blood induced diarrhea.  Abdominal imaging was
   unremarkable.  Patient did have progressive leukocytosis from 16 to 33
   now to 22.3.   Patient has remained afebrile and suspicion for
   infection is low.  Believe this likely represents demargination from
   systemic inflammatory response.
   - keep NPO
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   - serial exams
   #. Leukocytosis:  patient continues to remain afebrile with substantial
   but downward trending leukocytosis.  Patient is s/p hip arthroplasty
   and infection of the prosthesis should be considered; however, exam is
   not concerning for infection
   - f/u pan cultures
   - take down dressing to evaluate hip wound
   - consider hip XR this afternoon with orthopedics consult to evaluate
   hip
   - repeat CXR
   #. HTN: holding Lisinopril in setting of GI bleed and hypotension at
   presentation.
   #. FEN: daily electrolytes with PRN repletion, NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male who underwent left total hip arthroplasty and was admitted with severe gastrointestinal bleeding requiring activation of the massive transfusion protocol. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, revealing bleeding in the duodenum with clots and a bleeding vessel noted in the bulb. Multiple non-bleeding ulcers were also found, and epinephrine was injected and 4 clips were placed with hemostasis achieved. The patient received a total of 15 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 5 fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 platelet, and 1 cryo product. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) improved from 25.6 to 30.7.

24-hour events include:
- EGD: red blood in duodenum with clots, bleeding vessel noted in bulb with multiple additional non-bleeding ulcers, epinephrine injected and 4 clips placed with hemostasis.
- Transfusion of 3 more units of PRBCs with bump in HCT from 25.6 to 28.6.
- Transfusion of 2 more units of PRBCs with bump in HCT from 28.6 to 30.6, then to 30.7.
- Total products received: 15 PRBCs, 5 FFP, 1 platelet, 1 cryo.
- Dramatic reduction in stool frequency and resolution of abdominal pain.
- Continued bleeding from the left hip arthroplasty site requiring dressing changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient initially presented with severe gastrointestinal bleeding, which was treated with an EGD and clipping of the bleeding vessel. Although hemostasis was achieved, the patient continues to receive blood products and pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) to prevent further bleeding. The history of NSAID use may contribute to the development of ulcers, and additional etiologies such as H. pylori infection and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome should be considered.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to the inflammatory response or an infection. Given the recent hip arthroplasty, infection of the prosthesis should be considered. Monitoring of the patient's fever and repeat cultures will help determine if an infection is present.
3. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which could be related to the GI bleed and was treated with the hold of Lisinopril (an antihypertensive medication) and fluid resuscitation.
4. Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is necessary.
5. Aspiration: The recent CXR showed opacification of the infrahilar left lobe, which could represent recent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension who underwent left total hip replacement for chronic left hip pain. The patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and received 4 units of packed red blood cells. An upper endoscopy revealed a bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb, which was clipped and injected. Non-bleeding ulcerations were also noted. The patient reported a history of substantial NSAID use prior to surgery. Additional etiologies for the ulcers may include H. Pylori and ZES.

The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels have been stable over the last 36 hours, although there is a slow trend down. This could be due to blood draws or slow ooze. The transfusion goal is set at HCT > 29, and if HCT continues to fall, a unit should be transfused.

The patient's diet was advanced to clears but made NPO after midnight due to the possibility of a gastrointestinal scope. Follow-up tests include H. Pylori IgG/IgM and repeating the endoscopy.

The patient initially experienced diffuse abdominal pain, likely related to blood-induced diarrhea. Abdominal imaging was unremarkable, and the patient has remained afebrile. The leukocytosis from 16 to 33 now to 22.3 is believed to represent demargination from the systemic inflammatory response.

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who underwent left total hip replacement for chronic left hip pain. He presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and received 4 units of packed red blood cells. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb, which was clipped and injected. Additional non-bleeding ulcerations were also noted. The patient reported substantial NSAID use prior to surgery, which could be an etiology for the ulcers along with H. pylori infection and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The patient's hematocrit levels have been stable overnight but have shown a slow trend down over the past three days. His leukocyte count is elevated, likely due to an inflammatory response. The patient's abdominal pain has largely resolved, and he is currently afebrile. He has a compression dressing applied to his hip wound and is awaiting further imaging and consultation from orthopedics. His medications include pantoprazole and he is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) for a procedure. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has already experienced GI bleeding and underwent an EGD procedure to identify and treat the source of bleeding. Continued monitoring and management of his coagulation status and hemodynamic stability will be crucial to prevent re-bleeding.

   1)GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)-
   -PPI IV
   -NPO for now
restart with GI clearance
   -Follow HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   -Will need GI to determine role for repeat EGD
   -H. Pylori pending
   -no NSAIDS

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male who underwent a total hip replacement (THR) and presented with a significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He is currently stable with a reasonable stability of hematocrit (HCT) across time following a GI procedure with injection and clip for local control. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate (HR) of 69 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 126/52 to 147/63 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 18 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 96%. The patient's physical examination shows no lower extremity edema and clear breath sounds. 

Lab results indicate a low hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 22.3 K/uL, elevated platelet count (Plt) ranging from 172-179 K/uL, normal creatinine (Cr) at 1.1 mg/dL, elevated glucose level at 136 mg/dL, and normal calcium (Ca++) and magnesium (Mg++) levels. Imaging reveals mild right hemidiaphragm elevation on chest X-ray (CXR). 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with an upper GI bleed, likely due to a post-THR complication. The plan includes continuing PPI IV, maintaining NPO status, and restarting with GI clearance. The"
