 INVASIVE VENTILATION - START [**2194-10-30**] 04:56 AM
    On arrival to the MICU she is screaming her name.  She cannot respond
   to questions of orientation. She had CT scan which showed LLL
   collapse.   Her RR remained high d/t her agitation.  She was thought to
   be in pain and was given morphine, she was sedated with ativan but
   remained agitated and tachypneic.  Even during short periods of
   stillness, her RR was in 30's and she sat'd in the 80's.  She was
   intubated at about 5am and put on CMV/Assist.  A repeat blood gas was
   done and was 7.34/38/130/21/-4.  Her morning Hct was 21 so she was
   transfused with 1 unit PRBC.

   Summary of HPI for morning rounds:
   87 yo F recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with liver
   metastases, HTN, who presented on [**2194-10-27**] after an unwitnessed fall
   and c/o R hip pain.  At baseline she is ambulatory but relies on her
   daughter for assistance with her aide for her activities of daily
   living. Per the patient's daughter she has had a slight increase in
   confusion recently.  The details of her fall are unclear.  CT-c-spine
   was without fracture.  CT head was without acute process.  Hip xray
   showed a right intertrochanteric-subtrochanteric fracture of the femur
   extending to the lesser trochanter. She was admitted to the medical
   service for further management.  She underwent open reduction and
   internal fixation of right hip fracture and closed reduction or right
   distal radius fracture. She tolerated the procedure well but had
   agitation post-operatively which was treated with IV haldol.  At
   approximately 2 PM on POD#1 she was noted to have acute hypoxia,
   tachypnea and tachycardia.  She was initially 80% on RA and this
   improved to low 90s on facemask and high 90s on a non-rebreather.
   Repeat CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.  ABG on a
   non-breather was  7.34/34/170.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no
   other changes compared to priors.  She was transferred to the MICU for
   further management.
    On arrival to the MICU she is screaming her name.  She could not
   respond to questions of orientation.  She was sedated with precedex and
   a femoral line was placed d/t lack of access.  Her BP went to SBP of
   70's and she was fluid bolused with rapid response. She had CT scan
   which showed LLL collapse.   Her RR remained high d/t her agitation.
   She was thought to be in pain and was given morphine, she was sedated
   with ativan but remained agitated and tachypneic.  Even during short
   periods of stillness, her RR was in 30's and she sat'd in the 80's.
   She was intubated at about 5am and put on CMV/Assist.  A repeat blood
   gas was done.

   CT CHEST w/ CONTRAST
   - Suboptimal contrast bolus to evaluate for PE. No central PE; however
   evaluation at segmental and subsegmental level is suboptimal.
   - Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for atelectasis; however
   cannot r/o
   pneumonia, or aspiration.
   - No large mucus plug seen; however if clinical concern endoscopy is
   more
   sensitive.
   - Small hiatal hernia
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 87 year old female with recently diagnosed
   pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension,
   osteoarthritis who presented on [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now
   s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and delerium.
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  Differential diagnosis includes
   pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, acute coronary ischemia, aspiration.
   CXR without evidence of edema or new infiltrates.  EKG without evidence
   of ischemia. Most concerning etiology at this time would be pulmonary
   or fat embolism.  CTA Chest suboptimal, but extensive LLL
   atelectasis.   Patient intubated at 5am
   - LENI
s today b/c safest study to eval for PE
   - d/t high pre-test prob and poor study, will cont. on IV heparin
   - treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc/Cipro for Gm+, -, and double pseudomonas
   - Influenza test and start Tamiflu at 75mg daily
   - induced sputum and mini-BAL
   - bronchoscopy today to look for mucus plug
   - EKG repeat
   - serial cardiac enzymes
   - echocardiogram given fall, murmur on exam, worsening hypoxia
   - continue ventilation w/ midaz/fentanyl drip.
   - decreased FiO2 to 70%
   -ABG
s whenever change in resp status
   .
   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up but
   - ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection
   - blood cultures pending
   - influenza swab; sputum cultures (induced)
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   #Elevated Lactate:  Lactate on arrival was 3.5, now 1.6. Initial
   concern that this may be related to poor tissue perfusion either from
   surgery, infection, pulmonary embolism or cardiac event.
   - follow blood cultures
   - trend lactate q 12h
   - workup of hypoxia as above
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood
   - gave 1 unit of blood this morning because at transfusion goal and
   resp distress
   - give blood with goal of Hct of 30
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q 6h
   - transfusion goal < 21
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - consider social work consult
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently in 100s systolic. Given
   concern for pulmonary embolism will hold home antihypertensives.
   - holding home metoprolol
   .
   #Depression:
   - continue duloxetine 60 mg daily
   - continue ativan 0.5 mg PO QID:PRN
   .
   #Polymyalgia Rheumatica:  Unclear details.  Per OMR she is on 1 mg
   prednisone daily but per assisted lving she is on prednisone 10 mg QAM
   and 1 mg QPM.  On chronic steroids and now has significant stress.
   - Stress dose steroids 50mg q6 hydrocortisone and fludricortisone
   0.05mg
   FEN: NPO for now, NS @ 100 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes
   Prophylaxis: IV heparin, bowel regimen, PPI
   Access: Femoral CVL, move to IJ when able to

   - Small hiatal hernia
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 87 year old female with recently diagnosed
   pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension,
   osteoarthritis who presented on [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now
   s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and delerium.
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  Differential diagnosis includes
   pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, acute coronary ischemia, aspiration.
   CXR without evidence of edema or new infiltrates.  EKG without evidence
   of ischemia. Most concerning etiology at this time would be pulmonary
   or fat embolism.  CTA Chest suboptimal, but extensive LLL atelectasis.
     Patient intubated at 5am
   - d/t high pre-test prob and poor study, will cont. on IV heparin
   - treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc/Cipro for Gm+, -, and double pseudomonas
   - induced sputum and mini-BAL
   - bronchoscopy today to look for mucus plug
   - EKG
   - serial cardiac enzymes
   - echocardiogram given fall, murmur on exam, worsening hypoxia
   - continue ventilation w/ midaz/fentanyl drip.  Wean as tolerates RSBI
   and SBT
   -ABG
s whenever change in resp status
   .
   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up but
   - ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection
   - blood cultures pending
   - influenza swab; sputum cultures (induced)
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   #Elevated Lactate:  Lactate on arrival was 3.5, now 1.6. Initial
   concern that this may be related to poor tissue perfusion either from
   surgery, infection, pulmonary embolism or cardiac event.
   - follow blood cultures
   - trend lactate q 12h
   - workup of hypoxia as above
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood
   - gave 1 unit of blood this morning because at transfusion goal and
   resp distress
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q 6h
   - transfusion goal < 21
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - consider social work consult
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently in 100s systolic. Given
   concern for pulmonary embolism will hold home antihypertensives.
   - holding home metoprolol
   .
   #Depression:
   - continue duloxetine 60 mg daily
   - continue ativan 0.5 mg PO QID:PRN
   .
   #Polymyalgia Rheumatica:  Unclear details.  Per OMR she is on 1 mg
   prednisone daily but per assisted lving she is on prednisone 10 mg QAM

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of pancreatic/colon cancer and liver metastases. She presented on 10/27/2194 after an unwitnessed fall and complained of right hip pain. The patient is ambulatory but relies on her daughter for assistance with activities of daily living. She also had a slight increase in confusion recently.

The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of her right hip fracture and closed reduction of her right distal radius fracture. However, she had agitation post-operatively, which was treated with IV Haldol. On POD#1, she was noted to have acute hypoxia, tachypnea, and tachycardia. She was initially 80% on RA and this improved to low 90s on facemask and high 90s on a non-rebreather. A repeat CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process. ABG on a non-breather was 7.34/34/170. EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no other changes compared to priors. She was transferred to the MICU for further management.

Upon arrival in the MICU, the patient was screaming her name and could not respond to questions of orientation. She was sedated with precedex and a femoral line was placed due to lack of access. Her BP went to SBP of 70s and she was fluid"

   Addendum
   Met with family several times throughout the day today.  We reviewed
   Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 9417**]
s current status, including her development of respiratory
   failure, as well as the fact that her overall prognosis is limited by
   metastatic cancer.  They expressed concern about her
very low pain
   threshold.
  After working through several potential options, they
   believe that Ms. [**Known lastname 9392**] would direct us as follows:
          Trial of aggressive therapy for 2
 3 days (including
   procedures)
          If there are signs of major decompensation and setbacks,
   then move to comfort-focused care.  Specifically:
   o         No resuscitation from pulseless arrest
   o         No pressors for shock
   o         No dialysis for ARF

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia and has a high pre-test probability for pulmonary embolism (PE) with a negative but suboptimal CT angiography (CTA). She also has a hip fracture that underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), anemia secondary to acute blood loss, recently diagnosed metastatic cancer, and other comorbidities.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 101.8°F, tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 82-35 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. She is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 80%. Her blood gases show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 163, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 6.8 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count (Plt) of 295 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormalities in electrolyte and kidney"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, pneumonia, a hip fracture after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), anemia secondary to acute blood loss, recently diagnosed metastatic cancer, and a high pre-test probability for pulmonary embolism (PE) with a negative but suboptimal computed tomography angiography (CTA). She is currently on invasive ventilation, has a fever, and is unable to provide history due to sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of infection, and potentially septic shock.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the initial CTA was negative, there is still a high pre-test probability for PE. If PE is confirmed, it can cause further respiratory distress and potentially lead to right ventricular strain or failure.
3. Hip Fracture Complications: The patient has a hip fracture that has already undergone ORIF. There is a risk of complications such as infection, non-union, or malunion, which may affect mobility and overall prognosis.
4. Anemia: The patient is experiencing anemia secondary to acute blood loss. This can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and exacerbate respiratory distress.
5. Metastatic Cancer: The patient's recently diagnosed metastatic cancer increases the risk of cancer-related complications, such as spread to other"

   Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   CXR [**10-30**]
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Previously seen line at the right lung apex likely represents a
   skinfold.
   If continuous clinical concern, repeat radiograph in few hours can be
   done.
   2. Retrocardiac opacification, with air bronchogram, and opacification
   at the
   left hilum, similar compared to prior radiograph, concerning for
   pneumonia.

   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  Differential diagnosis includes
   pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, acute coronary ischemia, aspiration.
   CXR without evidence of edema or new infiltrates.  EKG without evidence
   of ischemia. Most concerning etiology at this time would be pulmonary
   or fat embolism.  CTA Chest suboptimal, but extensive LLL
   atelectasis.   Patient intubated at 5am

   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up until extubated.
   - ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection
   - blood cultures pending
   - influenza swab; sputum cultures (induced) all pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   #Elevated Lactate:  Lactate on arrival was 3.5, now 1.6. Initial
   concern that this may be related to poor tissue perfusion either from
   surgery, infection, pulmonary embolism or cardiac event.
   - follow blood cultures
   - trend lactate q 24h
   - workup of hypoxia as above
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]

   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood
   - give blood with goal of Hct of 30; will need to give unit of blood
   this morning
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q 8h
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - consider social work consult
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently in 100s systolic. Given
   concern for pulmonary embolism will hold home antihypertensives.
   - holding home metoprolol

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer and liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis who presented with a right hip fracture and acute hypoxia and delirium. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues including respiratory distress, elevated lactate, delirium, anemia, pancreatic/colon cancer, hypertension, depression, polymyalgia rheumatica, and a history of allergies to amoxicillin, sulfonamides, and penicillins.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- She has been receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and analgesia.
- A bronchoscopy was performed, which did not reveal any mucus plug.
- An echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and hyperdynamic function, but no right heart strain.
- The patient's lactate levels have improved from 3.5 to 1.6.
- She has been treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection and pneumonia.
- The patient's blood cultures are negative.
- The patient's family has chosen to withhold information about her pancreatic/colon cancer diagnosis until a specific holiday.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. If her condition worsens, she may require further respiratory support such as trache"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer and liver metastases. She presented with right hip fracture and was operated on with acute hypoxia and delirium. The echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and hyperdynamic function with mild aortic stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia, tachypnea, and tachycardia after hip fracture. Pneumonia is suspected.
2. Delirium: The patient is agitated and unable to respond to questions. Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary tract infection), medications, pain, and constipation.
3. Elevated lactate: The initial lactate level was 3.5, indicating poor tissue perfusion. Further workup is needed to determine the cause.
4. Fall: The patient had an unwitnessed fall, possibly due to syncope or mechanical fall. Monitoring on telemetry and PT consult are recommended.
5. Hip/wrist fractures: The patient has right Colles fracture and right hip fracture. Orthopedic consultation is ongoing.
6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit was low on admission, likely related to colonic malignancy. Blood transfusion is planned to maintain"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of pancreatic/colon cancer, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She presented with right hip fracture and acute hypoxia, which led to intubation. She has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. She also has a urinary tract infection and is being treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient's mental status is altered, and she is experiencing delirium. She has been given haloperidol for delirium and fentanyl for pain. The family has decided to withhold the information of her cancer diagnosis from her until a certain holiday. The patient's blood pressure is under control, and she is being closely monitored for any changes in her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in her respiratory function, and extubation may be attempted if she shows improvement.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. If not appropriately treated, there is a risk of worsening infection and possible sepsis.
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status and delirium. If not managed effectively, there is a risk of persistent confusion and worsening cognitive function.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely related to her malignancy. If not properly managed, there is a risk"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed pancreatic and colon cancer, hypertension, osteoarthritis, who presented with right hip fracture and acute hypoxia. She was intubated and diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. She is currently on aggressive care with the goal of extubation by Sunday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress, hypoxia, and tachypnea indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be caused by infection, medications, pain, or constipation. She is agitated and unable to respond to questions.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, which requires treatment with antibiotics.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely related to her colonic malignancy. She has received blood transfusions but her hematocrit levels are still low.
5. Fall and Hip Fracture: The patient had an unwitnessed fall resulting in a hip fracture. She underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).
6. Cancer Progression: The patient has metastatic colon and pancreatic cancer, and it is unclear how her overall condition will progress given her cancer diagnosis.

The patient's family does not want to disclose her cancer diagnosis at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray and is being treated for it. There is a risk of progression or complications such as sepsis.
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be caused by various factors including infection, medication, pain, or constipation. There is a risk of continued agitation and inability to respond appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely related to her colonic malignancy. There is a risk of worsening anemia and potential complications such as heart failure.
5. Elevated lactate levels: The patient's lactate levels were initially elevated, indicating possible poor tissue perfusion. Monitoring is necessary to ensure that this does"

   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 906**] met extensively with family, they want to try to wean vent
   until sunday. If she can be extubated, go ahead w/ rehab, but not tell
   mother of cancer and not pursue treatment, as they had decided
   previously.  If she worsens, may consider withdrawing care.  If
   unchanged, will reassess.

   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up until extubated.
   - cefepime for pan-sensitive for Ecoli

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of pancreatic/colon cancer, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She presented on [**2194-10-27**] with a right hip fracture and was operated on (ORIF). The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute hypoxia and delirium. She has worsening bibasilar opacifications and worsening left lower lobe collapse on chest X-ray. The endotracheal tube should be pulled back as it terminates 1.8 cm from the carina. The patient's urine culture shows E. coli.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient has been treated for pneumonia with cefepime and vancomycin, but cultures are still pending. There is no mucus plug on bronchoscopy, so it is unclear if the pneumonia is improving.
2. Delirium: The patient has been agitated and unable to respond to questions. Differential diagnosis includes infection, medications, pain, and constipation. Zyprexa has been started and seems to be working well for patient agitation.
3. Fall risk: The patient had an unwitnessed fall, and the differential diagnosis includes syncope versus mechanical fall. The patient has aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR, and will need monitoring on telemetry, PT consult when stable, and orthostatics when stable.
4. Hip/wrist fractures: The patient has right Col"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 87-year-old woman with newly diagnosed metastatic colon and pancreatic cancer. She was admitted after a fall and hip fracture, and she also has post-operative pneumonia (PNA) and respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition is stable, with vital signs within normal ranges. She is still on mechanical ventilation support, but at low settings. The main barriers to extubation are her agitation and sedation requirements. 

The patient has a history of chronic steroid use for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which may require stress dose steroids during this critical illness. She also has metastatic colon and pancreatic cancer with liver metastases, as well as a hip fracture that was surgically repaired on October 28th. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Her kidney function is mildly impaired, but liver function is within normal limits. 

Microbiology tests indicate a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, but there are no other significant infections detected. 

The patient's medical complications include electrolyte and fluid disorders, hypertension, pain control, pneumonia due to aspiration, anemia, delirium/confusion, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and ventilator dependence. 

The patient's care plan includes managing her electrolyte and fluid imbalances, controlling hypertension, providing pain management for both acute and chronic pain, treating pneumonia, addressing anemia"

   87 year old female with recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with
   liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis who presented on
   [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and
   delirium, intubated. Testing negative for PE.  Now extubated, plan is
   to return to home/hospice for palliative care of metastatic pancreatic
   ca.
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  Found to have hospital-acquired
   pneumonia on CT.  DFA negative for flu, but cultures pending.  No mucus
   plug on bronch.
   - continue to treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc; day [**4-17**]
   - change vanc to q 24h rather than q48 h b/c of improving renal
   function
   - stop tamiflu and d/c precautions for influenza
   - f/u induced sputum and mini-BAL (NTD) culture
   - continue ventilation w/ fentanyl drip for pain and haldo/zyprexal for
   delirium
   - attempt to extubate today; family meeting about re-intubation if
   fails extubation
   .
   # Leukocytosis: On stress-dose steroids, but leukocytosis started
   afterwards.
   - wean steroids back to home dose of 5mg prednisone daily.
   - pan-culture today.
   .
   #Delerium/agitation:  On Zyprexa 10mg TID w/ improved agitation but
   persistently altered mental status.
   Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary tract
   infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated and
   unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult to
   work-up until extubated.
   - cefepime for pan-sensitive for Ecoli
   - blood cultures pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - Haldol changed to Zyprexa 10mg [**Hospital1 **] as worked much better for patient
   agitation
   - MRI in the future possibly
   .
   #Goals of Care: Daughters had previously decided that they did not want
   to tell their mother that she has cancer.
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent,
   fentanyl when on vent.
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood.
   - daughter would not like patient to receive further blood.
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q12h with goal Hct>25.
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - Palliative care involved.
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Depression:
   - stop duloxetine 60 mg daily b/c cannot be crushed
   - started Zyprexa and tolerated well.
   .
   #Polymyalgia Rheumatica:  Unclear details.  Per OMR she is on 1 mg
   prednisone daily but per assisted lving she is on prednisone 10 mg QAM
   and 1 mg QPM.  On chronic steroids and now has significant stress.
   - Stress dose steroids 50mg q6 hydrocortisone and fludricortisone
   0.05mg changed to 25mg hydrocortisone q6hours, and continue same dose
   fludricortisone.  Wean further tomorrow.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She presented with a right hip fracture and acute hypoxia, leading to intubation. The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, delirium, pain control, anemia, and depression.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial hypoxia and tachypnea, along with the diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia, indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and appropriate respiratory support may be necessary.

2. Delirium: The patient's persistent altered mental status and agitation suggest ongoing delirium. It is important to address potential causes such as infection, medications, pain, and constipation, and provide reorientation and a normal sleep/wake cycle.

3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's laboratory results show imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium levels, indicating an electrolyte disorder. Close monitoring and correction of these imbalances are crucial.

4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis, known urinary tract infection, and hospital-acquired pneumonia indicate a risk for further infections. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and infection control measures should be implemented.

5. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels suggest anemia, likely related to her colonic malignancy. Monitoring"

   #Delerium/agitation:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known
   urinary tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently
   agitated and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so
   difficult to work-up until extubated.
   - cefepime for pan-sensitive for Ecoli
   - blood cultures pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - Haldol changed to Zyprexa 10mg [**Hospital1 **] as worked much better for patient
   agitation
   - MRI in the future possibly
   .
   #Goals of Care: Daughters had previously decided that they did not want
   to tell their mother that she has cancer.
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]

   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent,
   fentanyl when on vent.
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood.
   - daughter would not like patient to receive further blood.
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q12h with goal Hct>25.
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - Palliative care involved.
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She presented on 2194-10-27 with a right hip fracture, which was surgically treated with ORIF. She experienced acute hypoxia and delirium, leading to intubation. 

The patient's current medical complications include ineffective coping, electrolyte & fluid disorder, hypertension, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), pneumonia (aspiration), anemia (other), delirium/confusion, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure (acute). 

Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/83 mmHg to 102/56 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, increased lactic acid levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including sodium, potassium, and phosphate. Imaging studies reveal markedly improved chest X-rays with continued improvement. 

The patient has received various treatments, including antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, blood transfusions, pain management with opioids, and medications for delirium and confusion. 

The patient's family has decided not to inform her about"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer, who also had a hip fracture repair requiring intubation. She was extubated yesterday and has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

24-hour events include the initiation of invasive ventilation. The patient's allergies are documented, along with the last doses of antibiotics administered. She is receiving various medications, including lorazepam, enoxaparin, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and metoprolol. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of respiratory distress. Physical examination findings include sinus tachycardia, high blood pressure, and altered mental status. The patient is not assessed for peripheral vascular status, skin integrity, or movement. 

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 180/78 to 137/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented. 

Laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range"
