   Disposition: ICU until Extubate
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of emphysema/COPD and prior cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). She was admitted hypoxic, tachycardic, and confused. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may be experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia (PNA), a COPD flare, or a COPD flare complicated by an infection. The plan is to continue pressure support ventilation (PSV) and consider extubation, possibly to bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). ABG monitoring will be done to guide weaning of the ventilator.

2. Found down/FTT: The patient was found down, and it is unclear whether this is related to failure to thrive (FTT) or acute illness. The plan includes checking thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and vitamin B12 levels, treating hypercalcemia, and performing a head CT to rule out any acute processes.

3. Tachycardia: The patient is tachycardic, and the plan is to hydrate with intravenous fluids (IVF) and provide boluses for urine output and tachycardia. Continuous monitoring of the heart rate is recommended.

4. Lung nodule: A lung nodule is suspicious for malignancy, especially considering the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female who was found unresponsive with decreased responsiveness, tachycardia, and tachypnea. She was intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient was transferred to the ICU where she was placed on a ventilator and eventually extubated after a review of her CT scan showing left lower lobe pneumonia. She also presented with signs of significant dehydration and hypovolemia.

Assessment and Plan:
1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]) - This is secondary to underlying COPD and worsened by left-sided pneumonia. The patient is experiencing increased respiratory distress and active infection, leading to progression to respiratory failure with minimal evidence of exacerbation of underlying reactive airways disease.
- Treatment includes Vanco/Levo/CTX for pneumonia, Albuterol/Atrovent for COPD, and intermittent use of NIPPV for support and weaning.
2) HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM) - Continue free water replacement.
3) PULMONARY NODULE - Concerning for malignancy. Will need follow-up evaluation and biopsy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is likely due to underlying COPD and worsened by left-sided pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. The patient may require continued"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a [**Male First Name (un)**] with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has undergone several tests and treatments, including a CTA that showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or dissection, but revealed a nodule at the lingula which may need further investigation for possible malignancy. The patient is also being treated for pneumonia with antibiotics and is on BiPAP for respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/52 mmHg to 173/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient has received infusions of heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total input of 2,237 mL of fluids, with 120 mL given orally, 50 mL through tube feeding, and 2,037 mL through intravenous fluids. The total output includes 1,810 mL of urine and 620 mL of blood products. The balance shows a negative fluid balance of 620 mL.

Respiratory support is being provided through a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode, delivering 35%"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a history of emphysema/COPD and prior CVAs.
- She was found hypoxic, tachycardic, and confused.
- The patient experienced respiratory failure, which could be due to pneumonia (PNA) or a COPD flare-up.
- She was intubated but extubated the next morning and is now comfortable on a nasal cannula.
- The patient has a lung nodule that is suspicious for malignancy, especially considering her smoking history.
- She also has hypernatremia, likely due to dehydration from poor oral intake.
- The patient's tachycardia resolved with intravenous fluids (IVF).
- Her hypercalcemia also resolved with IVF.
- She has been receiving antibiotics and bronchodilators as part of her treatment.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to be transferred to the medicine floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience further respiratory distress or develop respiratory failure if her underlying COPD or any infection worsens.
2. Lung Nodule: The suspicious lung nodule could potentially be indicative of lung cancer or metastasis from another primary cancer. Further investigation and follow-up imaging are necessary to determine the nature of the nodule.
3. Dehydration: The patient's hypernatremia indicates dehydration. If she does not improve her oral"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-inch tall individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 122/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 100% on a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

The patient has received a total of 2,237 mL of fluids, with an intake of 120 mL through the oral route, 50 mL through the tube feeding route, and 2,037 mL through the intravenous fluid route. The patient has had a total output of 1,810 mL, with 620 mL through blood product transfusions and 1,190 mL through other routes. The urine output has been 1,810 mL, and the NG output has been 620 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes a FiO2 of 35%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and a PIP of 10 cmH2O. The ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 195. 

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 5.7 K/uL, Hct level of 41.0%, Plt count of 253 K/uL, Cr level of 0.8 mg/dL, TCO2 level of 29 mEq/L, Glucose level of 295 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal ranges. 

The patient has a history of arterial line placement on [**2185-6-9**] 06:59 PM and two peripheral IV lines placed on [**2185-6-9**] 04:13 PM. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's high glucose level indicates a need for glycemic control. The elevated LDH level suggests possible tissue damage or hemolysis. The slightly elevated WBC count may indicate an infection or inflammatory response. Additionally, the patient's low platelet count could be a sign of platelet consumption or destruction. 

Overall, the patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but further evaluation and management are necessary to address the abnormal lab values and prevent potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 72-year-old female with decreased responsiveness found in her assistant living facility.
- Upon arrival, she had tachycardia, tachypnea, and was intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia.
- The patient was transferred to the ICU and placed on a ventilator. She was later extubated after reviewing the CT scan, which showed clear evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia.
- Multiple indices suggest significant dehydration in addition to hypovolemia.
- The etiology of being found down is unclear, and there is evidence of stroke. Possible left lower lobe pneumonia in the context of fibrosis (honeycombing on CT) and severe emphysema.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS/Doctor Last Name 2): This is secondary to underlying severe COPD and worsened with left-sided pneumonia and increased respiratory distress.

2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has increased sodium levels, suggesting significant dehydration. Measures should be taken to encourage oral intake and repeat electrolytes in the PM to follow sodium levels.

3. Pulmonary Nodule: There is a concerning pulmonary nodule, which could be malignancy. Further evaluation and biopsy are recommended.

4. Anorexia: The patient has an"
