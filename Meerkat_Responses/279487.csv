","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a complex medical history. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with MRSA sepsis and a pacemaker infection, requiring transfer for epicardial pacemaker placement. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 60 bpm with a paced rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 100/68 mmHg to 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of chronic illness, with no distress. The HEENT examination is notable for pink conjunctivae and normal oral mucosa. The cardiovascular examination shows no palpable PMI, regular S1 and S2 heart sounds, and a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 44%. The patient also has a history of hypertension but no evidence of diastolic dysfunction on most recent echo. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation, but there are fine crackles bilaterally at the lung bases. 

The abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. Extremity examination shows cool lower extremities bilaterally, trace edema at the ankles, multiple small ulcerations on toes bilaterally, and cyanotic upper extremities"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis, pacemaker infection, and dilated cardiomyopathy. He was admitted from another hospital for epicardial pacemaker placement due to a pacemaker infection. The patient has multiple medical complications, including chronic atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, acute renal failure, benign prostatic hyperplasia with urinary retention, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The patient is currently on various medications, including vancomycin for MRSA sepsis, heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism, and protonix for GERD. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/68 to 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

Physical examination reveals the presence of dry, fine crackles bilaterally at the end expiration, cool lower extremities with multiple small ulcerations on toes bilaterally, trace edema at ankles, cyanotic upper extremities to the wrists, and stasis dermatitis. Neurological examination shows cogwheel rigidity in the upper extremities and decreased sensation to the left half of the tibia bilaterally.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 400 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11"

","The patient is a 78-year-old male who was admitted from another hospital with MRSA sepsis and a pacemaker infection. He is currently externally paced due to a planned epicardial pacemaker placement. The patient has been prescribed vancomycin for 4 weeks and will undergo an echo to rule out the possibility of left heart infective endocarditis, which would require a 6-week treatment course.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/45 mmHg to 125/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on heparin sodium infusion and has been prescribed various medications such as vancomycin, pantoprazole, and albuterol.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry, fine crackles bilaterally at the end expiration, multiple small ulcerations on toes bilaterally, trace edema at ankles, and cyanotic upper extremities. The patient also exhibits cogwheel rigidity in both upper extremities and decreased sensation to the left half of the tibia bilaterally.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, mild leukocytosis with left shift, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and lactate levels. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 44%, chronic atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, acute renal failure (ARF), positive urine analysis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension, pulmonary embolism, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's plan includes monitoring blood pressures, holding beta-blockers due to relative hypotension, strict intake/output measurements, daily weight monitoring, heparin gtt for rhythm control and pulmonary embolism, and pacing at 60 bpm with capturing nearly all beats.

Potential medical complications that can arise include MRSA sepsis, infective endocarditis, pacemaker infection, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, acute renal failure, pulmonary embolism, anemia, BPH/urinary retention, hypertension, and COPD exacerbation."

The patient has a baseline creatinine of 0.8, now elevated to 1.0, likely due to pre-renal azotemia. The patient's urinalysis is positive, but he is asymptomatic, suggesting possible colonization.

The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia and sepsis, currently on IV vancomycin. The goal vancomycin trough level is 15-20. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

The patient also has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, for which he is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis, transferred for epicardial pacemaker placement. He has a past medical history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and remote ethanol abuse. The patient is currently in the ICU due to a suspected pacemaker infection. His vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing relative hypotension. The patient's labs show elevated blood glucose levels and evidence of iron deficiency anemia. He has positive findings for chronic atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, acute renal failure (pre-renal), and anemia. The patient also has a history of urinary retention and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA sepsis, and there is a concern for ongoing bacteremia. Monitoring his fever curve and white blood cell count is important. Additionally, surveillance blood cultures should be done to assess for any new infections.
2. Pacemaker Infection: The patient's pacemaker has been infected with MRSA, leading to his current admission. An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed to evaluate for infective endocarditis, which will guide the duration of therapy.
3. Chronic Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, and his rhythm is now paced atrial fibrillation. He is on"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male admitted from the outside hospital with MRSA sepsis and a pacemaker infection. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including being placed on heparin gtt, holding ASA and BBK due to relative hypotension, and planning for epicardial pacemaker placement.

The patient's medical history includes dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 44%, hypertension, and a remote history of EtOH abuse. He also has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and is currently being venous paced through his internal jugular vein. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/58 mmHg to 66/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals multiple small ulcerations on toes bilaterally, with one ulcer on the left leg with eschar. There is also trace edema at the ankles and cyanotic upper extremities to the wrists. Neurological examination shows cogwheel rigidity in both upper extremities, along with decreased sensation to the left half of the tibia bilaterally.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) and lactate, while other parameters such as hemoglobin,"
