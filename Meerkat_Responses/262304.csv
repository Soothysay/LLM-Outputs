   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II with peripheral neuropathy, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. He presented from an outside hospital with subdural hematoma (SDH) after a fall and now has hypertensive urgency requiring Nicardipine infusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has an elevated blood pressure. He is currently off Nicardipine and will be managed with oral and intravenous medications.

The plan includes controlling hypertension with metoprolol and Hydralazine, up-titrating metoprolol as needed, and possibly adding Amlodipine in the morning if the patient continues to have high blood pressure. Neurological checks will be done every four hours, and the patient will continue on Keppra 500 mg PO BID.

For the subdural hematoma, the patient's stable condition on the CT scan will be monitored with blood pressure control as mentioned above. Neurological checks will also be done every four hours, and the patient will continue on Keppra 500 mg PO BID. Follow-up nephrology recommendations will be followed, and the patient will continue with hemodialysis three times a week.

Regarding diabetes management, oral anti-hyperglycemics will be held, and regular insulin sliding scale will be used while the patient is in-house.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II with peripheral neuropathy, atrial fibrillation (AFib) on Coumadin. He presented from an outside hospital (OSH) with subdural hematoma (SDH) after a fall. The patient was treated for hypertensive urgency and subsequently became hypotensive. He received multiple blood pressure medications, which may have contributed to his hypotension. The patient also underwent a 3.5L HD. There is a concern for sepsis due to the patient's fever.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Blood pressure control: Hold antihypertensives, monitor fever curve and white blood cell count, check sputum and follow blood cultures. An echocardiogram will be done to evaluate systolic function.
2. SDH: The patient's stable condition on CT scan today will be monitored along with blood pressure management. He will continue on Keppra 500 mg PO BID, have neuro checks every 4 hours, follow nutrition recommendations, and hold Coumadin.
3. ESRD: The patient is scheduled for HD on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. However, he went for HD today. He will have fluid goals even with blood pressure lability, continue with HD, and follow nephrology recommendations.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, and type II diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy. He has atrial fibrillation and was on Coumadin. The patient presented from OSH with subdural hematoma (SDH) and hypertensive urgency following a fall. He was treated with antihypertensives and received 3.5 liters of hemodialysis, resulting in hypotension. Sepsis is not ruled out.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Blood pressure control: The patient's blood pressure needs to be monitored closely due to the recent use of antihypertensives and the potential for recurrent hypotension or hypertensive episodes.
2. SDH: The patient's SDH is stable on the CT scan today. However, it is important to continue monitoring the patient's blood pressure and neurologic status, including q4h neuro checks. It is also recommended to follow up with neurosurgery recommendations.
3. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week, but received hemodialysis today. It is important to continue with regular hemodialysis sessions and follow up with nephrology recommendations. Fluid management may be challenging due to blood pressure lability.
4. DM: Oral anti-hyperglycemics should be held, and the patient should be covered with regular insulin sliding scale while"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II with peripheral neuropathy, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. The patient presented to the hospital with a subdural hematoma (SDH) and hypertensive urgency following a fall. He was treated with antihypertensives and received 3.5 liters of hemodialysis, resulting in hypotension.

The patient's current conditions include controlled blood pressure, stable SDH on CT scan, evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray (CXR), and recent hypoglycemia. The patient is also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and has a history of diabetes.

The plan of care includes blood pressure control with a gradual increase in home blood pressure medications and the addition of diltiazem if stable. The patient will be monitored for fever curve and white blood cell count. Blood cultures and sputum cultures will be followed up.

For the SDH, the patient will continue with neuro checks every 4 hours and follow up nephrology recommendations. Hemodialysis will be continued, with a suggested fluid goal reduction of 1-3 liters due to evidence of volume overload on CXR and exam.

In regards to diabetes management, oral anti-hyperglycemic medications will be held, and the patient will be started on an insulin sliding scale"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II with peripheral neuropathy. He presented from the outside hospital with subdural hematoma (SDH) and hypertensive urgency. After treatment for a fall, the patient experienced hypotension and received 3.5L HD. Currently, the patient is in the ICU and is being monitored for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Blood pressure control: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently experiencing hypertension. The plan is to resume home blood pressure medications as needed, monitor the fever curve and white blood cell count, and follow up with sputum and blood cultures.
2. SDH: The patient's SDH appears to be stable on the CT scan today. Monitoring of blood pressure will continue, along with neurologic checks every 4 hours. The patient will also follow up with nose suction recommendations and Coumadin will be held.
3. ESRD: The patient is on HD three times a week but went for HD today. It is suggested to aim for a fluid goal reduction of 1-3L today due to evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray and exam. Blood pressures have been restored.
4. DM: The oral anti-hyperglycemic medications will be held, and insulin sliding scale will be initiated due to the episode of hypoglycemia. The dosage will be uptitrated as necessary.
5. Afib on Coumadin: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and is currently on Coumadin. Given the recent fall, the patient may not be a candidate to continue on Coumadin. Neurosurgery will be consulted regarding anticoagulation in the context of SDH. The patient will need to be off anticoagulation for 4 weeks and then should be seen in the hospital clinic to reevaluate. It is okay to restart [Last Name (LF) 5055] and SQ hep.
6. RUE swelling: Good pulses are present, so there is low concern for central venous line complication. Thrombosis is a possibility, and a right upper extremity (RUE) ultrasound has been performed. An RUQ echo is also planned.
7. FEN (fluid, electrolyte, and nutrition): The patient has low sodium and is on a diabetic diet. It is important to check and replete electrolytes to goal (K>4, Mg>2).

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yom w/ ESRD on HD, HTN, DM Type II with peripheral neuropathy, and
   AFIB (on coumadin at home) who presented from OSH s/p fall with SDH and
   hypertensive urgency treated w antihypertensives and -3.5L HD with
   resulting hypotension.
   PLAN
   #. Blood pressure control
 now with hypertension: Metoprolol 25 TID.
   -          Added home diltiazam 30 TID
   -          monitor
   # SDH:  Stable neurologically. Holding coumadin.
   -          cont Keppra 500 mg PO BID to be dosed after HD on HD days
   -          f/u NS recs
   # ESRD:  Patient on HD M/W/F usually. Had HD [**10-2**].  Now seemingly
   anuric.
   -          f/u Nephrology recs
   -          Keppra to be dosed after HD on HD days
   -          Bladder scan to assess for obstruction after foley removal
   since patient normally urinates
   #. DM
   -          hold oral anti-hyperglycemic.  Given episode of
   hypoglycemia, will change to
 insulin sliding scale for now.
   -          Uptitrate as necessary
   # Afib on Coumadin:  Patient with history of afib on coumadin. Given
   recent fall, patient likely not a candidate to cont on coumadin.
   Discussed with neurosurg. regarding anticoagulation in context of SDH.
   Will need to be off anticoagulation for 4 weeks and then should be seen
   in [**Hospital 5054**] clinic to reeval.  OK to restart [**Hospital 369**] and SQ hep
   -          hold coumadin
   -          [**Last Name (LF) 5055**], [**First Name3 (LF) 369**] 81 mg QD
   -          Neurosurgery follow up
   # RUE swelling.  Good pulses so low concern for CVL complication.
   Thrombosis is possible
   -          RUQ echo
   #. FEN
   -          low sodium, diabetic diet

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II with peripheral neuropathy, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). He presented to the hospital after falling and suffering from a subdural hematoma (SDH) and hypertensive urgency. He was treated with antihypertensives and received -3.5L HD, which resulted in hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Blood pressure control: The patient has hypertension that needs to be managed with medications such as Metoprolol and Diltiazem.
2. SDH: The patient's SDH is stable neurologically, and he is currently holding Coumadin. It is recommended to continue monitoring his neurological status and follow up with neurosurgery recommendations.
3. ESRD: The patient is on HD three times a week. He recently had HD on [**10-2**] and is now seemingly anuric (not urinating). It is recommended to follow up with nephrology recommendations and perform a bladder scan to assess for obstruction after Foley removal since the patient normally urinates.
4. DM: The patient's oral anti-hyperglycemic medications should be held due to an episode of hypoglycemia. It is recommended to change to"
