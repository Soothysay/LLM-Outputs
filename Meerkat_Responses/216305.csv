   Assessment and Plan
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   73 year old man with COPD (FEV1 0.96), HTN, hyperlipidemia and recent
   GIB from PUD presents 2 days post discharge, intubated at home by
   paramedics after c/o increasing dyspnea.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Events surrounding presentation unclear.  COPD
   exacerbation [**1-26**] lack of prednisone on last discharge, with question of
   component of PE, with mild CHF.  No e/o volume overload on exam
   currently, and no e/o pneumonia.
   - continue IV steroids currently -> transition to PO steroids today
   - continue standing MDIs
   - Ctx/azithromycin -> pending cultures, narrow to azithromycin today
   - sputum, blood cultures
   - repeat TTE  -> new wall motion abnormalities -> will consult
   cardiology
   .
   # COPD:  With FEV1 of 0.96.  ?Exacerbation on presentation on [**12-2**]
   requiring intubation in the ED, but details surrounding his respiratory
   failure at that time are unclear per d/c summary.  He is not currently
   bronchospastic on exam but air moving poorly.
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - continue serevent
   - holding spiriva given standing short acting ipratropium
   - PO steroids today and monitor for changes
   .
   # Hypotension:  Normally hypertensive at baseline.  Presented with SBPs
   in the 90s where he has largely remained stable despite 6L IVFs.  ? d/t
   underlying infection (UA underwhelming, CT chest without e/o infiltrate
   and no other clear localizing sx of infection).  Also may be partially
   med related (fentanyl/versed) although BP was aleady lower than normal
   on presentation and unclear what he received in the field for
   intubation.  Cardiac cause also very possible given positive cardiac
   enzymes.  SBPs currently stable in the 130's this morning.  Not on
   chronic steroids not suspicious of adrenal insufficiency at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   - pan culturing with blood, urine, sputum
   - serial EKGs and CEs with TTE in am
   - Empiric antibiotics for now
   .
   # PE:  On [**12-11**] CTA chest showed small subsegmental PE for which he was
   heparinized then transitioned to coumadin for discharge.  INR has been
   therapeutic and repeat CTA today with prelim report showing no PE.
   Goal INR per d/c summary was 2-2.5 given recent GIB; INR currently
   supratherapeutic.
   -CTA chest -> no PE
   -hold coumadin today
   .
   # Positive cardiac biomarkers:  With elevated CK, MB although neg MB
   index; troponin positive at 0.30.  Trop could be up in setting of PE,
   but PE on last admission seems so small (subsegmental) that it is
   unlikely to be the underlying cause of his hypoxia and positive trop.
   EKG did show probable a.flutter with rate in the 120s so demand
   ischemia possible.  Plaque rupture possible as well as sx prior to
   presentation not clear; EKG without significant ischemic changes.  Does
   have ARF, but trop too high to attribute to this alone. --> likely
   sustained recent MI given mild trop elevation and new wall motion
   abnormality on Echo.
   - serial EKGs and CEs
   - Cards consult for further work-up of new wall motion abnormality.
   - continue statin; uptitrating beta-blocker for A. Fib with RVR, ? not
   on aspirin in setting of recent bleed
   - will start ASA in this setting and monitor hct closely
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  Likely pre-renal although poor forward flow from MI also
   possible.
   --> now resolved s/p IVF's.
   .
   # PUD and recent UGIB:  Serology positive for H. pylori.  It appears
   that he was initiated on amoxacillin and clarithromycin on [**12-5**] and
   thus, should have completed a full 2 week course at this time.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI and sucralfate
   - will have to verify full course of amox/clarithromycin
   .
   # A. fib/flutter:  EKG from [**12-17**] shows a. fib.  Does not appear to
   have diagnsosis of this prior to that.  CHADS2 score of [**12-26**] with HTN
   and age nearly >75.  He is currently anticoagulated and INR is
   supratherapeutic.  Do not think rate is contributing significantly to
   BP.
   - uptitrate beta-blocker, hold on [**Last Name (un) 3116**] given acute MI.
   .
   # Anemia:  Appears that hct was normal prior to most recent admission.
   Since GIB, however, hct has remained in the high 20s where it was on
   this presentation as well.  No e/o active bleeding on this
   presentation.
   - guaiac stools
   - sending T+S
   - hold coumadin
   .
   # Lung nodule:  5-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule on [**12-11**] CT chest
   for which a six-month recommended.
   .
   # HTN:  See above.  Holding antihypertensive meds currently.
   - restart diltiazem today for rate control and BP mgmt
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue outpatient statin.
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes prn, NPO for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding from peptic ulcer disease.
- He presented to the hospital with increasing dyspnea and was intubated at home.
- He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.
- His current medications include IV steroids, MDIs for COPD, azithromycin, albuterol, ipratropium, seretide, spiriva, and a PPI for PUD.
- He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, COPD exacerbation, hypotension, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, and positive cardiac biomarkers.
- Further tests and treatments are planned to address these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to a COPD exacerbation or a component of PE with mild CHF. Continuous monitoring and ventilation support are necessary.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and the current exacerbation requires ongoing management with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.
3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline hypertension may be contributing to the hypotension, along with underlying infection, medication effects, or cardiac causes. Monitoring and appropriate fluid management are crucial.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: Although the CTA chest showed no evidence of PE, the patient"

   bronchospastic on exam but air moving poorly.
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - continue serevent
   - holding spiriva given standing short acting ipratropium
   - PO steroids today and monitor for changes
   .
   # Hypotension:  Normally hypertensive at baseline.  Presented with SBPs
   in the 90s where he has largely remained stable despite 6L IVFs.  ? d/t
   underlying infection (UA underwhelming, CT chest without e/o infiltrate
   and no other clear localizing sx of infection).  Also may be partially
   med related (fentanyl/versed) although BP was aleady lower than normal
   on presentation and unclear what he received in the field for
   intubation.  Cardiac cause also very possible given positive cardiac
   enzymes.  SBPs currently stable in the 130's this morning.  Not on
   chronic steroids not suspicious of adrenal insufficiency at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   - pan culturing with blood, urine, sputum
   - serial EKGs and CEs with TTE in am
   - Empiric antibiotics for now
   .
   # PE:  On [**12-11**] CTA chest showed small subsegmental PE for which he was
   heparinized then transitioned to coumadin for discharge.  INR has been
   therapeutic and repeat CTA today with prelim report showing no PE.
   Goal INR per d/c summary was 2-2.5 given recent GIB; INR currently
   supratherapeutic.
   -CTA chest -> no PE
   -hold coumadin today
   .
   # Positive cardiac biomarkers:  With elevated CK, MB although neg MB
   index; troponin positive at 0.30.  Trop could be up in setting of PE,
   but PE on last admission seems so small (subsegmental) that it is
   unlikely to be the underlying cause of his hypoxia and positive trop.
   EKG did show probable a.flutter with rate in the 120s so demand
   ischemia possible.  Plaque rupture possible as well as sx prior to
   presentation not clear; EKG without significant ischemic changes.  Does
   have ARF, but trop too high to attribute to this alone. --> likely
   sustained recent MI given mild trop elevation and new wall motion
   abnormality on Echo.
   - serial EKGs and CEs
   - Cards consult for further work-up of new wall motion abnormality.
   - continue statin; uptitrating beta-blocker for A. Fib with RVR, ? not
   on aspirin in setting of recent bleed
   - will start ASA in this setting and monitor hct closely
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  Likely pre-renal although poor forward flow from MI also
   possible.
   --> now resolved s/p IVF's.
   .
   # PUD and recent UGIB:  Serology positive for H. pylori.  It appears
   that he was initiated on amoxacillin and clarithromycin on [**12-5**] and
   thus, should have completed a full 2 week course at this time.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI and sucralfate
   - will have to verify full course of amox/clarithromycin
   .
   # A. fib/flutter:  EKG from [**12-17**] shows a. fib.  Does not appear to
   have diagnsosis of this prior to that.  CHADS2 score of [**12-26**] with HTN
   and age nearly >75.  He is currently anticoagulated and INR is
   supratherapeutic.  Do not think rate is contributing significantly to
   BP.
   - uptitrate beta-blocker, hold on [**Last Name (un) 3116**] given acute MI.
   .
   # Anemia:  Appears that hct was normal prior to most recent admission.
   Since GIB, however, hct has remained in the high 20s where it was on
   this presentation as well.  No e/o active bleeding on this
   presentation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented to the hospital two days post-discharge with increasing dyspnea and was intubated at home by paramedics. The patient is currently in the ICU with various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a COPD exacerbation, possibly with a component of pulmonary embolism (PE) and mild congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is being treated with IV steroids, MDIs, and antibiotics, and will transition to PO steroids. Repeat TTE is planned to assess for new wall motion abnormalities.
2. Positive cardiac biomarkers: The patient has elevated CK, MB, although negative MB index, and positive troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial infarction (MI). The patient will undergo serial EKGs and cardiac enzyme tests, and cardiology consultation is requested for further work-up of new wall motion abnormality.
3. Hypotension: The patient presented with stable blood pressure in the 90s, which could be due to underlying infection, medication-related effects, or cardiac cause. The patient is being monitored, and pan culturing with blood, urine, and sputum is planned. Serial EKGs and cardiac enzymes are also being performed.
4. PE: The patient had a small subsegmental PE"

   # PE:  On [**12-11**] CTA chest showed small subsegmental PE for which he was
   heparinized then transitioned to coumadin for discharge.  INR has been
   therapeutic and repeat CTA today with prelim report showing no PE.
   Goal INR per d/c summary was 2-2.5 given recent GIB; INR currently
   supratherapeutic.
   -CTA chest -> no PE
   -hold coumadin today

   # Positive cardiac biomarkers:  With elevated CK, MB although neg MB
   index; troponin positive at 0.30.  Trop could be up in setting of PE,
   but PE on last admission seems so small (subsegmental) that it is
   unlikely to be the underlying cause of his hypoxia and positive trop.

   clear, but ? poor PO and prerenal cause; BUN is up as well.  Also must
   consider poor forward flow from cardiac source as outlined above
   (although no e/o pulmonary edema on CT chest so this seems less
   likely).  --> now resolved s/p IVF's.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) presenting 2 days post-discharge, intubated at home after complaining of increasing dyspnea. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, COPD exacerbation, hypotension, pulmonary embolism (PE), positive cardiac biomarkers, acute renal failure (ARF), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), atrial fibrillation/flutter, anemia, and a lung nodule.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a severe COPD exacerbation requiring intubation. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilation parameters is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD appears to be in an acute exacerbation phase, which can be life-threatening. Continued administration of bronchodilators and corticosteroids is recommended to manage bronchospasm and inflammation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline hypertension is presenting with hypotension, possibly due to underlying infection, medication effects, or cardiac causes. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is essential to maintain adequate perfusion.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the repeat CT angiogram (CTA) showed no evidence of PE, the patient's initial CTA revealed a small subsegment"

","Summary:
The patient presented with shortness of breath and chest pain, and was started on non-invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, acute NSTEMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, and acute renal failure, which have all been managed accordingly. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for elevated blood pressure. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but slightly elevated creatinine and troponin T levels. Imaging studies have been conducted, including a CT chest that showed resolution of PE. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications for various conditions and is being closely monitored for symptoms. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's history of NSTEMI and elevated troponin T levels indicate ongoing cardiac issues. Close monitoring and continued management with prescribed medications are essential to prevent further complications such as recurrent myocardial infarction or heart failure.

2. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Proper management with antihypertensive medication, such as lisinopril, is necessary to control blood pressure levels and prevent complications like stroke or heart attack.

3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and current symptoms suggest an acute exacerbation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. He has a history of myocardial infarction, acute NSTEMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute renal failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation and received antibiotics (azithromycin and ceftriaxone). He has been weaned off non-invasive ventilation and is currently on supplemental oxygen. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 165/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His neurological examination is unchanged from admission, and he is responding appropriately. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated troponin levels. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, and an echocardiogram shows new apical hypokinesis/akinesis with an ejection fraction of 40-45%. The patient is being managed with medical therapy for NSTEMI, COPD exacerbation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Potential complications that can arise include worsening of COPD exacerbation, cardiac arrhythmias, and recurrent myocardial infarction."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, and recent pulmonary embolism. He was intubated in the field due to increased work of breathing in the setting of presumed acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). The patient's course was complicated by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient received non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) yesterday, which responded well to respiratory distress. He is currently on NIPPV and receiving antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 65-111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117-150/68-85 mmHg, respiratory rate at 15-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP).

Physical examination reveals crackles and diminished breath sounds throughout the chest, as well as trace edema in both lower extremities. The patient is alert and oriented, but does not follow commands well. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, indicating resolution of the NSTEMI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). He was intubated in the field due to increased work of breathing in the setting of presumed acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). His course has been complicated by a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient received non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) which responded well to respiratory distress. He is currently on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

24-hour events include an EKG at 10:00 AM, respiratory distress yesterday, initiation of NIPPV at 11:00 AM, and a sputum culture at 12:15 AM.

Vital signs as of 12:32 PM show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 85 bpm with a range of 65-111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/82 mmHg to 117/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 15-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.
